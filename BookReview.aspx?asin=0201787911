                <span id="Label1">"The book is of enormous consequence and potential value.  The Java(TM) 2 Platform Security represents an advance of major proportions, and the information in this book is captured nowhere else." --Peter G. Neumann, Principal Scientist, SRI International Computer Science Lab, author of Computer-Related Risks, and Moderator of the Risks Forum  <P>"Profound! There are a large number of security pearls.  I enjoyed and was very impressed by both the depth and breadth of the book." --Stephen Northcutt, Director of Research for Intrusion Detection and Response, SANS Institute  <P>Inside the Java(TM) 2 Platform Security is the definitive and comprehensive guide to the Java security platform.  Written by the Chief Java Security Architect at Sun, it provides a detailed look into the central workings of the Java(TM) security architecture and describes security tools and techniques for successful implementation.  <P>This book features detailed descriptions of the many enhancements incorporated within the security architecture that underlies the Java 2 platform.  It also provides a practical guide to the deployment of Java security, and shows how to customize, extend, and refine the core security architecture.  For those new to the topic, the book includes an overview of computer and network security concepts and an explanation of the basic Java security model.  <P>You will find detailed discussions on such specific topics as:  <P>* The original Java sandbox security model * The new Java 2 Platform permission hierarchy * How Java security supports the secure loading of classes * Java 2 access control mechanisms * Policy configuration * Digital certificates * Security tools, including Key Store and Jar Signer * Secure Java programming techniques * Ways to customize the Java security architecture with new permission types * How to move legacy security code onto the Java(TM) 2 Platform  <P>In addition, the book discusses techniques for preserving object security-such as signing, sealing, and guarding objects-and outlines the Java cryptography architecture.  Throughout, the book points out common mistakes and contains numerous code examples demonstrating the usage of classes and methods.  <P>With this complete and authoritative guide, you will gain a deeper understanding into how and why the Java security technology functions as it does, and will be better able to utilize its sophisticated security capabilities in the development of your applications.</span>

                    <span>The Java 2 security APIs are large, complex, and quite difficult to understand (in fact, their complexity makes me very much afraid that their use will lead to widespread security problems in deployed Java applications, as application writers and site administrators are going to have a hard time keeping track of everything).<P>Unfortunately, this book provides a difficult and dense coverage of Java 2 security. While it is doggedly thorough in its treatment of the security APIs, it does not ease the task of "pulling it all together" for the reader; if your understanding of Java 2 security is fragmentary when you start reading this book, it will not feel any more coherent when you are done.<P>Much of the book has the feel of a "laundry list" to me; it reads as if the author felt he had to enumerate absolutely every security feature in Java 2. The result is that sections that are likely to be of marginal interest to most readers, such as PKI certificate management, receive about the same amount of coverage as subtle and important topics such as domain handling and permission checking.<P>The prose in this book is simply leaden; on a number of occasions, I found myself having to read a paragraph several times, simply to figure out what the author was trying to say.<P>While this book is invaluable for the information it contains (I will grant that it is much easier to navigate than Sun's security web pages), it is a great disappointment to me.</span>

                    <span>This book provides comprehensive coverage of the Java Security Architecture. <P>As with all good security books, this one begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of computer and network security. For those new to Java security, there is also brief intro to security of the Java language and platform. The book quickly gets into the details of the new Security Architecture, with a detailed description of what is there, why it is there and how to use it. Sections on deploying and customizing the SA are of practical use to anyone in this situation. The book also contains a concise and useful discussion of object security and how to go about getting it. There is a detailed discussion of the Java Cryptography Architecture, a must if you plan on using the cryptographic functionality. The book concludes with a thought-provoking section on future directions. This book stands out because of the insightful discussions on why design decisions were made and the implications of these decisions. This makes the book interesting reading even if you aren't going to implement the SA in the immediate future. If you are planning on implementing the SA, don't do it without this book within grabbing distance.</span>

The weird thing is that it introduces a lot of concepts, without actually refering to any of them in the chapters later on.</span>
