                    <span>David Herbert Donald accomplishes with this biography the difficult goal of presenting Lincoln as a character at once thoroughly ordinary and exceptional. Although millions of words have been written about his subject, Lincoln remains shrouded in myth for many of us, but a reading of this fine biography parts those mists and reveals that the sixteenth president is not difficult to understand or relate to, onerous as his burdens may have been to bear.
<br />
<br />Donald's prose is as plain-spoken as the words favored by Lincoln, but that is not to say that it is ordinary. On the contrary: Donald's mastery of his subject allows him to write with exceptional clarity and admirable dispassion.
<br />
<br />While it is clear that on balance Donald greatly admires Lincoln, he never glorifies him. He is critical, for example, of Lincoln the Whig's occasional taste for demagogery in his partisan attacks on the rival Democratic Party early in his political career. In analyzing Lincoln's writings and speeches, he doesn't shy away from pointing out flaws and speciousness in their reasoning.
<br />
<br />The book is also valuable for its ability to present landmarks in Lincoln's career in a clearer light. The best example of this is the recounting of the famous series of debates in pursuit of a Senate seat between Lincoln and his primary rival of the time, Stephen Douglas. History, particularly as it is taught in high school, often presents these debates as lofty philosophical interchanges between the two on slavery, individual rights and the nature of liberty. Donald's careful analysis of each of the seven debates shows that while they contained moments of high drama and keen insight, they were all dragged down by petty attacks -- on both sides -- repetitive arguments and occasional poorly prepared remarks.
<br />
<br />Similarly, Donald points out a fact that is often forgotten: while Lincoln deplored slavery on moral grounds, he never believed that African-Americans were the equal of whites on any level. In fact, the author is quite critical of Lincoln's stubborn adherence to the idea that blacks could be relocated to Africa -- one that he held on to far longer than it merited, if indeed it ever did.
<br />
<br />The most intriguing and insightful portions of the book center on Lincoln's presidency, for which he was wholly unprepared, by his own admission. While many of us are aware in a general sense that Lincoln was under great pressure during his first term as a wartime president, Donald dramatizes the difficulties in great detail, bringing to life the nearly unbearable weight that Lincoln bore in trying to juggle the demands of a highly disputatious cabinet, a stubbornly unresponsive military leadership, and a Republican Party that was in many cases more hostile to him than were the Democrats. 
<br />
<br />Lincoln's final success in bringing the war to a successful conclusion -- albeit at staggering human and financial cost -- is all the more satisfying and poignant for Donald's attention to the four years of disappointments. With the description of his death and the knowledge of the unfinished business that awaited his second term in rebuilding the nation, one is left to ponder more than ever what might have been had he not been assassinated.
<br />
<br />As a finely drawn portrait reveals something of its subject's inner life, "Lincoln," through its meticulous attention to detail, gives the reader a greater understanding of the man than any mere collection of facts could ever provide. Highly recommended. </span>

                    <span>This is one of the few books I have ever read, where, upon finishing the last page, my first inclination was to throw it directly into the trash.
<br />
<br />The author's central thesis that Lincoln was essentially passive misses the mark so completely, that one can't help but wonder if he chose this position merely to be different.  It so far mistakes Lincoln's nature as to be laughable, except that for many people this will be the only book they will read on Lincoln, and to them the author has also done a disservice.
<br />
<br />I think it not a coincidence that the bookcover contains no blurb of praise from the pre-eminent author on the Civil War today, James McPherson, and that this book was not mentioned  when a panel of authors and scholars at a recent forum were asked to name the best single volume biography of Lincoln.
<br />
<br />Read the biography by Benjamin Thomas instead, as the first book to read on Lincoln.  
<br />

                    <span>This is perhaps one of the largest volumes on Lincoln but also one of the best. It goes from his home life to his political career. The book is very fascinating and also very easy to read and understand. This will answer a lot of questions you have on Lincoln, but I also think it will make you want to learn more about him.</span>

                    <span>Regarded by many as our greatest president ever, Abraham Lincoln has left a massive impression on the American imagination.  Much of who he is comes to us as almost folkloric imagery - the young "railsplitter" on the frontier, the small-town attorney, Stephen Douglas' adversary in the most famous debates in our nation's history, the bearded  father figure who led the nation through its most divisive conflict before his assassination at the hands of a deranged actor.  Few biographers have been better equipped to study the man behind the legend than David Herbert Donald, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer and longtime scholar of the era.
<br />
<br />The result is impressive.  Donald sifts through the mythology and interpretations to lay Lincoln bare, often using Lincoln's own words to define the man.  He presents a man of considerable ambition and a healthy ego, which helped him overcome the formidable challenges he faced in life.  While Donald's argument that Lincoln was controlled by events is difficult to sustain, his portrait of a master politician who maintained his authority over a young party though tact and guile is excellent, as is his examination of Lincoln's constant problems with the army high command.  For readers seeking an introduction to the life of one of our most important leaders, this is the book to read.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful biography of Abraham Lincoln.  Mr. Donald has made a very to the point work without speculation and over examination.  It is simply Lincoln, who comes across as simple and well meaning. This is not the Lincoln of high rhetoric grandly leading the country through a difficult time.  Donald's Mr. Lincoln comes across as a man of great potential and high purpose who struggled daily with the complex world around him.  You feel his frustrations and his troubles. This is one book that really demonstrates that history does not just happen.  The outcomes are not known.  The struggles are real.  Lincoln's struggles are real.  Just a wonderful read!!</span>
