                    <span>I have owned several editions of Nemeth's 'UNIX System Administration Handbook' (USAH) and I have always been highly impressed by the quality of writing and instruction. In that book, Nemeth et al brilliantly (and humorously) packed material into 853 pages where other lesser authors (J. Winsor comes to mind) have needed several (dry) volumes. Most Unix System Administration books merely regurgitate or re-word 'man' pages and are entirely useless.<BR>So, being as familiar as I am with their past performances, I did not hesitate to buy this their latest work from Amazon. Understand that there are a lot of similarities between Unix and Linux and as such, this book doesn't really differ that much from USAH. There is still the same highly informative prose, the same humorous approach to instructing via the written word. I think this is an attempt by the authors to capitalize on the popularity of the Linux Operating System and in any other author, this would be gauche. Not so with Nemeth and her team of writers. Here, they have again done an extra-ordinary job of instructing both experienced and novice sysadmins in the fine art and science of being that most noble of professions: a Unix/Linux System Administrator.<BR>Good job!</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book on the subject; it is comprehensive and very well-written. The authors explain not only how things work, but in many cases they include historical background to explain why things work as they do.<P>The book is clearly targeted at professional system administrators. There is little discussion of the GUI-based administration tools that come with most Linux distributions, nor are there enough examples to simply use the book as a cookbook. <P>The book is primarily concerned with server rather than client administration; it won't tell you how to get your sound card to work or configure your desktop environment.<P>For the amateur trying to configure a home Linux system, this may be the wrong book, but for a professional systems administrator, or a developer curious about the mysteries of system administration, this book is a five-star must-have.</span>

                    <span>Yes, the book is not bad... But the index at the end is so bad, basically think that the book has no index if you plan to buy it. That's like everything in linux: it seems great but just impossible to use. :-)</span>

                    <span>For those who need more than simply knowing how to add a new user via the GUI.<P>Covers the whole gamut of Linux Admin. A lot of quality work has gone into this book, and the result shows. Everything you could possibly want to do is covered, whether it be syslog daemon config, mail server config, routing, and there are even diagrams on Serial pin-outs!!<P>"Well done" to the authors. A must have in any admins library.</span>

                    <span>I frequently refer to this book and have found it very useful and informative on just about every subject that is Linux. I would have given it 5 stars except that the index of the book is broken. I use the index of reference books, like all other admins, to quickly find the page of the subject for that I am looking. The page numbers that are referenced in the index are incorrect. This is VERY frustrating! This book shouldn't be the only Linux book on your shelf, but I do recommend having it.</span>
