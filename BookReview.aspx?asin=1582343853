                <span id="Label1">In his third book, Robert Sullivan leaves the wilds of the (<I>Meadowlands</I> and the  rough whaling waters of  the Pacific Northwest to take up rat-watching in the alleys of New York  City. Sullivan learned to appreciate the rodents during nocturnal  stakeouts; a night-vision scope helped him observe rats without scaring  them. As in his previous books, Sullivan uses pointillist details rather than  broad portraiture to paint his subject, and the details in <I>Rats</I>  are devilish. There are plenty of facts in the book to make your skin  crawl, such as a description of the greasy skids rats leave on the paths  they frequent, and a list of garbage items they prefer to eat. But  Sullivan's style is often less that of a nature writer than a historian.  In personable, essayish chapters, New York's history is revealed to be  particularly ratty, with tall tales about the rodents' disgusting  accomplishments going back to the city's founding. Although many people  have never seen a rat outside a pet store, Sullivan reminds us that they  are our constant neighbors, staring out from dim corners and messy  crevices with beady eyes and twitching whiskers. <I>--Adam Fisher</I></span>

                    <span>Author Robert Sullivan spent many nights over the course of a year observing the nocturnal goings-on--rat-watching, in other words--in an L-shaped alley (actually the intersection of two alleys, Ryders Alley and Edens Alley) in Manhattan, just blocks away from Wall Street and City Hall and the site of the World Trade Center. (Sullivan had been trying to trap a rat in his alley in the early morning of September 11th, 2001.) The alley he selected is bounded by a Chinese restaurant on one side and an Irish pub on the other, so that its greasy-slick cobblestones are awash nightly in edible garbage of both ethnic varieties, palatable to aficionados of either type. The alley is, in short, the perfect place to raise children.<P>Rats, as it happens, have a lot of children to raise. Among the skin-crawlingly fascinating bits of information Sullivan provides in his highly readable paean to the Rattus norvegicus, or brown rat, is that both male and female rats can have sex twenty times a day. "If they are not eating, then rats are usually having sex. Most likely, if you are in New York while you are reading this sentence or even in any other major city in America, then you are in proximity to two or more rats having sex." Nor is their copulation unproductive: "One rat's nest can turn into a rat colony of fifty rats in six months. One pair of rats has the potential of 15,000 descendants in a year."<P>Sullivan's observations on rats in general and on the rats in his alley in particular are interspersed with rat-related asides. He includes in his book, for example, chapters on New York's rat-motivated rent strikes in the 1960s and the rat fights of the 19th century, in which single dogs--and more rarely men--were pitted against scores of rats at a time for the amusement of a human audience. Some of Sullivan's tangents are more interesting than others, and readers will differ in their preferences. (The anecdotes of rat-hardened exterminators or urine baths as precaution against the Black Death? There is something here for every taste.) And Sullivan sometimes gets carried away with his poeticizing of the rat's experience and relationship to man. (I mean, they're just rats.) The book as a whole, however, is a delightful look at a rarely-considered world that is, often quite literally, right beneath our feet.</span>

                    <span>Last year when I visited New York City I went running in Central Park, and the very first squirrel I saw was no squirrel at all, but a rat. According to Robert Sullivan, this would have been a good sign of the prosperity of the colony from which that rat had emerged. Rats go out at night, usually, and one edging out during the day means that the colony is pushing out beyond its usual boundaries. Sullivan has made a hobby out of rat-watching, and has written a peculiar and fascinating book about his adventures with his own rat pack, _Rats: Observations on the History & Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants_ (Bloomsbury). It isn't only (or even mostly) about his observed colony in an alley a few blocks away from Wall Street, but about city rats in general and their history of living with us. Because of this, Rats isn't really about rats, but about the humans who have imported them and given them garbage to live on and then have been annoyed when they flourish and stupefied when they refuse eradication. <P>Sullivan found a cobblestone passageway near City Hall called (note the irony) Edens Alley. His fascination for it was founded on the rats' fascination for the provided food, bags of garbage from a market and two restaurants. He spent night after night in the alley, with night-vision glasses and a folding stool. Nights spent there, he spent days doing research, which has lead to some surprising facts; since rats are important to us as pests, there has been a great deal of research done on them, much of it practical and some of it less so. For instance, rats can become immune to poison; even the first anticoagulant medications that were put into bait no longer work in many places, so using them just gives the rats a free meal. Rats are not limited to being pests; they also have been entertainment. In the middle of the nineteenth century, you could go to Kit Burns's Sportsman's Hall to see rat fights. They have played their roles in the unionization of the sanitation workers, and in the civil rights struggle.<P>It is surprising at first to find that the World Trade Center plays a large role in this book. Sullivan talks to an exterminator who says he isn't an exterminator; he is a "pest control manager," reflecting the realistic view that rats will never be exterminated, but might be controlled from time to time, and even excluded from some areas. He had the contract for the WTC after the first bombing in 1993. Office workers evacuated the building, but they left the food they had out on every story to the delight of the rats. "We did top to bottom," he says of the rat clean-up. When the towers fell in 2001, there had been restaurants in the buildings, and restaurants nearby with food out which had to be abandoned, but not by the rats. It was impossible to do any rodent-proofing; the rats could come and go as they pleased. But one firm put out thousands of bait stations, and with good reason. When the technicians descended into the dust-filled lower levels of the foundations, they could see the tracks of thousands of rats which were tracing paths through the dust. The fall of the towers meant that Sullivan could not get into his alley to do more observations for a while, but by the time he did, the rats were back. This is a surprise-filled book of odd facts, strange personalities, and an eccentric narrator, who reacted to the return of his rats after the crisis by being filled with hope. If the rats are back, then the city is returning to its normal operation.</span>

                    <span>This is not just a book about rats, but a book about exterminators, about diseases spread by rats and fleas, and about the history of New York City and some of its colorful characters, and even about the American Revolution. It's a fascinating account of the author's project, inspired by an Audubon painting, to study rats in an alley near the World Trade Center, and how that project led him to learn about that alley, the hill it stands on, the surrounding buildings and the people who lived and worked there, and how the lives of rats and humans have intersected, there and elsewhere and elsewhen. In some ways this book reminded me of Mary Roach's Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers--it's a light and entertaining look at unpleasant subjects, made engaging through the author's skill at connecting the subject to others.</span>

                    <span>I am amazed at the good press that Rats received. Public Radio interviews, reviews in the major mags. Seemed like a must read. What a bust. There is very little about Rats in this book---not more than a few pages. If you are interested in obscure New York History (which is not even slightly connected to rats) then this is the book for you. The book continues to get great reviews, even in this forum. I must have missed something.</span>

                    <span>I heard about this one through the proverbial grape-vine. Had I not, I would have likely steered clear of this book. The subject seems at best boring and at worst creepy. I am so glad that I was able to get beyond those superficial ideas and read this engaging and facinating work. Mr. Sullivan has the unique talent of painting a word picture that transports you into the alley he so often frequented in researching this work. A wonderful book not to be missed.</span>
