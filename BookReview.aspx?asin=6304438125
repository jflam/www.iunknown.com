                <span id="Label1">The parallel stories of a mama leopard and her two cubs and a mother warthog and her brood are tracked in this 60-minute video safari in the Mala Mala Game Preserve in South Africa's Kruger National Park. It's a story of predator versus prey, "lethal beauty" versus "the most astonishing object to ever disgrace nature," according to Academy Award-winning actor James Coburn's rugged narration. (Of course, a generation of kids have grown up with the lovable Pumbaa as their warthog role model, thanks to <I>The Lion King</I>. At the risk of spoiling the ending, parents can rest assured that, oddly, the warthogs all survive.) Cackling hyenas and marauding lions enter the fray and prove as dangerous to the mother leopard as she is to the warthog family. Viewers are not spared the brutality of this truly wild life, and so there are several vivid death scenes. Incongruously, one of them is probably the video's most breathtaking sequence, in which one of the leopard cubs grown up attacks an impala and the two cleave together spiraling through the air in a doomed dance. <I>--Kimberly Heinrichs</I></span>

                    <span>This is an excellent wildlife documentary, which offers great footage and great story about two different neighbors of South African bush, a leopard and a warthog. We see a leopard cub growing up in a difficult environment with many challenges to a young carnivore. Different challenges are imposed on a brood of young warthogs, which proves to be survivors in a dangerous place. The documentary is full of exceptional footage, which portrays every-day drama facing young leopard and warthogs. We see leopards being harassed by lions and hyenas, warthogs escaping predators and surviving the flood in their burrow. There are great moments and thrill of a leopard hunt, unique footage of lions climbing trees in the effort to get leopard's kill as well as a great escape footage of a warthog. Many episodes are shot at night, an active time for leopards. The drama of predator and prey envelops right in front of our eyes. The leopards are portrayed not only as predators but also as prey to lions and hyenas. The warthogs are portrayed as tough survivors in this harsh place. Great documentary!</span>

                    <span>This was an excellent movie. You become very involved with the lives of the family of leopards and the family of warthogs. This is a very exciting video but not for the faint of heart! If you love African wildlife this is a must see! I only wish I saw action like this while I was at Mala Mala reserve. It must have taken them round the clock vigils to capture this enthralling footage! I give it 2 paws up!</span>

                    <span>Wow! Ever seen a male lion scale a tree to steal the just-killed impala from a leopard? It's here. Ever seen two male lions attack, kill, and eat a maimed, full-grown lioness? It's here too. Ever seen warthogs start munching on a dead wildebeest? Also here. This is Africa "in the raw."
