                <span id="Label1">Jonathan Kingdon, one of the foremost authorities on African mammals, has written and illustrated this new field guide which sets new standards in African mammalogy. The author covers all the known species of African land mammal in a concise text providing full information on identification, distribution, ecology, evolutionary relationships, and conservation status. The focus is always on the mammals as seen in the field and on their ecology and evolutionary interrelationships. Introductory profiles summarize the characteristics of the various mammal groups, and the author simplifies many of the more complex groups of mammals by referencing genera. Twelve newly recognized species of bushbaby, fourteen newly named baboons, guenons, and mangabeys and nine newly described colobus monkeys contribute to a modern treatment of the monkeys. New species of bats, rodents, and fox as well as a fully revised listing of the duikers, squirrels and genets are included. Kingdon combines his long personal experience of life in Africa and his artistic talent with the best that modern natural history and biological science can offer. With over 480 color pictures and 280 maps covering some 1,100 mammal species, this book is an essential companion to all visiting Africa or with an interest in the mammals of the continent.  <p>Key Features: <ul><br>* <p>Employs the most up-to-date classification and lists all 1,150 known species  <br>* <p>Focuses on mammals as seen in the field and in their evolutionary interrelationships </ul></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>First let me say that in general I find this book excellent, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the mammalian fauna of Africa. <br>It is very comprehensive, covering every single species of African mammals with the exception of bats, rodents, insectivores, elephant-shrews and hyrraxes, which are usually represented by one species for each genus. But every single genus is represented, and of rodents, every species of squirrel is dealt with separately. <br>The information accompanying each species is very detailed and appears up to date.<p>Now for the shortcomings:<br>1) The illustrations are next to the description of each species. Given how detailed/long the texts are, this means that usually there are just 1 or 2 species shown on each page, so to compare all antelopes you must look through a hundred pages or so - not very practical in a field guide!<br>2) Maps are often pages away from the text and illustration, with no reference to their whereabouts. I often thought there was no map for a species/genus, only to find it pages away, combined with the map for another taxon.<br>3) While illustrations are identified by the species' English name, the maps are confusingly id'ed by Latin names only. If you aren't familiar with the latter, it takes some cross-reference to find out which species' range you are looking at.<br>4) The illustrations vary so much in standard that it is hard to believe they were drawn by one person... While most are quite good, even excellent and life-like, others are quite awful, either showing animals with stiff, straight limbs/bodies as if drawn with a ruler (like the Crowned Monkey) or in highly unnatural positions (like the Potto with the limbs twisted out, or the Cheetah standing up like a circus horse).<p>But again, I still think this is the best guide one can get currently (though Collins is about to publish a new one that may be worth checking out) and is definitely worth getting!</span>

                    <span>This guide book is simply one of the best regional mammal guide books in existance. As well as providing good descriptions of the mammals, it looks at them in the context of their evolutionary history. It does contain a few errors, as is to be expected in a book of this scope. For example, servals are reported from Egypt, where, as far as I am aware, they have not been recorded in historic times. Overall, however, the book is outstanding.I used it throughout a 14-month trip to Africa and it never let me down.</span>

                    <span>This is a great reference for animals, the guide may not be as thorough as some, but in my opinion, it's thorough enough for the average person..and then some. It has detailed information on the animals it lists, and goes beyond many field guides in this respect. I definitely recommend this book for someone who wants a useful book, loaded with well-drawn color pictures.</span>

                    <span>I used this book while in Africa, and discovered that Africans were using a guide to the mammals of Africa that is better organized and easier to use.  I'm still trying to find that other book - difficult when I don't know the authors.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the most complete works on mammals of Africa I have ever read. I wish Mr. Kingdon had written one for each continent. Contains scientific, English, French and German names for each animal and local  names as well (Swahili).Habits, habitat, behavior and everything else you  would expect from such a gifted author, artist, and scientist. The  illustrations by the author are museum quality art. I cannot recommend this  book too highly, simply the best in such a small volume, worth twice the  price.</span>
