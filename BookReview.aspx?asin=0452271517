                    <span>I had hoped this book to be witty and polished, but it fell well of that. The restaurant stories relived in this book aren't entertaining, nor do they offer insight as to the culprits. <P>Still, this book is better than "Kitchen Confidential."</span>

                    <span>I just happen to discover this hilarious book while browsing through bookstore one day. I knew immediately that I would have to purchase it. I have been in the service industry for over ten years. I have exprienced just about everything that was discussed in the book. I too have dealt with irrate,idiotic customers, crazy,perverted cooks, being so incredibly busy trying to wait on several people that at times I wanted to throw my tray down and walk away from the chaotic scene, and I have definitely discovered that restaurant managers are a breed of their own. I have dealt with disapproving sighs and smirks with individuals that think that all I want to do is wait tables my whole life. The fact is, many of the food servers I have worked with are students pursuing very high educational goals. I myself have been woring towards my MSW. A good majority of people believe that we are just these pathetic peons that are down and out. I recall a situation when a customer saw me drive to work in a new car that I had recently purchased. He was completely astonished that I had that vehicle and couldn't understand why a waitress would have a new car. Frankly, like Mr.Henderson writes about, it is good way to make fast money and the hours work well with school schedules,internships, and auditions(although I never personally worked with any aspiring actors). I was delighted (and somewhat relieved) that there are others that have had some of the identical expriences I had including the frustrating and ridiculous nightmares that will haunt you in your sleep when you bolt up from your bed and scream "Oh my God! I forgot to give that table their butter!".</span>

                    <span>I have worked as a waiter, and I have also had the good fortune to work with Bruce Henderson. "Waiting" is a wonderful book, with great behind-the-scenes insights about the fairly universal experience of dining out-- but from the point of view of waiters and waitresses who take our orders and bring us our food. A great deal of humor happens as those seemingly mundane events unfold.<P>"Waiting" is divided up into very funny, easily read chapters under headings like "Celebrities," "Pet Peeves," and so on. Truly an outstanding read, and something that very restaurant staffer should check out.<P>Bruce Henderson is also a really fine singer/songwriter and recording artist with two current CDs available on Paradigm Associated Labels, "The Wheels Roll" from Summer 1997, and "Beyond the Pale," which comes out mid 1999. Bruce is an even better as a songwriter than he is as a storyteller. No songs about waiting tables, though.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Henderson's book brought back all the fun and sometimes horrible experiences I had as a waitress. The author didn't miss a thing. In all, I enjoyed the book. It could have been funnier and more humorous but he writes well and does a very good job of letting those who are in the business "tell it all". My daughter is now a waitress and I will be sending her this book to read and "relate".</span>
