                    <span>This is a great book, very inspiring!! I have several books on the subject and this is fast becoming my favorite. It's so full of color and fabulous art work from several favorite artists of this genre. If you love color and whimsy in your artwork, you will be very pleased and inspired by this book. A must have for your collection.</span>

                    <span>I don't care how many books you have on altered books, artists' journals, etc., this is a book you'll come back to over and over again. It presents material in an orderly fashion, though never in a predictable one. Not only is each technique or idea explained, but there are examples of each. The only people who might not benefit from this book are the ones who need a literal cookbook of instructions: "Take item A, place three inches from top of item B, on the left." Highly recommended both as inspiration and an easy-to-use reference work.</span>

                    <span>I have been familiar with Lynne's art for years and have never tired of it. She has an ability to keep it fresh by constantly pushing herself to try new things. This book is a fine examole of that. I was so pleased that this was NOT "how to: book but more of an inspiring and motivating book. The book sings with color and what a treat after a sepia over dose in some of the paper craft magazines of late. I have had the wonderful experience of taking a class from Lynne and this book was able to accomplish the same feeling of renewal and excitement that her class did for me. I tell my students in my journaling and collage classes that what I like about teaching is that I get to see the world through many sets of eyes and this book provides this experience with the fine artists' work included! You need this book!!!!</span>

                    <span>Money can definitely buy happiness. I used some to buy this book, and am I ever happy that I did. I've been carrying it around with me for a week and I haven't finished reading it all yet. There's so much to see, and such interesting artists to meet within its covers. It would have been great if Lynne Perella had just shown us her own work, but nooooo, instead she has generously incorporated work of many other artists, which gives this book a lot of richness and depth. It's very inspiring to see how simple art materials like acrylic paint and colored pencils can be used in such a fresh way--techniques anyone can learn are presented in an unpretentious, non-intimidating format. Would-be artists are going to be motivated to get out their stuff and start splashing paint around!<P>If you are at all interested in loosening up your own artwork, or just wondering what's up with all the current buzz about journals and book arts, I highly recommend you grab this book as soon as possible, because a couple of similar titles have sold out almost as soon as their first printing was released, and this one might too--it's that good! Buy this book--you won't be sorry!!</span>

                    <span>Here is a book that is both literate and illustrative. Lynne Perrella masterfully writes and provides visual images of how artists journals become. The writer puts you at ease as she explores her own journal development and the work of others. She lends credence and creates excitement about a carved stamp by featured artist Anne Bagby and the advantages of using a repeat image to underscore its potential. Ms. Perrella is an extremely respected visual artist. I find her equally able as a writer. My single disappointment was not having enough, something I rarely voice in books of this genre. I'd like to see more!</span>
