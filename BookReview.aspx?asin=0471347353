                    <span>This book is great if your child has one of the defects listed in the contents page.  I felt it gave a very detailed description of the defects listed as well as questions for the doctors and possible tests and corrections for each defect.  I use this book often when talking to new parents about their child's defect.  The only downfall in the book is that all 35 known cardiac defects aren't listed, so for many parents this may not be the right book for them.</span>

                    <span>Our baby was born 6 months ago with heart defects. Though I'm sure Ms. Wild is well intentioned, this book provides no more information than the American Heart Association's free publication on Congenital Heart Defects  in Children, which our Doctors gave us the day of our baby's diagnosis  (that pub is easy to read, geared towards parents). Ms.Wild's book contains  very "surface level" information. Believe me, as a parent with a  baby that has CHD, we want more information.  I was disappointed, and I'm  sorry but I can not recommend that parents of children with heart defects   purchase this book. We're still in search of a good pub that provides more  information.</span>

It was very easy to follow. Thank you to the author.</span>
