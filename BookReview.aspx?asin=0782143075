                    <span>I knew going in that this would not have much use for me... that's okay, one tidbit of information could pay for the book many times over.
<br />
<br />What i got was a rehash of the now ancient history (2003) versions of Amazon Web Services, and nothing useful from a pratical standpoint. 
<br />
<br />I didn't expect to use the programing stuff (non outdate), but thought the author might throw in at least one example of someone useing this goldmine for a functioning task.
<br />
<br />I'm giving a 2 stars because it doesn't have some of the promised programing discussion, but recomend anyone looking to market books, etc to avoid this one.</span>

                    <span>Amazon Web Services provides good readable information; readers who have limited background in working with web services and the technologies involved will benefit.  This is a great way to start learning about web services in general and Amazon Web Services in particular.</span>

                    <span>If you've never been exposed to XML or SOAP and using web services then this is a good book. However, it is by no means a comprehensive treatment of the subject. The reality is that if you download the SDK and spend a little time on the internet you can find all of the same information.</span>

                    <span>First of all, I had a feeling that i was going to purchase <br>useless book. I just wanted to prove my theory and wasted <br>my money on it. Well, it's good to be a writer these days...<br>Pick up some hot commercial name for the book, add a little bit <br>about everything and here you go - you've wrote a book about<br>Web Services! It's packed of some web links and some discussion<br>of XML and SOAP and everything else what you can find in the kit from Amazon. All in all, don't expect to find anything useful <br>in this book. All you need is the kit and some examples from the Web. I'm planning to donate my book to the local library.<p>good luck!</span>

                    <span>I've been hearing a lot about web services, but everything seems to be vaporware or hyped so much you don't know what to believe. This book puts Amazon Web Services in perspective. It helped me to discover the good and bad stuff without all the hype.<p>At first I thought this was going to be just another Microsoft book, but the author really does cover other languages. My language of choice of Java, but I tried out some of the web page examples too. All the code works great and it includes a lot of comments so you don't get lost.<p>The author made some aspects of Amazon Web Services especially approachable by explaining them in real English. The licensing agreement description was especially helpful because it helped me avoid potential problems with my application. I also talked with the author over email. He answered all of the book questions I had.<p>If there is any fault in this book it's that it wasn't long enough. The author covers all of the services, but you have to read about some of them using another language. I guess it's too much to ask to give me every example in every language, but it would be nice. At least you can find everything you need somewhere in the book.</span>
