                <span id="Label1">&#8220;There are those who spend lifetimes in houses that have nothing to do with who they really are. They may be perfectly designed, yet if they fail to reflect the personalities of the people who live in them, the very essence of intimacy is missing and this absence is disturbingly visible.&#8221;<br>&#8212;From &#8220;a window inside&#8221;<br><br><br>One of the most influential designers working in America today, Rose Tarlow knows that creating a truly beautiful room is as much an emotional matter as it is one of color, light, fabric, and furniture. In <b>The Private House</b>, she offers insights into the mind of a master designer&#8212;as well as a glimpse into some of the extraordinary homes she&#8217;s decorated.<br>Drawing upon her wealth of experience as an antiquaire and a designer, Ms. Tarlow discusses and illustrates simple principles of creative design that are appropriate to any home. Always arrange your comfortable, upholstered furniture first, she writes; pay special attention to how light affects your spaces; and use carpets as background only, never as the focus of a room. <br><br>With chapters on lighting, fabrics, color, and intimate spaces, Ms. Tarlow encourages readers to plan and decorate each area of their house with elegance and personal style, covering all the essential elements of design&#8212;including the emotional ones. The result should be a house that welcomes family and friends, one that enhances our quality of life. <br></span>

                    <span>Rose Tarlow knows more about art history and interior design through the centuries than any living person. Unfortunately, she really isn't interested in teaching you a thing.<p>I read the book carefully and then went through it a second time to see if there was a single design principle or piece of advice I could come away with. Amazingly there wasn't.<p>Rose plays her card close to her chest.</span>

                    <span>Rose Tarlow's home is filled with Museum quality furniture however, the principals she espouses can be used by everyone.  If you are starting your first home this book is wonderful, she discusses furniture placement, how to make a small room look larger and good ideas for using color. Some of the rooms are filled with many shades and others are serenely absent of much color.  I have decorated many homes and found Ms. Tarlow's book filled with good ideas.  I find myself going back and rereading portions of this book, especially when I'm faced with a decorating dilemma.</span>

                    <span>I waited a long time for a Western interior design book that speaks directly to me; it was worth the wait.  Paul Goldberger says it best in his foreword:  "Rose Tarlow's work celebrates the reality of living -- the way in which, out of a complex mist of memories, emotions, aspirations, and knowledge, each of us builds a life that is like none other.  Her rooms are like no other, and they are marked by a natural grace."  Her wonderful, delicate text and intensely satisfying photographs are to return to time and again; this is a treasure that is much more than an obsessive-compulsive personal summary of what antiquaire Rose Tarlow teaches in her UCLA master interior design class.  As she also writes (and I've long agreed), "If I were forced to choose, I would much prefer to live surrounded by carefully selected and much loved books than by indifferent art" -- add the fabulous At Home With Books by Estelle Ellis to your purchase.  A true connoisseur.</span>

                    <span>After reading and flipping the pages of many architecture and design books over the last 20 years, I have found none as fun or in truly informative as this one Ms.Tarlow has put together.  It's her human quality in the writing that really comes across in this book to make it warm and a real learning experience, not like a difficult professor in grad school but more of caring private tutor who tells you all the stories so you learn the lesson not just memorize it. Some of the design situations certainly will not arise in my life (dealing with a kitchen in the pool house comes to mind.) But it's full of great perspective, many lessons and a wonderful read nonetheless. Ms. Tarlow takes us on a journey that is so personal yet so professional and exotic you feel lucky to have been invited into her Private House.</span>

                    <span>This book is minimally instructional.  It's filled with the author's memories of the small things that make life interesting--but they don't make the book interesting.  This is really a poorly-organized memoir, and not a book on design.  The "tips" that the author shares are fairly common knowledge, and it's not worth slogging through yet another paragraph on the joys of a finding a scrap of exquisite fabric in a shop in Paris after a lovely little lunch at an out-of-the-way cafe, and how lovely it looked in Mr. Insert-Name-Here's quaint chateau.  Rose Tarlow should have just written her autobiography and not tried to disguise it as a design book.  Two stars for the fact that it wasn't completely false advertising.</span>
