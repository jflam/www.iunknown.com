                <span id="Label1"><i>Piano Lessons</i> is Noah Adams's delightful and moving chronicle of his fifty-second year--a year already filled with long, fast workdays and too little spare time--as he answers at last a lifelong call: to learn to play the piano.  The twelve monthly chapters span from January--when after decades of growing affection for keyboard artists and artisans he finally plunges in and buys a piano--through December, when as a surprise Christmas present for his wife he dresses in a tuxedo and, in flickering candlelight, snow falling outside the windows, he attempts their favorite piece of music, a difficult third-year composition he's been struggling with in secret to get to this very moment.<P>Among the up-tempo triumphs and unexpected setbacks, Noah Adams interweaves the rich history and folklore that surround the piano.  And along the way, set between the ragtime rhythms and boogie-woogie beats, there are encounters with--and insights from--masters of the keyboard, from Glenn Gould and Leon Fleisher ("I was a bit embarrassed," he writes; "telling Leon Fleisher about my ambitions for piano lessons is like telling Julia Child about plans to make toast in the morning") to Dr. John and Tori Amos.<P>As a storyteller, Noah Adams has perfect pitch.  In the foreground here, like a familiar melody, are the challenges of learning a complex new skill as an adult, when enthusiasm meets the necessary repetition of tedious scales at the end of a twelve-hour workday.  Lingering in the background, like a subtle bass line, are the quiet concerns of how we spend our time and how our priorities shift as we proceed through life.  For <i>Piano Lessons</i> is really an adventure story filled with obstacles to overcome and grand leaps forward, eccentric geniuses and quiet moments of pre-dawn practice, as Noah Adams travels across country and keyboard, pursuing his dream and keeping the rhythm.</span>

                    <span>While Mr. Adams book pretends to be about piano lessons, love of music, and musical adventure, in reality it has little to do with these subjects. "Piano Lessons" is really about a busy middle aged professional, making a half hearted attempt to learn a few pieces of keyboard music. The time he spent rambling on about work, vacations, sailing, and piano purchasing angst, would have been better spent practicing on the Steinway. As a person who began piano at age 40, I feel Mr. Adams can't see the forest for the keys. If he really wants to learn Traumerei, Mr. Adams should practice, practice, and then practice some more. Any person following his path of computer lessons, infrequent practice, long absence from playing, and overambitious music selection, will never realize what a pleasure it is to sit and play a piece of music correctly and with confidence. Mr. Adams - find a piano teacher and go every week. You will be amazed at what you can do!!! In my opinion Mr. Adams did not have enough experience or material on piano lessons to fill a book, so he filled it with all manner of banal fluff. "Piano Lessons" was interesting when it adhered to the topic, and all the rest is unnecessary.</span>

                    <span>At age 50 Noah Adams wanted to learn to play the piano,but had no idea how to go about it, other than to buy anexpensive piano, which he did. The book is his account of how he tried to learn, using several different approaches. It's also about what the piano means to him, and what it means to those who play it well.<P> I loved this book, because I'm only a bit younger than 50 myself, my wife and I have also bought a piano that we can't play, and we also want to learn, but haven't yet begun.<P> This book isn't the Zen-and-the-Art-of-Motorcycle-Maintenance of piano literature, but, like that book, it's about much more than piano lessons. Even if you're not in our situation, you'll enjoy the book, and you'll learn something about pianos, pianists, and about what learning is like. It's not only for kids!</span>

                    <span>Since I'm in my forties and just bought a digital piano to learn and play music for the first time in my life, I thought it would be interesting to read this book for some tips and inspiration. I did, however, find it quite difficult to get into. Perhaps this is partly because I am not American and also because I don't know much about either the places the author mentions or most of the names he drops. But I persevered, and am glad I did, because although I didn't get what I expected I did enjoy reading about the experiences of going to a music camp and the authors encounters, conversations and interviews with various amateur and professional musicians. These were the best part for me, and especially to explore what making music means.</span>

                    <span>An awful book. A preening book. A silly & self-satisfied book.<BR>Adams spends most of it avoiding his piano; attending twee<BR>little piano workshops, fussing with some witless computer<BR>piano lessons, buying a boat with a literary pedigree (E.B.<BR>White!), wondering about those drab people in malls who<BR>wear bright white sneakers & lack boats with a literary<BR>pedigree, and piddling on with his busy life. Meanwhile,<BR>his Steinway sits there! Hey, Noah Adams, if you don't have<BR>the time to put it to use, send me the piano! And throw in<BR>the bench, too! Also, whoever wrote "die yuppie scum", c'mon over and we'll have a sing-along! Everybody else, read "Men, Women & Pianos" by Arthur Loesser for its wit and depth,even if it is way out of date. Or "The Piano Shop<BR>on the Left Bank" by Thad Carhart, a short book that's like<BR>pornography for piano lovers.</span>

                    <span>I was interested in reading the book becasue I recently returned to playing the piano after 30 years and I thought it would be fun to read someone else's experience on the trials and tribulations learning or relearning the music and buying a piano. Unfortunately, Mr. Adam's short reminisecne was short on information about actual playing and such and more about his very busy life with NPR. His book also suffers from "name dropitis" and a sometimes an elitist tone. Passages about "overfed" mall shoppers in "stonewashed" jeans -- followed by the author's refuge to an organic juice bar was plebian writing. I was most appalled by the fact that Mr. Adams purchases an incredibly expensive piano before even being able to read music! I found his struggle and his inability to "get going" and play very inaccessible to me as reader.</span>
