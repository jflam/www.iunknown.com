                    <span>If the phase "a bible of malware" weren't a clich√©, I would have used it to describe this book without hesitation. I read a lot of security (and specifically, malware) titles, but I have never seen a book that comprehensive and detailed, period.
<br />
<br />The author appears to know _everything_ that was going on in the malicious software space since the 80s (for example, who knew that there were viruses written in DEC's DCL language)... A lot of effort is spent classifying various infection, in-memory, self-protection, payload  and other virus strategies. I loved the section on malware self-protection, such as anti-debugging and anti-disassembly tactics and even self-brute-forcing virus code (I never knew there are sooo many of those tricks). Nowhere else I saw the detailed explanation of oligomorphic, polymorphic and metamorphic viruses... Note that while the book does cover the fun historical viruses, its coverage extends all the  way to phishing attacks of the 2004-2005.
<br />
<br />My other favorite part is the chapter on worms. "Vanilla" viruses often feel like the creatures of the past, and the worms steal all the glory. The other holds a view that worms are just a type of viruses that he justifies fairly well. Indeed, there is no accepted definition of a "worm". 
<br />
<br />The book is obviously aimed towards virus defense, although both sides are covered in [at times] excruciating detail. The entire part is dedicated to history and technology of virus scanning. Personally, I never saw it covered with that level of detail. Finally, I had a chance to learn what `heuristic detection' means.  On the defense  side, the book also covers behavior blocking and host intrusion prevention, which has a chance of emerging as the main approaches of virus fighting, supplanting pure signature-based scanning. Similarly fun was a section on network-level defense strategies (such as using ACLs,  firewalls, etc).
<br />
<br />A surprisingly small chapter covers malicious code analysis techniques. I would have appreciated a more detailed info on using VMware for malware analysis.
<br />
<br />Overall, the book is very technical, but (if need be) can be read without diving too deeply into PDP11 assembly &#61514; , just to get familiar with all the malware classifications, infection methods and other tricks. Highly recommended for technical security professionals, might also benefit others in IT and beyond. I think it will also fit the textbook profile for an advanced computer security course.

                    <span>Peter Szor is a genius.
<br />
<br />The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense is a great book from one of the top AV people around.  
<br />
<br />the book is over 700 pages of good informaiton.  There is no filler here.  this is tech writing at its best.</span>

                    <span>Peter has written an _excellent_ book. Bought it to kill some time while waiting on SJC airport. Got to Chapter 9 in three hours - couldn't put it down :)
<br />
<br />Only caveat: some example dissasemblies are (intentionally?) not very clear - and the constant references to previous editions of Virus Bulletin get a little tiresome.

                    <span>'The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense' by Peter Szor is THE book i have been waiting for years.
<br />
<br />It's very well written, very technical and full of history references allowing the reader to do further research. Unlike many books i have seen , this one can be read even if you have like me, analysed many computer viruses in the past.
<br />
<br />The book is made up of two parts:
<br />
<br />'STRATEGIES OF THE ATTACKER' and 'STRATEGIES OF THE DEFENDER'. 
<br />
<br />They cover everything you have ever wanted to read about virus, from Boot Sector to Polymorphic and Metamorphic viruses, Entry Point Obscuring techniques, Generic detections, CPU Emulation and Sandboxing, Kernel Mode Memory Scanning, Exploitation Techniques of Computer Worms and MUCH more!(the list is way too long!).
<br />16 Chapters and almost 700 pages to discover the state of the art of computer virus research. This book is a must read as there is simply NO book that can compete with it.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend it!</span>
