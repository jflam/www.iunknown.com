                <span id="Label1">Targeted at developers interested in leveraging the latest release of Microsoft SQL Server in their applications, <I>Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming</I> is a well-balanced examination of SQL Server 7 that meets the needs of readers of all levels. As author Robert Vieira points out, "even developers who have used SQL Server for years have a lot to get to grips with."<p> This title offers a superb look at SQL Server, but it is addressed to database users rather than database administrators. It does include a chapter on administration, but its focus is on manipulating data programmatically and by way of the product's interactive tools.<p> The author's conversational style engages the reader and clearly illustrates procedures. He also handles the version transition from 6.5 to 7.0 well with feature comparisons between the old and new while maintaining focus on the latest release. He includes introductory chapters on the basics of relational databases for developers who are entirely new to SQL. <p> This book doesn't include a CD-ROM, and a trial version of SQL Server would have been nice, but a companion Web site is available. Whether you want to get up to speed with SQL Server 7's new features or are jumping into it for the first time, this book is a great place to start. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: SQL basics, relational databases, T-SQL, table creation/alteration, indices, views, scripts, stored procedures, cursors, queries, replication, OLAP, English and full-text searches, security, performance tuning, and administration.</span>

                    <span>This book is somewhat of a rarity to me. Many of the other SQL books are, as you can well imagine, very boring. Rob Vieira does a great job making this book flow from subject to subject in such a way that it's almost a page turner. If you have any interest in SQL design (or admin), I'm sure you will find yourself reading this book much longer than originally intended. It is an excellent job.<P>Rob Vieira obviously has real world experience with SQL Server, and it shows between the covers of SQL Server 7 Programming. I'd suggest you read the book from cover to cover, all along the way picking up little tips and suggestions, remembering what you may have forgotten, and learning a whole lot of new tips and tricks that you never knew (or at least I didn't know about).<P>The book's title doesn't fairly represent the content in my opinion. This book covers almost everything about SQL 7 Server, from T-SQL basics through OLAP, tuning, replication (a great chapter), etc. If there is a "bible" for SQL 7 Server, this book is it.</span>

                    <span>Most technical books on advanced subjects leave much to be desired. They are often too academic and are for the most part a repeat of the manufacturers standard literature, (for example Microsoft's literature). Robert Viera has written a book that is easy enough for the beginner to follow and yet aimed at the serious professional dealing with real world technical problems. <P>Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming tacles the challenges that programmers face in the real world and it does it with in-depth discussion and examples. You hardly need to refere to other sources for more information.<P>What's more, I was pleasantly amazed when the author returned my email cry for help within a half hour. I was faced with a Microsoft bug in SQL 7 and Microsoft tech support was no where to be found. Mr. Vieira's prompt response saved the day. I don't expect the author to substitute for Microsoft technical support, but the incident convinced me that he was a working programmer's writing from the view point of a programmer.<P>I look forwards to buying any other books that he will author. How about one on MS Visual Interdev or ASP?</span>

                    <span>I have read both books that Rob Vieira has written on SQL Server (Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming and Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming) and have found that both books are great for mastering SQL Server. There is still a lot of SQL Server 7.0 applications and databases out there in the real world. If you are assigned to develop or maintain such a database, you need to read this book. You could combine this with Thearon Willis' book "Beginning Visual Basic SQL Server 7.0" to get a better understanding of using SQL Server 7.0 and Visual Basic 5.0/6.0 together (and also ADO/RDO/DAO).</span>

                    <span>After all the ballyhoo on this book, I went and bought it. Frankly, I'm disappointed. Were there pages missing or did old Rob forget about T-SQL error handling? With SQL Server 2000 on the street much of what you see here is old hat. Current books cover SQL 2000. This one doesn't. For a guy that apparently spends more times in newsgroups than he does with the product, the self-important style is inappropriate. Go and earn your stripes, Rob.</span>
