                <span id="Label1">From the editors at the world-renowned Associated Press, a guide to the proper use of punctuation--from the apostrophe to the semicolon. <P>More people write for the Associated Press than for any other news service, and more writers take their style and word-usage cues from this world-famous institution than from any other journalism source. In the no-nonsense, authoritative tradition of the best-selling <I>AP Stylebook</I>, the top editors at the AP have now written the definitive guide to punctuation. From the when and how of the ampersand to the rules for dashes, slashes, and brackets; from the correct moment for the overused exclamation point to the rules of engagement for the semicolon, The <I>AP Guide to Punctuation</I> is an invaluable and easy-to-use guide to the most important aspect of clear and persuasive writing.</span>

                    <span>Written with lively and direct prose, Rene J. Cappon's guide to punctuation succeeds in being a useful resourse for the busy journalist. No reader need fear about getting bogged down in the finer points of periods. If such a situation threatens to occur, Capon is quick to suggest a workaround. This leaves the stickiest questions even stickier, a real prickle for someone as persnickety as me. But for the journalist, or journalism student, I heartily recommend it.<P>To those looking for a deeper understanding of punctuation, I caution against this slim tome. Organized into seventeen chapters by punctuation, some of them no more than a half of a page ('The Ampersand') and some as many as sixteen ('The Comma'), the AP GUIDE TO PUNCTUATION lacks the philosophical depth and historical background of recent bestseller EATS, SHOOTS, & LEAVES as well as the dry grammar books of days past. The examples, while fun, are not nearly as comprehensive as one expects in any book that bills itself as a reference.<P>By way of example, here is the entire entry for Irregular Plurals under 'The Apostrophe':<P>---<P>Irregular plurals also take the apostrophe: <i>children's hour, women's rights, gentlemen's traditions, men's club</i>, and so do nouns that are the same in singular: <i>the single moose's antlers, the deer's track, the two corps' travels.</i> The apostrophe stays whether the meaning is singular or plural.<P>---<P>No mention is made that it is preferable to disambiguate the singular and plural in such cases. Especially in journalistic writing, where clarity and simplicity are the twin grails of good style.<P>A dedicated journalist might prefer a true grammar of the English language or the complete and comprehensive AP STYLE BOOK. While they may be dry, they will certainly go a good deal further in answering the questions that arise in all aspects of writing.</span>

                    <span>As a professional editor for nearly two decades, I heartily recommend this book. Cappon's writing is clear, funny, and creative, and he makes the nuances of punctuation memorable. His reasoning is logical, and his explanations and examples are very helpful. Interestingly, though this is an Associated Press publication, some of the style differs from the official A.P. Stylebook. So if A.P. is your background, be aware of this.<P>Cappon is a terrific writer, and anyone else who writes would benefit immensely from this lucid guide to punctuation.</span>

                    <span>If you had any doubts that the media suffers from EXTREME left-wing bias, this book on punctuation should erase them.<P>Rarely does the author pass an opportunity to make rude, offensive comments about President Bush or Republicans in general. Maybe that's your bag, but in a book on punctuation, I'm really not looking for political commentary, and especially not that slant.<P>I can only think that the AP "guru" failed to score a big book contract of his own, and so buried his bleeding heart in this one.</span>
