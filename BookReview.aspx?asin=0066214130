He decides to attend Harvard University to study English. During his studies, he rankles under his writing professors' criticism. As an act of rebellion, Crichton submits an essay by George Orwell as his own. The professor doesn&#146;t catch the plagiarism and gives Orwell a B-. This experience convinces Crichton to change his field of study to anthropology.<br><br> <B>1964:</B> Crichton graduates summa cum laude from Harvard University in anthropology. After studying further as a visiting lecturer at Cambridge University and receiving the Henry Russell Shaw Travelling Fellowship, which allowed him to travel in Europe and North Africa, Crichton begins coursework at the Harvard School of Medicine. To help fund his medical endeavors, he writes spy thrillers under several pen names. One of these works, <I>A Case of Need</I>, wins the 1968 Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allan Poe Award.<br><br> <B>1969:</B> Crichton graduates from Harvard Medical school and is accepted as a post-doctoral fellow at the Salk Institute for Biological Science in La Jolla, Calif. However, his career in medicine is waylaid by the publication of the first novel under his own name, <I>The Andromeda Strain</I>. The novel, about an apocalyptic plague, climbs high on bestseller lists and is later made into a popular film. Crichton said of his decision to pursue writing full time: "To quit medicine to become a writer struck most people like quitting the Supreme Court to become a bail bondsman." <br><br> <B>1972:</B> Crichton's second novel under his own name <I>The Terminal Man</I>, is published. Also, two of Crichton's previous works under his pen names, <I>Dealing</I> and <I>A Case of Need</I> are made into movies. After watching the filming, Crichton decides to try his hand at directing. He will eventually direct seven films including the 1973 science-fiction hit <I>Westworld</I>, which was the first film ever to use computer-generated effects. <br><br> <B>1980:</B> Crichton draws on his anthropology background and fascination with new technology to create <I>Congo</I>, a best-selling novel about a search for industrial diamonds and a new race of gorillas. The novel, patterned after the adventure writings of H. Ryder Haggard, updates the genre with the inclusion of high-tech gadgets that, although may seem quaint 20 years later, serve to set Crichton's work apart and he begins to cement his reputation as "the father of the techno-thriller." <br><br> <B>1990:</B> After the 1980s, which saw the publication of the underwater adventure <I>Sphere</I> (1987) and an invitation to become a visiting writer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1988), Crichton begins the new decade with a bang via the publication of his most popular novel, <I>Jurassic Park</I>. The book is a powerful example of Crichton's use of science and technology as the bedrock for his work. Heady discussion of genetic engineering, chaos theory, and paleontology run throughout the tightly-wound thriller that strands a crew of scientists on an island populated by cloned dinosaurs run amok. The novel inspires the 1993 Steven Spielberg film, and together book and film will re-ignite the world&#146;s fascination with dinosaurs.<br><br> <B>1995:</B> Crichton resurrects an idea from his medical school days to create the Emmy-Award Winning television series <I>ER</I>. In this year, <I>ER</I> won eight Emmys and Crichton received an award from the Producers Guild of America in the category of outstanding multi-episodic series. Set in an insanely busy an often dangerous Chicago emergency room, the fast-paced drama is defined by Crichton's now trademark use of technical expertise and insider jargon. The year also saw the publication of <I>The Lost World</I> returning readers to the dinosaur-infested island. <br><br> <B>2000:</B> In recognition for Crichton's contribution in popularizing paleontology, a dinosaur discovered in southern China is named after him. "Crichton's ankylosaur" is a small, armored plant-eating dinosaur that dates to the early Jurassic Period, about 180 million years ago. "For a person like me, this is much better than an Academy Award," Crichton said of the honor.<br><br> <B>2004:</B> Crichton&#146;s newest thriller <I>State of Fear</I> is published. <br><br> <img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/books/banners/substores/sig7-90-alt4.gif" align="left"><br><B><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="cc6600">Amazon.com's Significant Seven</font></B><br> <I>Michael Crichton kindly agreed to take the life quiz we like to give to all our authors: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.</I><br><br><p clear="left"> <B>Q:</B> What book has had the most significant impact on your life?<br> <B>A:</B> <I>Prisoners of Childhood</I> by Alice Miller <br><br> <B>Q:</B> You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD--what are they?<br> <B>A:</B> <I>Tao Te Ching</I> by Lao Tzu (Witter Bynner version) <br> <I>Symphony #2 in D Major</I> by Johannes Brahms (Georg Solti) <br> <I>Ikiru</I> by Akira Kurosawa <br><br> <B>Q:</B> What is the worst lie you've ever told?<br> <B>A:</B> Surely you're joking.<br><br> <B>Q:</B> Describe the perfect writing environment.<br> <B>A:</B> Small room.

                    <span>Kudos to Crichton for writing an entertaining and educational book.  One has to ask whether scientists and people involved in such causes ignore many of the facts presented to them in favor of seeing things the way they want them to be.  This book is what all good books should be:  you learn something you didn't know, you question things you didn't question before, and you become more vigilent to the way information is presented to you in the future.  Having read all of Crighton's books before, I do find he mixes science and adventure very well, and it certainly is an exciting ride along the way.  He also has good information after the book that is often as interesting as the book itself.  I do recommend this book (highly) as well as everything else he has ever written.</span>

                    <span>With this book, Michael Crichton proves that he has created a legitimate new literary form: the science adventure.  His books have always ended up in a wilderness between science fiction and adventure/suspense, not inventive enough to please SF fans or taut enough to be memorable adventures.
<br />
<br />State of Fear breaks through by making science the core of the story in a way that no fiction writer has done before - and it works.  It most fiction, science shows up (if at all) as a plot device or a fluffy filler for incomplete characterization.  But here the focus is on the facts and practice of environmental science.  The thin but inoffensive plot and characterization draw the reader from one fascinating technical point after another.
<br />
<br />The technical content is solid and satisfying. The author's thorough research is evident on every page (whether or not one checks the footnotes).  State of Fear is a page turner because of the shear number of fascinating examples of risk mongering.  In each case, Crichton locates the core of the argument and explains it clearly.  
<br />
<br />This is not an anti-environment book.  On the contrary, it is a tract for the application of science to public policy.  It also happens to be a breakthrough book for science in popular literature.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I found "State of Fear" to be truly inspirational -- when I finished it, I was inspired to go read a real novel. Or a real non-fiction book. Either one, because this mess is neither. 
<br />
<br />It starts off as tons of fun, like the best of Crichton's work. Sure, there's his usual tendency to flatten some characters into near non-existence: there's a Nepali character who vanishes for pages and pages, only to magically appear when needed to hack an evil computer or rescue one of the intrepid (caucasian) heroes.  His  name is Sanjong but it might as well be Trusty Asian Sidekick. But what the heck, it's an adventure story, not Shakespeare. 
<br />
<br />Crichton also makes some baffling choices. For example, he actually interrupts the narrative to explain the story of the Trojan Horse. Does he think that we are that ignorant, or is this information new and fascinating to him? Best not to ask.
<br />
<br />The book ultimately fails, however, because Crichton can't resist the urge to lecture. Whole chapters are devoted to these lectures, complete with charts (badly drawn charts, at that; you'd think that Harper Collins could have tossed a few bucks to a decent information designer), graphs, and footnotes. I have two problems with these lectures:
<br />
<br />1. A better novelist would have been able to make the same case within the action, characters, and language of the story.
<br />2. Crichton is not a very good lecturer. He's like that professor in college that you knew had a point buried somewhere in his pedantic recitation of data and shrill defense against his critics; someone you really wanted to pay attention to, because that point might be on the test, someone...who...you know...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
<br />
<br />Hollywood almost always makes movies of Michael Crichton books. If you want the story without the lectures, my advice is to wait for the film.</span>
