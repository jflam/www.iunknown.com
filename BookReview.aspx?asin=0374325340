                <span id="Label1">The creators of <I>George Washington's Teeth</I> unhinge the jaws of history to examine the mouth of America's first president, tracking the poor man's dental woes as he gallops to war, crosses the Delaware, and, with only two teeth left, takes his place as leader of the country. Washington was plagued by black, rotting teeth from the time he was 22, losing about one a year until he was nearly "toofless" and had to have his first dentures made from a hippotamus tusk (that's right, not wood!). Poets Deborah Chandra and Madeleine Comora begin their quirky historical tale at a lively clip: "The Revolutionary War/ George hoped would soon be won,/ But another battle with his teeth/ Had only just begun..." Indeed. Evidently he was losing teeth even as he crossed the Delaware: "George crossed the icy Delaware/ With nine teeth in his mouth./ In that cold and pitchy dark,/ Two more teeth came out!" (Cleverly, illustrator Brock Cole mimics Emanuel Leutze's famous painting "Washington Crossing the Delaware," making Washington seem more uncomfortably tight-lipped than dignified.) The story ends happily ever after with the crafting of a nice new pair of ivory false teeth that allow George to dance around the ballroom through the night. Truth be told, however, he would be deeply troubled by his teeth until the day he died. A four-page, illustrated historic timeline of Washington's life (and mouth) completes this carefully researched, very funny, charmingly illustrated picture book that works to humanize a larger-than-life historical figure and in turn, history itself. Brilliant! (Ages 7 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>I was surprised at how well put done this book is, especially compared to some of the children's American History out there, like Lynne Cheney's books.  Unfortunately, I must give it four stars  since the authors neglect to tell us where the "eight human teeth held in place with gold screw rivets" in George Washington's dentures came from.  Or should I say, from WHOM they came?  
<br />
<br />I'll give you a hint.  Take a look at the man who is serving at table "when guests came to dine."  He's also on the cover holding what appears to be a spittoon.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book to share with kids and adults. I learned so many things about Washington from this book. The clever, rhyming verse recounts the lifelong problems George Washington had with his teeth. It is possible that chronic gum infections led to Washington's death.
<br />
<br />The story is well researched and the humorous illustrations by Brock Cole lend a lightness to Washington's serious health condition. The end of the book has facts and information about Washington's life. There is also a great timeline.</span>

                    <span>After reviewing this book for a graduate Children's Literature course, we were surprised to see how much George Washington's teeth played a role in his day to day life.  It was a comical rhyming story that would be appropriate for elementary students.  As Kindergarten and First Grade teachers we would incorporate its theme into teaching dental health.  Young children are often very excited about losing their baby teeth, however, this book would convince them to take very good care of their grown up teeth.  The book could also be used in upper elementary classes to discuss myths, like George Washington's wooden teeth!   </span>

                    <span>We bought this book last year after visiting Mount Vernon.  We had told our (four and five year old) children of George Washington and his teeth since they started regular tooth brushing.  We used the story of how poor George lost all his teeth to motivate them to brush their teeth regularly.   Needless to say, they both have good dental care habits and good teeth to go with them!  This book has cute illustrations to go with the rhymes on each page and made the stories all the more real to our children.  At the back of the book there is a wonderful timeline that chronicles the story of George Washington's life and how his teeth were a big part of it.  The timeline is done in a manner that will make adults appreciate the story of George Washington's life in a new way.</span>

                    <span>An intersting new perspective on George Washington.  It makes him seem more human to children.  Young children are intrigued to have the myth of wooden teeth squelched.  Ther book provides a historical timeline in the back.  This is a great book for children of ALL ages.  Even I, an older child and teacher, learned some things. I had no idea our first president was so obsessed with his teeth and that he had such an active role in the solutions to his dental problems.  Highly recommended.</span>
