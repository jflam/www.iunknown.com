Little do you know, as you check on the price of cattle futures in Bolivia, that you have Jim Clark to thank for this wonderful research tool and time waster. Clark didn't invent the Internet (that was the Pentagon, looking for an inscrutable way to transmit classified information--or Al Gore, if you can believe him) or even the World Wide Web (that was a Swiss researcher named Tim Berners-Lee). Nor did he invent the first Web browser with a graphical interface; that was a pair of University of Illinois computer geeks named Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina. What Clark did was team up with Andreessen to create Netscape, and their first product, Netscape Navigator, made the Net more universally accessible than it had ever been. It also made a lot of people really rich, a fact Clark dwells on in perhaps too much detail.<p>  The story of Netscape alone is thrilling enough, but Clark also gives tremendous insight into the real way American business operates nowadays--the speed, the risks, and the hatred for rivals (<i>lots</i> of hatred, mostly for Microsoft and Bill Gates.) Most of the book covers the founding of Netscape Communications, but there's an epilogue, too, discussing the merger of Netscape with America Online, the ongoing battle with Microsoft, and, most important, the impact the Web has had on everyday life. Clark makes a sound argument that Netscape had a lot to do with that. Oh, and did you know it made him rich? <I>--Lou Schuler</I></span>

                    <span>I found the book to be a reasonably enjoyable read, however I must say that the author's high opinion of himself seems to shine through on almost every page and really put me off. We don't want to know about his boats, wealth, etc... just the story would do.<p>I read a different version, and the cover had just him on the front with a really self satisfying grin. And there were NO photos in the book to relate the story to!<p>Could have been much better.</span>

                    <span>Jim Clark offers an adventurous account of the birth and volatile life of Netscape Communications Corp., the company that produced the Web browser that helped make the Internet a household tool. If the rags-to-riches dot-com start-up story has become clich√©, bear in mind that when Netscape Navigator arrived on the market, the Internet was still largely the semi-private domain of a few academic oddballs. Due to the seminal role that Netscape played in turning the Internet into the omnipresent force that it is today, Clark's book does indeed represent an important first draft of history. The key phrase, of course, is first draft. If nothing else, Clark is a salesman and a promoter, and his goal here is to promote Netscape's version of history - a particularly important goal at a time when the U.S. courts are weighing the fate of the company's arch nemesis, Microsoft. Nevertheless, future historians will use this book in cobbling together the true tale of the Internet's origins, as well as the genesis of the stock mania of the late 1990s. We at getAbstract recommend this dramatic, and sometimes even suspenseful book, to all professionals, whose future decisions concerning the Internet will benefit from the de-mythologizing effect of historic perspective.</span>

                    <span>Fascinating story- especially from the founder himself rather than someone who 'thinks' he knows how it started.  Interesting to read all the behind-the-scenes politics behind the sucesses.  <p>Some DOT COM'S are failing not because of a lack of technology or ideas, but the lack of competent people and realistic vision to shape a releasable, quality product.  You are not a "Senior" if you've worked 2 years.......<p>I would have reviewed this higher if there was more content on the AOL merger (Jim's true feelings) and included an epilogue of the dot coms that he and Marc are involved in right now.  A bridge from the beginnings to the future would have made this book seem more complete.<p>Aside: look at the quality Netscape 6 now that the leadership has changed today!</span>

                    <span>Clark entertains us with his remarkable story about the start-up of Netscape. I liked his garage stories with the young programers he hires that play foot hockey and eat pizza during breaktime. Clark almost admits being narcacistic. No doubt, this man has a huge ego! But that's one of the entertaining parts of the book. I would have liked to have learned more about Andreeson, his chief programer and inventor of Mosaic. But Clark is so caught up with himself, he doesn't think to waste time expanding about others. But once again, his ego makes the book entertaining. To give him credit, he has a great nose for business. He knows how to treat his people and take advantage of new ideas. A real pionneer in the technology age.</span>

                    <span>If you liked Michael Lewis' book,  The New New Thing, about Jim Clark,<br />I think you  will like Jim Clark's ruminations even  more in this book<br />about what  he learned  at Silicon Graphics  and how he  helped create<br />Netscape.   I  also recommend  this  book  as  a superb  case  history<br />concerning  key lessons  about entrepreneurship  in the  Internet age.<br /><p>If  you don't  know Clark's  and Netscape's  story, here's  a quick<br />summary.   Jim Clark  uncovered  a software  approach  to creating  3D<br />graphics while  an academic.  He  left to found Silicon  Graphics, and<br />eventually   suffered  from  conflicts   with  his   hand-picked  CEO.<br />Frustrated by the inability to  redirect the company towards a low-end<br />workstation and  PC-based business, he  resigned at age 50  with stock<br />worth about $15  million.  Looking around for something  to do, one of<br />his SGI  colleagues suggests he meet  Marc Andresson, the  23 year old<br />who  had primarily co-written  Mosaic, the  first browser  (along with<br />Eric  Bina).  Clark's  first use  of Mosaic  was to  e-mail Andresson.<br />They quickly  decided to  do something together,  and Clark  agreed to<br />fund it  up to  three million  dollars.  After two  false starts  on a<br />concept,  they  decide  to  create a  "Mosaic  Killer."  The<br />strategy then becomes to hire all  the people who had worked on Mosaic<br />at  the  National  Center   for  Supercomputing  Applications  at  the<br />University of  Illinois.  That, too, is  quickly accomplished.  <p>The<br />young men except  for Bina have to wait to  graduate from college, and<br />then  a  company  is   built  around  them  as  "rock  star"<br />developers under Andresson's technical leadership.  Within months, the<br />first release of what will become  Navigator is up on the Web for free<br />downloading.   Netscape  quickly  begins  to sell  licenses  to  major<br />companies, Jim Barksdale is hired  as CEO, and the company goes public<br />to an  astonishingly positive reaction.   The company soon  decides to<br />concentrate on software as its business rather than becoming a content<br />provider.  Microsoft soon notices  a new competitor, and the allegedly<br />anticompetitive actions now being ajudicated in the courts take place.<br />Netscape  is sold  to AOL.   Clark later  goes on  to found  his third<br />company,  which is  the subject  of The  New New  Thing.   <p>But, you<br />probably knew  all or most of  that.  Why read this  book then?  <p>To<br />me, the  value of what I  found here was  that Jim Clark seemed  to be<br />pretty candid about why he decided to do or not do certain things that<br />had a very large impact on SGI's and Netscape's success.  As a result,<br />this is an excellent study  in entrepreneurship that considers how the<br />Internet changes everything.   Whether your business is in  the old or<br />the new economy, I think you can learn many valuable lessons from this<br />thought  process  and  its  consequences.<p>Here  are  the  successes:<br /><p>First, one  important thing he did  right was to  fund the start-up<br />initially with his  own money.  His purpose was to  get a bigger piece<br />of the pie for himself and  the key developers.  As founder of SGI, he<br />had  received only  about 1.5  percent  of the  company's market  cap.<br />Early use of  venture capitalists had cost him money  in his view, and<br />he was  probably right.  A  software start-up doesn't  need tremendous<br />amounts of money.  Founders and angels can often fund round one.  This<br />made  it  easier  for  him  to  work with  Andresson  to  attract  the<br />development  team, and  reward them  properly. <p>Second,  his initial<br />strategy was to focus on  getting all of the Mosaic development talent<br />into Netscape.   That also was a  good decision.  In  a new technology<br />area,  the people  are usually  more important  than  the intellectual<br />property.   Spyglass  focused  on  getting the  intellectual  property<br />without the people, and did not do very well.  This looks like another<br />good decision.   <p>Third, he  began selling software  licenses early.<br />This gave him credibility, cash flow, and access to more financings at<br />an attractive  price.  <p>Fourth, he  overcame his error in  picking a<br />leader at SGI and chose  Jim Barksdale.  Clearly, Barksdale was a good<br />choice.  I  suggest you read Clark's thinking  about why entrepreneurs<br />should  usually find someone  else to  run the  company for  them.  In<br />Clark's  case, he  just  isn't interested  in  working on  all of  the<br />details and hanging around.  But  every business needs a CEO who does.<br /><p>Fifth, he went along  with Andresson's preferences to "release<br />early and often" and to  make the software free.  This speeded up<br />development time, and the company's  growth.  This was a key strategic<br />decision.   Clark  quickly  grasped  that Internet  businesses  needed<br />faster  action  and  could  provide  it  than  hard  asset  businesses<br />could. <p>He also made some  errors.  Here they are:<p>First, and most<br />importantly, he knew  that he was taking on  Microsoft ultimately, but<br />did not properly  prepare.  As Sun Tzu suggests,  your strategy should<br />either ensure that you do not have to fight or that the fight is under<br />circumstances so favorable that you cannot lose.  Machiavelli suggests<br />that you always  kill your enemy, because wounded  enemies are lethal.<br />Netscape needed more  and more powerful allies, and  a way to insulate<br />itself  from the  inevitable  Microsoft browser  product  buried in  a<br />Windows package for  free.  I suspect that the error  here was that he<br />didn't  fully realize  that he  had  the potential  to create  another<br />Microsoft.<p>Second, he focused the company on browser software to the<br />exclusion of  content opportunities.  All  of the later  Web successes<br />like Amazon, Yahoo  and eBay could have been  innovated by Netscape at<br />that point.  Clark  didn't want to split the  company's focus, and the<br />browser product was  hot.  In retrospect, he probably  left 99 percent<br />of the  opportunity on the table.   In this case, he  probably did not<br />fully  appreciate the  future  potential of  the  Internet.  A  better<br />solution would have been to start-up new companies with partner and VC<br />funding  to  put these  operations  together.   They  would have  been<br />outside of  Netscape and  had their own  focus and  funding.  Netscape<br />could have been an even more successful version of CMGI.  <p>Third, he<br />ruffled the feathers of the  people at the University of Illinois.  He<br />waited until they were annoyed before making peace.  This disagreement<br />wasted a lot  of time and money, and  slowed down corporate acceptance<br />of Netscape.  He needed a diplomat  on his team earlier on.  <p>As you<br />can see,  that's a lot  to think about  in one book.<p>After  you have<br />finished absorbing and applying these  lessons, I suggest that you ask<br />yourself  where  your  pursuit  of opportunities  and  examination  of<br />potential  risks   may  be  too  limited.   Learn   from  Jim  Clark's<br />experiences to take full advantage  of the potential of where you are,<br />and then you will not need a new new thing.<p>Lead others and yourself<br />into greater prosperity!<br /><br /></span>
