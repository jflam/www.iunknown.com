                    <span>...spoil the soup. The combined regurgitation of 17 authors, each with their own programming style and unorthodox naming conventions makes for a very confusing book. The proofing on this book is absolutely miserable. You had better be a professional developer to get past the myriad of errata in the sample code and text. <P>All in all, the book does provide a decent jumping off point from which to explore the world of VB.Net. Don't expect a definitive manual, though. If you want that, read the online documentation for Visual Studio.Net. In many ways it is far superior and certainly the last word. I did read this book cover to cover and worked through all the examples. Thankfully, I was able to pick out and fix the errors in the code. A less experienced developer may become quickly frustrated with this book.<P>The examples are often academic and rarely provide any real-world insight into the intricacies of application development. Another frustrating point is the continued use of the phrase "...we'll explain that later in chapter 'XX'...". In some cases this phrase is used several times in one paragraph. It points to a lack of organization and planning as to how the material should have been presented. You should rightly be very suspicious about a book that was written well before the actual release of the .Net SDK. I think it would be safe to say that as a result, none of the authors have written production .Net code. And from the look of some of their examples, God help their clients.<P>Overall rating: disappointing. Would I buy it? Probably not. I was able to get my hands on one of several copies floating around at one of my client sites. If you have the ability to borrow it, do so and save yourself the $40. Otherwise, just skip it and read the online documentation that comes with the product.</span>

                    <span>I always loved while working with VB 6.0. Right from the release of Visual Studio .NET, I was mainly looking to learn more about VB .NET. I have read a lot about the changes about ASP .NET when compared with classic ASP and I was really keeping my ears open to know about the changes that took place in VB .NET when compared to its predecessor. Well, I ended up in reading this book "Professional VB .NET" written by 14 well known authors. <P>Simple Statistics<BR>Author(s): Fred Barwell, Richard Blair, Richard Case, Jonathan Crossland, Bill Forgey, Whitney Hankison, Billy S.Hollis, Rockfort Lhotka, Tim McCarthy, Jonathan Pinnock, Matthew Reynolds, John Roth, Bill Sheldon, Scott Short, Jan Narkiewicz, Rama Ramachandran and Bill Sempf.<P>Publisher: Wrox Pages: 943 Chapters: 25 <P>Table of Contents<BR>Chapter 1: Why Do We Need Microsoft .NET?<BR>Chapter 2: An Overview of New Features In VB.NET<BR>Chapter 3: A First Look at a VB.NET Program<BR>Chapter 4: Visual Studio.NET Integrated Development Environment<BR>Chapter 5: The Common Language Runtime<BR>Chapter 6: Variables and Types<BR>Chapter 7: Namespaces<BR>Chapter 8: Windows Forms<BR>Chapter 9: Error Handling<BR>Chapter 10: Creating Windows Controls<BR>Chapter 11: Object Syntax Introduction<BR>Chapter 12: Inheritance and Interfaces<BR>Chapter 13: Applying Objects and Components<BR>Chapter 14: Assemblies<BR>Chapter 15: Threading<BR>Chapter 16: Working with Classic COM and Interfaces<BR>Chapter 17: Comopnent Services<BR>Chapter 18: Data Access with ADO.NET<P>Chapter 19: Using XML in VB.NET<BR>Chapter 20: Web Forms<BR>Chapter 21: Creating Web Controls<BR>Chapter 22: Web Services in VB .NET<BR>Chapter 23: Windows Services<BR>Chapter 24: Deployment in .NET<BR>Chapter 25: Security in the .NET Framework<BR>Appendix A: Using the Visual Basic Compatibility Library<P>Who is this Book for?<P>This book is primarily aimed at experienced Visual Basic developers. Particularly, it is for those who need to make the transition to VB .NET and want more detailed and up-to-date information. <P>An insight into some of the Chapters<P>This books starts with an overview of Microsoft .NET and just how much it changes application development. Understanding these concepts is essential to using VB.NET in the most effective manner. In Chapter 2, the book discusses about the major changes in VB.NET when compared to VB 6.0. If you want to compare VB 6.0 and VB .NET you should read this chapter. <P>Chapter 5 (The Common Language RunTime) is awesome. This has some serious discussions about the evolution of .NET. This chapter also talks about, how Garbage Collector works in VB .NET. In a nut shell, this chapter covers all aspects of VB .NET that you should know. Chapter 6 and 7 discusses about datatypes and Namespaces respectively. Namespaces encapsulate the very building blocks of .NET. Chapter 7 has all about Namespaces. Well, upto Chapter 7, the book gives us an over all idea about the new VB .NET. In the coming chapters, it takes us to the real world of VB .NET. <P>Windows Forms is discussed in Chapter 8. It teaches you how you can create forms in VB .NET. The new cool feature of VB .NET is its error handling. We have a new error handling mechanism, which is called as "Exception Hanldler". Chapter 9 describes the new error handling methods. The highlight of this book is yet to come. Chapter 10 takes you to world of creating "Custom Windows Controls". <P>In earlier versions, VB 6.0, it was really hard time for developers to keep track of the versions of the Component that we are developing. Registering a component, unregistering a component, change in compatibility blah blah blah. Now with VB.NET, versioning is very simple. Chapter 14 has an overview of, how versioning is done in VB.NET. <P>Tell me any business who do not work with storing and retrieval of information. Data Access with ADO.NET is discussed in chapter 18. You also get to know about working with XML in "Using XML in VB.NET". We also have a chapter which goes through about creating a Web service, how to consume a Web Service. <P>Creating a Windows Service is very easy with VB.NET. We can easily create Windows Services by creating an application that is installed as a service. For example, suppose we want to monitor for files in a directory and react to the data in those files. We could write a Windows Service application that waits for those files, extracts the information and then starts another process to use that data. The chapter 23, "Windows Services", has some good examples about creating a File monitor, writing events using E-mail and creating a Remoting Service. This chapter also discusses about how to debug a Service. This chapter is really awesome. <P>In Appendix A, we have a great discussion about the compatibility library. This library will assist in the conversion of existing code, as well as providing backward compatibility and support for developers who are transitioning to the new version. <P>I find only good things with this book. It has everything that a experienced VB developer should know. You can very well add this book to your collection.</span>

                    <span>This book is not based on Visual Studio.Net Final Release! <P>I have read the book front to back including introduction page. I just realized that the book was based on beta 2 of Visual Studio.Net, too late for a refund. Anyway, I went on to read it and found out that the book was not very much organised as tons of '...we'll discuss this on chapter xx ... ' appear no less than 5 times in a single chapter (on some chapters). Mispelled words also are catching enough to say that this book was in a hurry to be printed.<P>If you're looking for a book that covers thorough details on window forms and web form control howtos, this wouldn't give you enough detail on those topics. Web Services is equally a mere introduction, with about two pages of discussion on UDDI as well as WSDL. Not much on ADO.Net and XML. <P>I should have borrowed this book instead and skim through it or should have bought it for 20 bucks less. Besides, it's already outdated. I hope the same authors would come up with a second edition that has richer detail...and send me a free copy.</span>
