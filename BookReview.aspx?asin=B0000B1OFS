                    <span>This DVD leads us through time to examine the strength of the Earth¡¦s magnetic field through various perspectives, from potteries to volcano rocks. It also briefly describes the consequences of Earth without the protection of the magnetic field, how Earth generates the magnetic field, and when the next reversal of magnetic field occurs. <P>I find that the information on the DVD is not detailed enough. However, the PBS website (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/magnetic/) gives me a better understanding of the Earth¡¦s magnetic field.</span>

                    <span>This film probes the problem of the Earth's magnetic field. The nature of the Earth's magnetic field provides a shield to protect us getting bursted from cosmic rays and radiation. Scientists have found that the Earth's magnetic field is rapidly weakening, and even reversing in some future. Yes, compass will point to south someday. The film only focuses on the reversing of the Earth's magnetic field; however, it does not cover much of the details about the damages to our people and our earth during this reversing phenomena. It does not mention any government special project groups working on solution or prevention to this magnetic storm. Strong contents on telling how the Earth's magnetic field works and the reversing fact, but weak on covering the consequences from the reversing cause.<P>Unlike NOVA's Elegant Universe, this DVD only gives a 55 min. show and does not provide extra feartures and educational softcopy materials. I recommend you may get a copy from your local library, watch it and decide your purchase.</span>

                    <span>This is an entertaining, informative, and even-handed look at the Earth's magnetic field, how it has changed over time, what it is doing now, and what it all might mean.<P>The computer graphics used are interesting and effective, but the most interesting part was the (previously unknown to me) magnetic history stored in volcanic rock. Some of the conclusions they draw from this work can really make you think.<P>Although documentary DVDs are usually not very cost effective, giving you a (if you're lucky) 1-hour program for the price of a 2-hour blockbuster movie, this one is worth a try. And as the Earth's magnetic field continues to change (it's clearly in the midst of a fast-moving decline right now), this could be a good source of entertaining info to review later.</span>
