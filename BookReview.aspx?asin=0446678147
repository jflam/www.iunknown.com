With clarity and wit, Beckel guides readers from their first day to becoming a manager, intermingling her real-life experiences from the office of all offices-The White House.

                    <span>Wow. Be A Kickass Assistant is my new bible. This book offered a zillion tools to help me be a better assistant. I loved reading about The White House, and even though my boss isn't as cool as George, we've already discussed several things from the book that we're going to implement. My favorite thing about the book was that it gave me a new outlook on my job and about myself. Thanks, Heather Beckel.</span>

                    <span>The writer has great writing style and all, but it's really for the newcomers in the world of professional administration.<P>I was impressed by the title of the book. My style of reading? I read the cover, backcover, contents and introduction. Then, I briefly scanned the book. I like the presentation. What's really lacking is the content when I really dig into it. I had the expectation that it's for the 'take-your-career-to-the-next-level' readers (seasoned office professionals), but it's not.<P>The information provided, particularly the "Appendix" is very USA but the concepts and principles are very relevant. Having worked and still do, in large American corporations, I find it easy relating to the book.<P>Having said all that, it still makes a GREAT book for everyone who is NEW and ASPIRES to be the BEST admin you could ever be - A KICKASS ASSISTANT. Happy reading!</span>

                    <span>I bought the e book which was nice because I got it the same day but no nice since I can not print it or copy it for notes. This book is very good for new assistants. I would have liked to have read more ideas than hear all the stories. It was an okay book I probably would not recommend it. I was pulled in by the strong title.</span>

                    <span>This is not your typical secretarial manual. There is nothing dry, staid, or boring here. This book is for folks who want to go places, and don't want to get stuck in the "Admin" trap. I loved it, and will continue to reference it for my current job. I will even refer to it when I have my own assistant in the future.</span>

                    <span>As a graduating college senior this was such a helpful guide to helping me land a great internship with a company where I would be doing a lot of office work. It helped me understand and become a great intern and will hopefully lead to a job offer. This book really taught me to become a good office worker and to shine to my boss. This book was so helpful to learning about the assistant culture and for getting me ahead of other interns by always doing a bang up job.</span>
