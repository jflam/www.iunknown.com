                <span id="Label1">"A voice like yours," celebrated conductor Arturo Toscanini told contralto Marian Anderson, "is heard once in a hundred years." This insightful account of the great African American vocalist considers her life and musical career in the context of the history of civil rights in this country. Drawing on Anderson's own writings and other contemporary accounts, Russell Freedman shows readers a singer pursuing her art despite the social constraints that limited the careers of black performers in the 1920s and 1930s. Though not a crusader or a spokesperson by nature, Marian Anderson came to stand for all black artists-and for all Americans of color-when, with the help of such prominent figures as Eleanor Roosevelt, she gave her landmark 1939 performance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, which signaled the end of segregation in the arts. 	Carefully researched, expertly told, and profusely illustrated with contemporary photographs, here is a moving account of the life of a talented and determined artist who left her mark on musical and social history. Through her story, one of today's leading authors of nonfiction for young readers illuminates the social and political climate of the day and an important chapter in American history.  Notes, bibliography, discography, index.</span>

                    <span>Writing a biography of a private person who led a public life is, by definition, difficult.  So it only stands to reason that writing a children's biography of a private person who led a public life would be ten times as hard.  Children's biographies cannot speculate over the sex life of the subject.  They can't delve into shoddy rumors or dredge up conspiracy theories related to the person's sordid background.  None of this is to say that Marian Anderson had such sketchy rumors floating about her person, of course.  By all accounts she led an exciting life, had a fabulous career, and is regarded as a great American hero.  But she was also a private person, which places Russell Freedman in a difficult position.  As the author of, "The Voice That Challenged a Nation", Freedman's job is to tell Anderson's story while relying on as many good, strong, clean facts as he can get his hands on.  Fortunately, we're talking about the premiere biographical children's author here.  Alongside fellow genius James Giblin, Freedman knows exactly how to present a life this interesting and detailed.  The book will not charm every child assigned it in school.  But if you've a kid who's open-minded and able to get into Marian's struggle, this is an excellent resource.  Even if, prior to this book, they couldn't tell Marian Anderson from Ella Fitzgerald.
<br />	
<br />The book opens with what is inarguably Anderson's greatest moment in the public eye.  She stands on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a crowd of 75,000 people below her, waiting to hear her sing.  The date is April 9, 1939, and Anderson has been refused the chance to perform at Constitution Hall.  Anderson is black and the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution) is inherently racist.  With this concert, under the shadow of Lincoln himself, Anderson gives a heckuva performance that stands as a dignified response to racism in America.  It goes very well and from here we shoot back and see Ms. Anderson's life in full.  From her early days as a choir member in Philadelphia to her triumphant European tour in the early 30s.  Certain aspects of Marian's life repeat themselves.  She was wholly dedicated to her mother and took her everywhere.  She was uncertain of her own talents at times but continued to sing and conquer.  Freedman expertly weaves fascinating aspects of Marian's life (example: her high school boyfriend waited some twenty years to marry her) with factual information about the times in which she lived.  Kids who read this book learn just as much about Jim Crow laws and deeply imbedded segregation as they do about Ms. Anderson's life.  By the end of the book you find yourself emerging with a fascinating look at a truly great woman.
<br />	
<br />Freedman follows up this book with an extensive bibliography (which gives props to fellow fabulous child biography, "When Marian Sang" by Pam Munoz Ryan).  There's also a discography, a series of picture credits, and a wonderful index.  It seems petty to demand that an author (or publisher) bend even farther backwards after producing such a gorgeous book, but I was a teensy bit sad that "The Voice That Challenged a Nation" didn't have a small cd accompanying it.  When you read a quote, like the one from opera and concert singer Jessye Norman saying that, "If the planet Earth could sing, I think it would sound like Marian Anderson", you want to hear that voice.  Not just read about it.  But as I said, them's small potatoes.  As it is, this may be one of those few children's books that inspire kids to search for Marian Anderson recordings on itunes (which has a lovely selection, by the way).
<br />	
<br />With some authors, you know to trust them.  You pick up their latest work without a smidgen of doubt in your mind that what you're about to peruse is going to impress you.  After Freedman won my respect with his glorious, "Eleanor Roosevelt: A Life of Discovery" (Eleanor shows up quite a lot in this book as well, I'm pleased to report), I expected nothing but the best from his Marian Anderson bio.  And the best it is.  A fine selection for any library, whether personal or public, anywhere.

                    <span>"This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, 'My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.' 
<br />"And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!
<br />
<br />"Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!
<br />
<br />"Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!
<br />
<br />"But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!
<br />
<br />"Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!
<br />
<br />"Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring..."
<br />
<br />--Martin Luther King, Jr., August 28, 1963 
<br /> 
<br />Dr. King must surely have had a thought or two of Marian Anderson as he stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on that historic afternoon and delivered those words.
<br /> 
<br />Many of us know Marian's basic story: 
<br /> 
<br />Marian Anderson was a helluva singer.
<br /> 
<br />Despite being celebrated in Europe as the voice of a century, and despite having the strong support of the President's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, Marian Anderson was denied the opportunity to perform in Constitution Hall in Washington, DC because it was owned by the Daughters of the American Revolution, and those ladies didn't allow no black folks to be singing in their hall.  That refusal led to Marian performing instead from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for a crowd of 75,000 people on the Mall and a nationwide radio audience.  
<br /> 
<br />She stood up tall where Martin would stand a quarter-century later and led off her performance with a rendition of My County 'Tis of Thee.  
<br /> 
<br />Her performance is seen as a historic event at the dawn of the modern Civil Rights movement.
<br /> 
<br />Two years ago, Pam Munoz Ryan and Brian Selznick created the stunningly beautiful 40 page picture book, WHEN MARIAN SANG (Scholastic Press, 2002), which won all sorts of awards including a Sibert Honor.
<br /> 
<br />Now Russell Freedman has written a beautiful and more detailed biography of Marian Anderson which will similarly captivate readers with its engaging text and its clear, oversized photographs of the singer herself and of supporting characters in the story of Marian Anderson.
<br /> 
<br />The most precious of those supporters were also some of the earliest.  Through the chapters focusing on her earliest years, I was moved by Freedman's portrayal of how Marian's childhood community came through time and time again to insure that her dreams would not be in vain:
<br /> 
<br />"Again there was no money for lessons.  Most of Marian's earnings from concert appearances went to her mother, who was still taking in laundry and scrubbing floors, and to her sisters, who were still in school.  And again the congregation at Union Baptist Church came to Marian's aid, organizing a benefit concert that raised $566 so that she could study with Boghetti."
<br /> 
<br />Equally moving is the subplot of her life that involves Orpheus Fisher:
<br /> 
<br />"I don't wanna wait in vain for your love"  --Bob Marley
<br /> 
<br />Having had to quit school after eighth grade in the wake of her father's death, Marian did not complete high school until she was twenty-four.  It was during her delayed high school years--back when America was engaged in the First World War--that Marian met Orpheus Fisher who, "like her, was still in high school.  He fell for the shy singer with the soft laughter and huge sparkling eyes who was almost as tall as he..."  
<br /> 
<br />Decades later, America was midway through the Second World War when Marian finally relented and married Orpheus, who has tirelessly and faithfully pursued her all those years, while she was single-mindedly focused on her career.
<br /> 
<br />And what a career it was:
<br /> 
<br />"During one ten-month period she gave 123 concerts in fifteen different countries, performing a repertoire that included over two hundred songs and arias in German, Italian, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, and other languages."
<br /> 
<br />It must have been amazingly disheartening for Marian Anderson to return home from entertaining European royalty and once again come face to face with Jim Crow.  Like black sports stars of that era, Marian faced dangerous and humiliating conditions when traveling and performing around some regions of our "sweet land of liberty."  And yet, in photos, she appears both to have left that all behind and to be channeling some kind of higher power as she sings.
<br /> 
<br />" 'It was music-making that probed too deep for words.' "
<br /> 
<br />Marian Anderson remains a symbol of the historic fight to let freedom ring for all Americans.  In VOICE THAT CHALLENGED A NATION, Russell Freedman goes far beyond the symbolic to provide us a memorable look at the life of a singer whose talents knew no bounds.
