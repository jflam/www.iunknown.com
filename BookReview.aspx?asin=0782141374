                <span id="Label1">Apache continues to be the leading open source web server in the industry, and Sybex has the information you need with a revised edition of Linux Apache Web Server Administration, the book selected as one of "Top Five Linux Books" by Linux Online. Fully updated to cover  the newest version of Apache, v. 2.0, as well as the latest Linux kernel, v. 2.4, and Red Hat 7.2, this second edition provides clearly written and focused explanations of the real-world issues that Apache administrators can expect to encounter on the job. The authors take you step-by-step through all the standard and advanced techniques you need to know to administer Apache on a Linux box, using dozens of clear, consistent examples to illustrate these techniques in detail-so you stay on track and accomplish all your goals. This book is part of the Craig Hunt Linux Library, which has earned the reputation as the most comprehensive, well-written, and appropriately targeted Linux series available.</span>

                    <span>Everything you need to know about v.1.3, but with Apache 2.0 just around the corner (currently in beta), you might want to hold off until the 2nd edition. This edition touches very briefly on 2.0, providing a general overview of what to expect, but no meat. A lot remains the same, but some critical things are different, and clear documentation of the kind that this book provides for 1.3 is scant. Hopefully something will come out before too long fill the void. <P>Of course, Apache 1.x is no slouch, has the majority share of servers on the web currently, could be all you need and more. If you're inclined towards the tried, tested, and true, and shun the unproven, consider this a 5 star recommendation for an excellent book on an excellent, if somewhat venerable, web server.</span>

                    <span>There is a lot of good information contained in this book just waiting to get out. Unfortunately, the poor chapter organisation and the abyssmal index makes finding the information you need (or trying to find it later) a frustrating experience. There's also a lot of padding with CGI and PHP scripts that didn't seem to serve any purpose unless you really wanted to learn how to program 'hello world'. Overall, it will teach you the gist of administrating an Apache Web Server, but I found it disappointing.</span>

                    <span>Excellent instructions, and an amazing companion to the O' Reiley book. Takes the guesswork out of Linux Apache admin, and is a handy tool for any other Unix folks as well.<P>It's so nice to read a technical book that is accurate and in English not geek.</span>

                    <span>Having spent a great deal of time wrestling with the more arcane aspects of administering a web server I've read way too much about the Apache server.<P>This may well be the one book written about Apache that turns into a must buy. It covers earlier in the learning curve and has much better prose than Kabir's "Apache Server Administrator's Handbook" and covers more than Laurie's "Apache: The Definitive Guide". While the sections on Perl, PHP and CGI are not extensive they cover all an Apache administrator needs to know to support the programming efforts of others. I found the sections on troubleshooting and security particularly useful. <P>I had already compiled Apache from source a number of times so cannot really tell how useful this section might be to the newcomer but it seems to cover everything you need to know to custom build your own httpd binary from source.<P>The section on configuring Apache is marvellous, I learn something from it every time I open it to assist in reconfiguring a server.<P>This book is well written, up to date, concise and authoratitive. It has good examples, good explanations and leaves out almost nothing. Everything a computer book should be. I feel that anyone who is starting down the Apache road should buy this book, any real need for earlier information is adequately addressed by the Apache manual while no other volume covers so much of the rest you need to know as well.</span>

                    <span>You can't go wrong with this book if you need a reference book concerning Linux and Apache Web Server Administration.<P>Author Aulds has a way with words, and he makes the subject easy to digest mixed with a dose of magical clarity. He is up to date, and this book covers besides Perl and CGI, PHP. Good selection of examples which anyone can use in everyday Apache Web administration shows the author's vast experience which is tempered with an equal amount of theorectical expertise.<P>Highly recommended.</span>
