                    <span>Russian is a very hard language for native English speakers to pronounce correctly. There are sounds in Russian that are not only not made in English, but are difficult for the non Russian to even HEAR, like the soft consonants. I originally thought I could get my pronunciation right by mimicking Pimsleur lessons and using a text book, but after being corrected again and again by my Russian friends, I decided to give this a try. <P>This book covers everything related to pronunciation. There are diagrams indicating the position of your tongue and lips, examples of the words where the individual sounds are used, pronunciation rules, and finally, proper intonation of sentences to acheive a proper accent. This is an excellent tool at a very reasonable price.<P>I'd give it five stars if it came on a CD instead of cassettes. I can't believe they still use the wretched things.</span>

                    <span>This cassette/tape combo is a great learning tool for Russian pronunciation. It contains detailed diagrams that show how the mouth should be formed for each letter. The two tapes (90 min. each) are very clear and easy to understand. The course takes you step-by-step, teaching you the sound and name of each letter of the Russian alphabet. It goes even further to give you an understanding of certain rules of the alphabet. You also learn sentences and read certain literary passages such as a passage from Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. This compact course contains eleven units and a small English/Russian glossary in the back. The only complaint I have is that the speakers do not give you enough pause-time to say the words yourself (you might have to stop the tape in order to pronounce a word). Other than that I highly recommend it along with the New Penguin Russian Course.</span>

                    <span>This is a decent introduction, although there are better audio learning programs available. The main flaw is that the announcers are rushed and seem to be shouting at you. (You can't understand, I'll speak louder). The rushing results in an even greater flaw, the pauses are not long enough for the listener to repeat the words without speaking over the next word he or she is supposed to be listening to. It is, however, a much less expensive introduction than, say, Pimsleur and could be worthwhile for that reason.</span>

                    <span>The Pronounce it Perfectly in Russian tapes and book have made learning a second language very easy. I have tried to learn other languages before and tossed the books and tapes. Upon inserting the tape into the player and listening for only a few seconds I was actually learning words with ease. I would suggest this product to anyone wishing to learn the beautiful Russian language.</span>
