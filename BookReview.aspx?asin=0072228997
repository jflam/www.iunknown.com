                    <span>Ambiguous content with statements such as light can be very useful... AND! This book is of no value to any one who is remotely interested in greating/building actual game worlds. You would be better off giving the book a miss and check the forums out on the internet. I am gutted that I made the mistake of reading and believing the comments made on the books contents which now seems obvious these were placed by the authors friends and relatives. It's a pity Amazon do not accept returns! As such the book is destined for the bin. </span>

                    <span>If your not in the gaming industry, but want to be, then this book will be a very valuable resource to you.  For me, it was a welcome break from reading all software books.  Which you must also do to get into gaming, or at least the art or programming jobs.  This book reveals little known facts such as getting a job in the QA dept of a game company is a great way to get in if your not an artist or programmer.  It also paints a picture of an industry that has its problems like anything else.  Great chapters are included that discuss level mapping concepts and design techniques that are sure to boost ones though process as well as good interviews with key gaming gods. It simply does a great job at covering the gamut that is games.  The author also gives you some good tips on what game developers "who hire" think like, cause he probably has done it.  Must read for any potential game industry people.  Harsh reality in many ways.</span>

                    <span>"Ultimate Games Design" There seems to be no shortage of games design books, and they all claim to be the ultimate. All of them wants to deal primarily with the big fluffy ideas of the lead design - the overall idea of the game and so forth. Few of them has anything to say about the actual execution in terms of level design for example.<p>Untill now. Despite hating the title (and the colour scheme) of this book, I have to bow to the ultimate thing. This is as good a good as you will get right now about actually building game worlds - the level designs, the modelling, the texturing, the lighting and so forth. It also has one of the mandatory chapters on getting into the industry, where Tom Meigs goes beyond the usual war stories from the pros and repetitive listing of roles in the games industry, to actually offer the reader a good ammount of introspective questions to ponder and sage advice to gear up for the bumpy ride ahead.<p>So from hating it, this book has become one of my absolute favourites on games design. Well done Tom Meigs, whoever you are!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book!  I have some limited experience in game development, and this book really helped fill in the blanks for me.  It was highly recommended by a friend who already works in the game industry -- and on several websites.  I wasn't disappointed.  I think it's the best book available.  The book flowed easily from chapter to chapter.<p>Previsualization - Level Planning and Building - Lighting - Texturing - Particles - Effects - Actors - Props - Audio<br>Camera Control - Genre Design - Scripting - QA - MMOGs - Wireless<p>It's all covered in pretty balanced detail. I finally feel like I understand how all this stuff relates in building a game and no single book had helped me this way before.<p>I bought several other books on game design - but they were either too general or didn't really seem to cover the stuff you need to really get going in this area.  Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>This book is very useful, it has provided many information not found elsewhere. I highly recommend this book. As a game designer myself, it has been helpful for me in many ways.
<br />
<br />The whole process of game production is really helpful in getting the grasp of how the whole corporate process work. If your going to get into a company like EA or Activision. Its a good heads up to learn about the industry and design worlds that would sell.</span>
