                <span id="Label1"><b>From the bestselling author of <i>The End of Nature</i> comes a passionate plea to limit the technologies that could change the very definition of who we are</b><br><br>We are on the verge of crossing the line from born to made, from created to built. Sometime in the next few years, a scientist will reprogram a human egg or sperm cell, spawning a genetic change that could be passed down into eternity. We are sleepwalking toward the future, argues Bill McKibben, and it&#8217;s time to open our eyes.<br><br>In <i>The End of Nature</i>, nearly fifteen years ago, McKibben demonstrated that humanity had begun to irrevocably alter&#8212;and endanger&#8212;our environment on a global scale. Now he turns his eye to an array of technologies that could change our relationship not with the rest of nature but with ourselves. He explores the frontiers of genetic engineering, robotics, and nanotechnology&#8212;all of which we are approaching with astonishing speed&#8212;and shows that each threatens to take us past a point of no return. We now stand at a critical threshold, poised between the human past and a post-human future. <br><br>Ultimately, McKibben offers a celebration of what it means to be human, and a warning that we risk the loss of all meaning if we step across the threshold. His wise and eloquent book argues that we cannot forever grow in reach and power&#8212;that we must at last learn how to say, &#8220;Enough.&#8221;<br></span>

                    <span>I can't argue the science presented in "Enough" and I do not think that is the point of the book.  This is not a scientific treatise or a technical analysis of the subjects raised in the book.  Instead, it is a moral tale, not unlike a sermon, and it does not pretend to be something other than that.  I found it to be extremely engaging, frightening too.  Why not?  Not everyone will agree with the points made by Bill McKibben, which is fine.  But he deserves much credit for presenting cogently a looming possibility for humanity and discussing it honestly and with foresight.  I was fascinated.
<br />
<br />Is is "luddite" (if anyone really knows the meaning of that word) to question what the outcome might be of letting the genie out of the bottle?  Is it alarmist to suggest that we might need to reconsider the consequences of progress?  For most Americans, it seems almost sacriligious to question the infallibility of technology, to say nothing of its ability to constantly improve our lives.  But is that necessarily so?  Can anyone really say that unleashing the power of the Atom was unequivocally good?  Do we really have better lives with nuclear weapons blossoming all over the planet like morning glories?  For me, the answer is no, and I applaud the attempt by Bill McKibbon to state his case.  Is he absolutely correct, maybe not.  Only time will tell.  But this is an important book because it poses questions and challenges our thinking on the subject of genertic engineering, nanotechnology and the kind of future we are heading toward.  The intensity of the reviews is a testament to that.  
<br />
<br />There are only a few voices out there discussing the possibilities awaiting us down the road.  Enough is well worth reading, it may shake you up, and it will provoke some much needed discussion on these subjects.

                    <span>Bill McKibben has written a thoroughly researched book that highlights what kind of developments are now taking place and are expected to take place in the fields of genetics, computer technology, and nanotechnology. He then argues that we should voluntarily put the brakes on this kind of research, when it comes to redefining what it means to be human.  McKibben seems genuinely frightened at what is on the horizon.
<br />
<br />And when I read some of the quotes from highly respected scientists, I'm frightened, too.  They seem to have tunnel vision when it comes to their research, just plowing ahead just because they can, without thinking too hard about consequences, intended or otherwise.
<br />
<br />But I have some problems with the book.  First, many of the developments that scientists think they can accomplish will be very difficult, if not impossible, and the fallout may or may not be as bad as McKibben suggests.  I can see no way to identify all genes connected with certain personality traits, for example, nor can I see that inserting those genes guarantee that you'll get the desired outcome (environment does play a role in a person's temperment, after all).
<br />
<br />Second, McKibben's arguments are spurious, at best, based on sort of a gut revulsion to some of this research.  I share his revulsion to many of these developments, but I also recognize that to convince most people, you can't just talk about something as squishy as meaning and expect them to give up what seems like a good thing.  His statement that things are good enough as they are is almost comical, when you think of all the times through history when people declared that everything that could be invented already has, or that a new technology was dangerous (people once thought riding on "fast-moving" trains -- 25 mph or so -- would result in death).  And thinking that everyone will voluntarily restrain himself from human-altering research is even more comical.  As I said, I don't disagree necessarily, but I'd like to have seen him argue more compellingly and offer more feasible solutions.
<br />
<br />Another problem I had was simply with the way the book was written.  Sentence fragments can be very effective, but when overused, they just become annoying.  Ditto for ellipses.  Comma splices are just inexcusable.  And let's not put quotation marks around technical terms, shall we?
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, I found the information on what scientists are doing and hope to accomplish fascinating (and yes, a little scary).  When scientists are speaking to "true believers" they make some statements that make me want to keep a very close eye on them.  And we should.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>So where to join the fray?  I'll just say what I think, I guess.  First of all, McKibben has written a highly informative and gripping book.  He provides a good overview of some of the developments actually occurring in biotech, robotics, and nanotech right now (well, within the last few years), and then proceeds to outline his viewpoint of opposition to the radically transformative effects of these technologies.  This is all well and good.  Though I'm not sure how I come down on these issues, I greatly appreciated his viewpoint and thought that he had some compelling arguments against the use, or at least reckless use, of these technologies.
<br />
<br />First of all, I do not think, as some other reviewers have stated, that his argument is Luddite or in any way antitechnological.  He wholeheartedly agrees with, or at least supports, the efforts of biotech researchers, doctors, and roboticists to advance and apply their technologies in ways that do not radically alter the existential landscape.  Where he gets nervous is when people start talking about modifying who we are on an extremely basic level.  Try as one might, the discoveries of Galileo, Columbus, Einstein, and Bohr cannot be compared to germline engineering and nanotech.  These were revelations of the external landscape, knowledge revolutions.  The territory McKibben is trying to protect is the internal landscape.  
<br />
<br />Living to be 200 (or 500+), selecting from a catalog of gene upgrades for an unborn child, or becoming host to a swarm of nanomachines that act as immune system kevlar sounds pretty cool on paper, but his contention is that these technologies will ultimately dehumanize by making one of our last givens--our selves--into yet another commodity.  Once committed to these technologies, we'll be locked in, forced to get the next upgrade every time there's a new advance (every few years?), forced to keep feeding the hungry corporate behemoths to keep ourselves tuned up.  If not, we risk becoming obsolete and disconnected from the world we have allowed to come into being, not just economically or politically, as is the case with the disenfranchised now, but existentially, at our root level of being.  If we don't get our kids genetic upgrades, they or their descendents will become second-, third-, or fourth-class human beings, forever relegated to the trashbin of history.  And the poor may not even get the choice to procure gene upgrades or nanotech defenders, with the rich giving themselves a carte blanche to write their good fortune into the DNA of their descendants so that the advantages of "good blood" become literal.
<br />
<br />Decide for yourselves whether this argument and his others are convincing, or whether the technologies he discusses are dangerous for some other reason.  Nanotech and genefixing may make us so prosperous that everyone, all over the world, will become a golden god and begin living a life of ease.  Perhaps history is not an accurate precedent when dealing with something so transformative. But even if you are a fervent supporter of gene manipulation or nanotech, you should read the book.  Whether it's for the best or no, I do think McKibben is correct in saying that this is the only chance we have to say no.  The genie in the bottle is making all sorts of promises, trying to get us to let her/him/it out, and though they may all come true, it will be nigh impossible to get that genie back in if things aren't to our liking.
<br />
<br />McKibben wants us to say enough.  I'm not quite convinced, but he has convinced me that we should step back, as a society, and look long and hard at this technology before we say OK to anything that is going to change who we are.  I see nothing in our society to convince me that any of us have more than an extremely dim and immature understanding of who or what we are and are capable of right now, pre-germline engineering.  Maybe we should spend some more time understanding ourselves before we pass judgment on "stupid," "limited" man and start trying to upgrade.</span>

                    <span>The only thing new about this book is the author and the printing date.  Its premise is as old as recorded history.  "Man dare not venture into some areas or he risks waking the demon, being eaten by the sea monster, incurring the wrath of the gods, creating the Frankenstein monster, etc."<p>First of all, these dire predictions seldom (if ever) come to pass. Nuclear power is an excellent example.  In spite of the dire warnings and gloomy scenarios, some how we've managed to avoid annihilation (I can hear the collective "well, not yet" issuing from the Naderites), much to the chagrin of doom-prophets like McKibben, I'm sure.  We seem to manage to stay alive and even prosper whatever technologies we happen develop.  <p>Most importantly, McKibben's proposal that we ban, cease, outlaw, restrict, move backwards, whatever, is untenable.  You cannot stop people from eventually exploring these areas.  The technologies will be developed.  Pass all the laws you want.  Set up all the inquisitions you can muster.  Burn all the heretics you can round up.  The Bible will still be translated into English.  The printing press will still disseminate information to the masses.  The world will still revolve around the sun, not vice versa.  Even though God didn't give man wings he can still fly.  The automobile will replace the horse.  It will still be possible to exceed the speed of sound.  Man will still be descended from lower life forms, and on and on.  <p>McKibben challenges us to face the "fact" that things are as good as we need them to be.  He asks us to imagine how life could actually be any better and believes that we must admit that we can't.  Well, horse hockey!  Ask someone at the end of the 19th century the same question and they would probably not be able to imagine the world we live in.  They would probably have agreed with the statement, "Life can't get any better than it is right now."  Point is we can't know what all this will mean for the future of mankind.  I, for one, am not willing to abandon possibilities based on the fear mongering of a twenty-first century naysayer.  <p>As for his argument that all this is somehow dehumanizing, nothing is more human than improving who we are and how we live.  That is exactly how we've survived for the past 3.5 million years.  Sorry Bill, but you can take your place with the old wives and leave the rest of us alone.<p>I'm glad McKibben has the ability to say what he says.  He needs to thank technological advancement for the opportunity.  Other wise, he'd still be plowing a field to put bread on the table instead of cashing a check and going to the store.  This book is one of the best examples of cultural lag that I've seen lately.  The sad thing is that so many agree with the premise out of ignorance and fear.  But, that too has had it evolutionary advantages.  Fortunately, it's always been the progressives that adapted and survived.  Sorry Bill, I think you're headed for extinction.</span>

                    <span>The book is a discussion of McKibben's opinions of genetic manipulation of humans, the history of stem cell and cloning research and the possible outcomes. It is not a scientific work, but succeeds as a discussion in bioethics.<br>The book would be very useful for those who are unfamiliar with the subject and those who are only beginning to study bioethics. Some of the information seems too superficial for me, since I am a Family Physician studying for a Master's in Bioethics. I still learned new information and am definitely informed by the author's viewpoint.<br>I disagree with some of his pessimism about the reaction of the subjects of genetic manipulation since all children have struggled with identity and we've done fairly well so far. However, Dr Leon Kass and other more informed minds agree with McKibben. (I wonder how much of our differing opinions and optimism/pessimism are due to *our* genetics and how much due to that very struggle? How much is nature, how much nurture and the specific portion of our environment that includes these discussions?)</span>
