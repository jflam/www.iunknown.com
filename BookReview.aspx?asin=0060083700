                <span id="Label1"><blockquote> For award-winning interior designer Mariette Himes Gomez, every project is a voyage of self-discovery </blockquote> <p> Refined simplicity, thoughtful attention to detail, and a clear architectural design -- these are the hallmarks of Mariette's style. Filled with breathtaking photography, <i>Rooms</i> is a guided tour of the designs that have made Mariette one of the most respected and sought-after tastemasters in the country. Peek behind the scenes as she divulges the secrets of the trade that will help you transform your own home from the everyday to the extraordinary. </p> <p> Designing a room involves balancing the ideal and the real, discovering a happy medium between what you imagine and what exists. From evaluating the core architectural structure -- or "shell" -- of a room, to selecting colors and arranging furniture, to picking out and placing the final artistic touches, Mariette shares all of the techniques and information you'll need to create <i>Rooms</i> of elegance and distinction. </p> <p> What colors and patterns will work with a room's architecture? How can you visually turn two <i>Rooms</i> into one -- and vice versa? How is art different from d&#233;cor? How big a sofa will a room tolerate? Mariette answers these questions and more with sage advice and an easy-to-follow, step-by-step approach. She shares the experience of renovating her own homes -- one, a house in the country, the other, an apartment in the city -- and the many homes around the country that bear her unique signature. </p> <p> Whether you are decorating a loft apartment, summer cottage, or home in the suburbs, <i>Rooms</i> will help you strike the balance between beautiful and practical, lavish and livable. </p></span>

                    <span>As I thumbed through nine years of back issues of 'Architectural Digest this year, I was re captivated by the photos of particular homes. They were always interiors designed by Mariette Himes Gomez. I ordered 'Rooms' by Gomez and am thrilled with the book! I by no means have a pocket book like Mariette Himes Gomez or her clients, but can put many of her interior design methods to use now, thanks to her book. I love how she transforms a room into an atmosphere that is an art in itself. She shares her incredible talent in a book that is a pleasure to read. Since reading 'Rooms', I've rearranged furniture, paired art and accessorized table tops without struggling anymore. Her discussion on lighting helped my husband and I make the move to track lights that don't detract from the light fixtures we enjoy for their craftsmanship. 'Rooms' is a book I'll refer to as I tackle future interior design improvement projects in our home. Thank you, Mariette Himes Gomez for a luxurious book with practical design concepts.</span>

                    <span>This book presents a lot of great information on how to put together comfortable spaces that look good. I am surprised at the negative reviews and can only assume that the readers were looking for inpirational picutres of colorful rooms and not practical advice on decorating. I own many decorating books but this is the first one that I read cover to cover because it tells you how to place furniture, design lighting, clean up the shell of the space. . . all those practical details that other books usually ignore. My style is more eclectic and colorful than the author but I certainly think that this book will help me translate it into rooms that will be comfortable for everyone.</span>

                    <span>This book is trully inspiring. These rooms are both elegant and comfortable. If you like neutral tones, dark woods, moldings, etc. this book is for you. If you can't go a day without watching Trading Spaces because you actually like the shocking mix of colors (orange, lime greens, etc.), this book is not for you! <P>Although some people might say that they could never afford to design rooms like these, that's just not true. Use your creativity and shop around. Maybe your room doesn't have the architectural details that some of these rooms have, so what?!? Add a little molding, use the same color schemes, and don't forget to use some imagination...</span>

                    <span>This is the first design book I have read that has reflected my true beliefs in the serenity and geometry of good design.It maps the process of Mariette Himes Gomez designed interiors. It is written to be read by anyone and is well illustrated. Good design practices to be learned by all and not just the affluent. She not only simplifies good design with a step by step approach, but it is written so that you will enjoy reading, you don't have to be a designer to interpret what she is saying.</span>

                    <span>The rooms in this book are boring, depressing, and not comfortable looking. As a newcomer to the decorating book world (I'm looking at lots of books as I work on my home), I am learning to beware of words such as "luxurious," or "taste," or "elegance" which may indicate that some author or designer is about to tell me how I should live. As I went through this book I saw that this author's idea of "luxury" is very formal and stiff which (to me) is not "luxurious" at all. Luxury (to me) means being able to relax completely in my home. Unfortunately, this author doesn't get that and has filled this book with overly formal, overly fussy, overly traditional and therefore uncomfortable rooms. I can't imagine who would really want to live this way.</span>
