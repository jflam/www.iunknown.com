                    <span>I have spent many years working in the trenches gathering system requirements, working on process improvement projects, and designing business organizations.  Although there are many good books on the subject of process and workflow documentation and design, none that I've read are as practical as this.  There exists in this book a complete blueprint for facilitating productive discussions that will help you figure out precisely what your objective should be, and take you step by step through the process of scope setting, understanding the status quo, and designing a future state.  This book also helps bridge between the world of human users and IT systems, demonstrating one way to produce documents that can be a useful start for application design activities.
<br />
<br />A couple of areas where the book falls short, though, is that the organization of the book itself is a little fragmented--causing me to guess that the reader could pretty accurately see where the co-authors divided the writing tasks.  Don't be discouraged because of this, because the information is in the book, it just might take a couple of reads and some review to put it together the first time you try to use it.  The other mild criticism I have is that the book touches on some aspects of IT design, namely use cases and ERDs, but doesn't do a great job of showing the reader how to achieve meaningful results with those tools in particular.  I point these negatives out to be fair, but BUY THE BOOK while it's available, because it's useful and will always be on your bookshelf.  </span>

                    <span>To me, the chapters on data modeling and use case modeling are the most valuable because I now see them in the context of process modeling. I am wondering if W. H. Inmon's book on the operational data store would help complete this "big picture." Readers of this book benefit from the very extensive experiences of the authors. The authors have seen it all and warn readers which roads are dead ends.  This book includes both theory and prescriptions as to how teams can design and document processes and contribute to the alignment of technology with the needs of the organization.</span>

                    <span>This book nicely sets forth a detailed methodology for doing swimlane diagramming for workflow business processing. This book is for analysts; the discussion is about the nature of business processes that have workflow as a key characteristic. It is not about the architecture of computer solutions for such processes. If you follow the methodology in this book and flesh out the diagrams with use cases (just briefly touched on here), you will have captured most of the requirements for a business workflow process.<p>The book is nicely bound and well written. The authors have been around a while and the vocabulary and approach fit nicely with older concepts like business process reengineering. The authors are not unaware of the latest developments and "UML" crops up  here and there but not in the index. The diagramming is very simple compared to UML activity diagrams.<p>This is good reading for the domain experts on a team working on the requirements document and a nice primer for geeks who are forced for the first time to talk to the business side of an enterprise.</span>

                    <span>Rarely do I get excited about books on workflow modeling.  I have a few good books on the subject, all of which provide solid approaches and most of which are well written.  This book stands out because it goes beyond merely "solid" or "well written" by giving one of the most comprehensive approaches to workflow modeling I've had the pleasure of reading.  <p>First, like most books on the topic, none of the components of the approach are new.  What makes the approach refreshing is the way the authors take standard techniques and tie them together into a coherent process.  Second, this book can be used as a workbook during a workflow modeling project, and is well suited to this because of the numerous checklists and diagrams that will prove invaluable every step of the way.  Finally, this is the first book of its kind that incorporates use cases, making it invaluable to project teams that have standardized on UML (Unified Modeling Language)or wish to integrate an object-oriented approach into a workflow modeling project.  If you're not familiar with use cases I strongly recommend Writing Effective Use Cases by Alistar Cockburn (the best book on the subject in my opinion); UML Distilled by Fowler and Scott is an excellent introduction to that subject if it's new to you.<p>The approach is straightforward:  frame the process and define its scope, understand the existing process (if there is one), design the "to-be" process and develop use case scenarios.  I wish to offer one caveat at this point:  if you are reengineering a process that is seriously broken you might consider skipping the "as-is" process.  Understanding the existing process is useful if your goal is incremental improvement.  Reengineering efforts usually radically transform existing processes, making efforts to understand them both moot and wasted.<p>Some of the highlights of this book include the authors' clear definitions and way of decomposing complex systems into discrete steps and components. For example, they use a five tier view of processes that ensures you have a complete view of all issues and factors.  The views are: (1) mission, strategy and goals (I personally extend goals further into Goal-Question-Metric), (2)business processes, (3) presentation, (4) application logic and (5) data.  Note that the last three align nicely to a 3-tier client/server architecture.  This observation clearly shows how coherent the authors' approach is and how it can foster alignment of technology to business requirements.<p>I also like how the authors clarify the key issues in process design by pointing out six enablers that you need to account for during the analysis and design phase: (1)workflow, (2) technology, (3) human resources, (4) motivations and measurements, (5) policies and rules and (6) environmental constraints (facilities, external process capabilities, etc.). There is one minor point of disagreement I have between their workflow modeling technique and the one I use.  The authors use swimlane diagrams (also called Rummler-Brache diagrams), while I use deployment diagrams.  The difference?  Swimlane diagrams do not capture phases or cycles.  I always place workflows into the context of Entry Criteria-Task-Validation-Exit Criteria (ETVX), which is nearly identical to the TQM Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.  I insist on ETVX because it allows me to spot missing validation points in an existing workflow, and ensures that I clearly define entry and exit criteria, as well as validation points in a "to-be" workflow.  Of course I am stating personal preferences - following the authors' approach verbatim will definitely result in a workflow design that is not only "bulletproof", but will align information systems and business process almost perfectly.<p>This book is a gem.  It's readable, full of ideas and, with the incorporation of use cases into the approach, completely up-to-date with respect to IS/IT methodologies.  If you want a fresh, modern approach to workflow design this book is the only one that will provide it.</span>
