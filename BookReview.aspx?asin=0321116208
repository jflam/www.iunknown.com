                <span id="Label1">Everything changes in the Microsoft .NET Framework and the C# language, including the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). <I>Windows Forms Programming in C#</I> explains the Windows Forms (WinForms) environment to programmers who have some experience with .NET programming, and in the process (thanks to a clear and deliberate expository style) reveals a lot about .NET to less experienced developers. The overall effect is that almost every reader comes away with better knowledge of .NET, not just its user-interface libraries and behaviors. <p>  Author Chris Sells takes care to balance code samples with explanatory text, meaning that most chapters take on a characteristic "code, explanation, effect" style (in which "effect" is usually documented with a screen shot). This approach is effective, and serves both to answer "How do I..." questions and inspire "I should give that a try!" exploration. Once in a while, callouts will link two or more screen shots with a sample of code, graphically illustrating how code affects the appearance of a form and how it's represented in the Visual Studio development environment. On top of his clear teaching style, Sells calls attention to workarounds for shortcomings in the .NET environment (particularly where similar limitations don't exist in Microsoft Foundation Classes), helping to improve programmer productivity in the growing .NET environment. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use the WinForms environment within the Microsoft .NET Framework. Dialog boxes, drawing, printing, and controls all are covered by means of explanations and lots of illustrative examples, and there's good coverage of the WinForms event model, too. An appendix compares MFC and the .NET Framework.</span>

                    <span>Windows Forms Programming in C# doesn't disappoint.<P>The book quickly dives into the basics of form development, layout and resources. Even though the topic is somewhat introductory to someone who's done a lot of Windows Form development, the book is written in such a way that there was several times still found myself learning something new. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on drawing, there's always something interesting to be found when working with GDI+.<P>200 pages later, I found myself in a chapter that discusses a topic that you rarely see in any Windows programming book - Printing. This chapter is worth the price of the book alone to have it on your shelf as a reference guide. You won't find a more detailed coverage of printing anywhere else. <P>While I could go on and on about each individual chapter, I wanted to point out one that I particularly found helpful - Chapter 14 on Multithreaded User Interfaces. I had originally read part of this in an MSDN article, and was looking forward to the full content - and wasn't disappointed: Asynchronous operations, Safety and Multithreading, Callbacks (synchronous and asynchronous), etc. are all covered.<P>Anyways, I could go on and on - there are plenty of tasty .NET morsels in here to keep both the novice and experienced developer consumed with this book.</span>

                    <span>If you are currently, or aspire to be, a serious .NET developer, then buy this book. Buy it now. Do not hesitate. <P>After fully assimilating Francesco Balena's "Programming Visual Basic.NET" (coming from a VB6 background) and Jeff Prosise's "Programming .NET" (during my C# transition), both of which I feel are excellent books in a general coverage sense, and after wading through countless MSDN how-to's, whitepapers, and technical articles, I felt generally rounded in .NET development and what the framework has to offer. This book, however, fills in all the gaps and causes everything else to fuse together is a way that feels almost transcendent. <P>You will come away from it feeling an increased oneness with the .NET framework. You will feel like you have "insider" information on many topics that simply aren't covered adequately, if at all, in the MSDN material. You will have a much more complete understanding of all the various properties exposed by the intrinsic and third party controls in the designer and how to implement rich, professional grade, designer features in your own controls and components. <P>There simply isn't any doubt this book belongs on the shelf of anyone doing any kind of .NET development. The author's ability to so smoothly impart such a vast amount of knowledge in such a concise, readable, and enjoyable manner is truly wonderful. When they come out with the leather bound edition, I shall not hesitate to order another copy for proper placement next to Knuth, Petzold, and Douglas Adams.</span>

                    <span>I have purchased several WinForm books but this is the one I use most. Chris does a great job covering the basics while at the same time providing a great deal of advanced material. <P>Every topic covered is provided with code examples which makes it very easy to understand AND apply.<P>The only thing missing from the book is a complete sample application that draws everything together. But to be fair the book covers so much material such a sample application would probably be beyond the scope of the book.<P>If you are trying to decide on a winform book I highly recommend this book. Rest assured this book will help you get to the essence of .net winforms!<P>Even if you don't get the book, do some searches on Chris and you'll come up with a lot of great .net stuff!</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the finest technical books written. I'm not just saying that. I've read about half of it, and I can't tell you how many times I read something and thought "how would I use that" or "when would I use that feature/overload/option?" and found a clear example in the next sentence or paragraph explaining the differences or usefulness of that feature.<P>This book is in the Addison-Wesley .NET series, so it doesn't cover .NET from-the-ground-up, instead it explains every nook and cranny of Windows Forms applications. It is so packed with info that if you open the book to the middle, you realize that if the book were just half its length, it would cover a huge amount of information.<P>I learned as a technical writer in a seminar that by writing concisely and using whitespace and simple, effective illustrations, a writer should make it as easy for the reader to extract the information off the page as "pancakes coming off a hot griddle."  The reader shouldn't have to scrape with a spatula to get the point. I told a friend talking about this Winforms book that you can learn a lot just by looking at the illustrations while flipping through the pages. A hot griddle indeed.<P>To build Windows Forms applications with all the features of leading commercial software, you need this book. <P>The reason I gave it 5 stars out of 5? Because 6 stars was not offered me as a choice.</span>

His examples are concise and to the point and makes C# look simple and elegant. After reading the first few chapters I was very excited and I couldn't wait to get started on a project. Highly recommended.</span>
