                <span id="Label1">Written by a Microsoft insider and well-respected Visual Basic expert,  Matthew Curland's <I>Advanced Visual Basic 6: Power Techniques for Everyday  Programs</I> is a unique guide to extending the reach of VB into COM and object  design. This compendium of tips and strategies for doing more in VB is perfect  for intermediate to advanced developers who seek to overcome bottlenecks in  performance and functionality in their favorite programming tool.<p>  The underlying message is that VB lets you work more efficiently with Microsoft  COM if you implement a few extra routines that look under its hood. The more notable techniques use memory more efficiently (including code that  creates large numbers of objects faster). More advanced readers will appreciate  the in-depth guide to building COM objects programmatically within VB. (The book  shows you how to create lightweight COM objects by using custom routines.) For  the real guru, there's even a section on how to use inline assembly language  within VB. Later sections turn to a host of techniques for multithreading, doing  more with windows, and how to manage and customize COM-type libraries for  successful real-world deployment. Armed with these custom routines and an  expert's-eye view of VB internals, you'll be able to get more out of VB with  faster, more versatile programs. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B><ul><li>Tips and strategies for extending Visual Basic by  using COM <li>VB pointers and memory management <li>Extending VB arrays  (accessing underlying SAFEARRAY COM objects and speeding up array performance)  <li>Accessing the <I>IUnknown</I> COM interface from within VB <li>Binding names  and COM <I>vtables</I> in VB <li>Improving code reuse by using aggregation in VB  (overriding functions in child classes and simulating polymorphism)  <li>Improving object cleanup in VB (circular, weak, and strong references and  strategies for improving memory use in class hierarchies) <li>Using COM class  factory APIs within VB <li>Loading DLLs and OCX controls directly  <li>Lightweight COM objects in VB <li>Strategies for creating large numbers of  objects efficiently <li>Accessing the VB Running Object Table (ROT) <li>Calling  function pointers in VB <li>Simulating inline assembly instructions <li>Threads  in VB (apartment models, worker and UI threads, and synchronization tips)  <li>Improving VB performance with strings <li>Generating and customizing type  libraries<li>Binary compatibility of COM objects <li>Tips for working with  windows in VB (subclassing, custom window creation, and windowless controls)  <li><I>VBoost</I> (custom library of advanced VB routines)</ul></span>

                    <span>This book even surpasses the possibilities of McKinley's "Hardcore Visual Basic". You almost gain the power of C/C++ type Windows and COM programming.<BR>This book is not easy to read. You do need a C level expertise on Windows' and COM's inner working. Though no ATL or MFC is required. <BR>I did learn a lot of the apparently strange behavior of VB. It is now clearer to me. But should you really apply those grandiose tricks. (For proper clean up purposes you should not hit the stop button anymore.) The answer is the same as for optimization. Don't do it! But if I am really in need? Don't do it! ... After at least ten iterations including solid peer review you might try it. The author makes it pretty easy. The book has a CD with an excellent and well modularized library and lots of example code. <BR>Is this book still relevant after the advent of VS.Net? I think so yes. It is an intellectual joy to read this book. (Why couldn't I read it 1996?) We and many other institutions still write a lot of code in VB 6. Anyhow this probably was my last book on VB 6.</span>

                    <span>A most well-written book with (for this programmer) some structural problems that do not diminish its technical value as an aid to deeper understanding of the "machinery" behind the "user illusion" of Visual Basic.<P>This book requires a type of deep knowledge about COM and the underlying interface between Visual Basic and the Windows 32 operating system which you will probably not have unless you have been a C/C++ programmer ... or have done extensive work with trying to optimize applications writen in VB using the API interfaces to Windows provided by VB.<P>It offers very complex solutions to very complex problems. Implementing the solutions requires you to depend upon the author's provided bridging-code ... a package called "VBBoost" ... which, for most mortals, will be a set of "black boxes."<P>The problem with that is that as soon as Windows and VB change ... and they soon will undergo a most profound transformation when .Net and VB7 arrive ... how will any real-world solution implemented using the author's bridging-code tools be reliably maintainable ? Or even be usable in the radically different architecture ?<P>Personally, I would not dare use the tools provided by the author ... which he will update and maintain on his web-site as he has time ... for any commercial code. For me there is difficulty with the MS provided controls whose quirks require staying on top of so many Knowledge Base articles, and which often have to be extended through API code to really tap their full functionality.<P>To use the techniques in this book with confidence I would have to spend more time than I wish to going back and learning the depths of COM and Win32 ... and I'd just about have to do that by studying the C/C++ literature ... which I'd then have to mentally translate back to VB.<P>This would undoubtedly make me a better programmer through sleep deprivation, but it is not consistent with my use of VB for rapid prototyping and application development at a fairly high level of abstraction.<P>If you are a VB Guru already ... or are really ready to step out of the "VB Bubble" into the depths of COM and Win32 ... then I think ... as the other reviews attest ... this is THE book for you. The author, imho, has a genius for explaining very complex interactions between the different internal layers of software in Windows.<P>I do not regret buying this book, and I really enjoyed the author's clear, expository, style. To me he writes as cleanly and enjoyably as Francesco Balena, Karl Peterson, and a very few others about such a deeply technical aspect of VB.<P>His web site with updates to the software examples and revisions and corrections for the book shows he is committed to helping people use his work.<P>So, in conclusion, I have to say that while I wish I was at the level where I could understand and use the knowledge presented so well in this book, I am not.<P>I have mixed feelings about writing this review ... as I do about the book; I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from buying this book which is an important contribution to the "distaff" VB literature (a universe until now mainly populated by Appleman and McKinney).<P>What I would love to see would be a book by Francesco Balena, my favorite VB author, that would somehow get me to the point where I could grok Curland's book without spending a year in the C/C+/API gulag. But perhaps Francesco has better uses of his time :)<P>Please do check out this book yourself !<P>Bill Woodruff, dotScience</span>

Everything that you always wanted to do in VB - and it's here! It's an ABSOLUTE must for any serious programmer.<P>This book is on the same level of every VB programmers bible - Dan Appleman's Guide to the Win32 API - if that gives you an idea of how good it is.<P>I can't believe I haven't heard about this book before.</span>

                    <span>The title does not lie, this is a very advanced Visual Basic 6.0 book. When I was studying for the 2 Visual Basic 6.0 certification exams (which I passed with flying colors), this book provided me with advanced features of Visual Basic. Although the book is not really a reference book, the more experienced or advanced developer will find useful solutions in this book. I highly recommend this book for those experienced developers. This book should not be read by developers who are trying to learn Visual Basic because the subjects discussed in this book may confuse them.</span>

                    <span>This book came to me so highly recommended by people I truly respect, but as a developer whose job it is to deliver software solutions on time and within budget, it's hardly useful at all.<P>The folks who touted this book so highly to me are all C programmers who seem to view VB as a necessary evil for occasional RAD projects, but I'm not in that school of thought.<P>The real title of this book should have been "How to Trick VB into behaving more like C by writing code that's just as excruciating." Sure, you can do that, but then you miss the main advantage of VB over C, namely the capability to deliver maintainable software to your client in a fraction of the time (and cost) it would take for some oh-so-perfect system to be written in C.<P>Save this for the super hard-core projects that can't be handled any other way. And while you're at it, if you're going to keep things so complicated, you might as well just write in C.</span>
