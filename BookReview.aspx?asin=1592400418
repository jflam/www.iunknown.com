                    <span>I don't have anything to add to the positive reviews that have already been posted. Suffice it to say that this book lives up to its promise. I have been buying lots of book on fashion, but this is the book I refer to over and over. Whatever your personal style--trendy, romantic, classic, sexy--this book is pertinent for you. This is a refreshing change from other books, which I feel try to steer you toward one basic style or another. Farr gives you basic principles so that you can choose tasteful, flattering clothes no matter what your preference. I could see a teenager using this book or a senior citizen! <P>I now understand how celebrities look so good in their clothes. Her writing is clear and to the point, and specific without being confining.</span>

                    <span>Like many of my girlfriends, I have always found the world of fashion to be a rather exclusive club to which I've somehow be denied membership. Thank you so much Kendall Farr for being a kind, wise and very funny friend! Reading Ms Farr's book is like be taken by the hand by a generous insider and led gently but confidently into a new world where I can at last have a comfortable bra, pants that fit, clothes that flatter and I don't have to feel like a loser for hating thong underwear! Style CAN be for every woman. If you want to look and feel better in your clothes, read this book!</span>

                    <span>Farr zeroes in on what's probably the most important truth in fashion: Understand your silhouette and which shapes flatter it, and the rest is really pretty easy. I've bought several books on fashion, but this is probably the best. If you buy this book and back it up with one of Leah Feldon's, you're covered!</span>

                    <span>The Pocket Stylist is one of the few fashion books I've found that lives up to its promise. It steers clear of the personal and lifestyle advice usually offered under the guise of fashion and provides a thorough guide to the little things that make you look better.<P>Ms. Farr offers simple clothing and makeup advice, but the real (and perhaps fleeting) strength of this book is its wealth of wardrobe care and planning resources. She names names and provides phone numbers. <P>This is not a glamorous book- despite its chic little illustrations. But its tips are the underpinning that can keep you looking elegant yourself.</span>
