                <span id="Label1"><p>In her bestselling classic <i>The Courage to Heal,</i> Laura Davis helped millions heal from the pain of child sexual abuse. Now, in <i>I Thought We'd Never Speak Again,</i> she tackles another critical, emerging issue: reconciling relationships that have been damaged by betrayal, anger, and misunderstanding.</p> <p>With clarity and compassion, Davis maps the reconciliation process through gripping first-person stories of people who have mended relationships in a wide variety of circumstances. In these pages, parents reconcile with children, embittered siblings reconnect, angry friends reunite, and war veterans and crime victims meet with their enemies. Davis weaves these powerful accounts with her own experiences reconciling with her mother after a long, painful estrangement.</p> <p>Making a crucial distinction between reconciliation and forgiveness, Davis explains how people can make peace in relationships without necessarily forgiving past hurts. In addition to a special section called "Ideas for Reflection and Discussion," she includes a self-assessment quiz, "Are You Ready for Reconciliation?"</p> <p>Whether you want to reconcile a relationship that has ended, improve a relationship that is difficult or distant, or learn the skills you need for dealing with the inevitable conflicts we all face in life, this book will teach you to mend troubled relationships and find peace.</p></span>

                    <span>This book has rocked my world. I literally have a different life after having read it. It has led me to take giant steps toward multiple personal reconciliations that have held me hostage for years, while also giving me a sense of collective purpose-- the significance of this kind of work toward a vision of reconciliation on a global scale can not be underestimated..<P>Am I the 100th monkey? All I can tell you is that from these pages came real changes . The stories evoked alot of head nodding and tears, with my own stories of estrangement suddenly having a tangible context within which to flourish and take heart... Maybe it was the great empathy with which it was written, or the detailed way in which Ms Davis is able to take us down that jungle path into the contrary ways of the heart ...these things followed by stories of those doing the good work of reconciling entire classes of people in political or religious conflict made for one very moved, well fed, and lately enlightened monkey.</span>

                    <span>Laura Davis has done a very brave and spritual thing in writing this much-needed book which exposes the virtues of healing the deep-seated rifts that occur between human beings. Written simply and clearly, I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER SPEAK AGAIN offers relevant examples of how others have managed to reconciliate, ranging from families that reach out to one another after years of heartbreaking estrangement to Palestineans and Israelies who manage to find understanding.<P>In focusing on the benefits of healing relationships, Davis offers welcome alternatives for those mired down in anger and antagonism. She provides hope for those seeking an end to heartbreaking separation from loved ones and offers practical advice on how to go about initiating reconciliation.<P>This book is even more meaningful in view of the fact that in it Davis has come full circle from her previous stance in A COURAGE TO HEAL, which encouraged taking a hard line and breaking up families, a road Davis traveled in her own life. She is to be commended for the great courage and maturity she has shown in embracing reconciliation and healing the relationships in her own family and for seeking to help others do so.<P>This is a must-read for anyone who has experienced the tragedy of severed relationships.</span>

                    <span>Unlike many other books, you may want to start by reading the appendices. If you open to Appendix A, you will start with an excellent questionnaire that will help you to know if you are ready for reconcilliation. You also may use information in the appendices to get a FREE reconcilliation newsletter. There also is help in deciding whether to seek psychotherapy and how to form a discussion group.<P>The body of the book uses one of the most effective tools known to self-improvement. It reports in-depth interviews with real people who have experienced different kinds of reconcilliation, from minor improvements to incredible breakthroughs. If it is your intention to reconcile yourself to another, it is very likely that these experiential stories will strike a receptive chord in you. This may well help you to find new inner resources to find the new peace and tranquility that you yearn for.<P>If you have a problem involving reconcilliation, this is the book for you.<P>Peter Bloch<BR>...</span>
