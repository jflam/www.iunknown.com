                <span id="Label1">Aimed at advanced C++ developers who want to hone their programming chops even further, Herb Sutter's <I>More Exceptional C++</I> borrows the format of his earlier title, <I>Exceptional C++</I>, and delivers some of today's best-available thinking on the language in a handy and effective format. A compilation of the author's own experience and research on the thornier aspects of C++, this book will serve as a worthy resource for making sure you get the most out of this powerful language.<p>  The concise text covers a range of challenging topics in C++ without attempting to be comprehensive. Each "item" is presented as a question to try and solve yourself before the author presents his solution, plus additional detail as needed. For most topics, Sutter ends by giving his advice on the best practices (and gotchas to avoid).<p>  Early sections concentrate on using Standard Template Library (STL) container classes, like removing items effectively, and the subtle differences between container types. Standout sections on designing custom templates (using specialization techniques) and exception-safe classes will help you do more with your own classes. One entertaining problem here shows a number-guessing game (Mastermind) built as efficiently as possible using STL code (including expert-level use of generic functions to do much of the work).<p>  Several problems on copy-on-write (COW) semantics for more efficient classes point out the issues surrounding code optimization. (The author argues against a simplistic approach to optimizing code, including an overreliance on <I>inlining</I> functions. Several times he points out the difficulty of getting COW code to work in multithreaded projects.)<p>  There has been a debate in the C++ community for years about whether it's possible to design truly "exception-safe" classes. Sutter points out the difficulty with a precise analysis of the issues surrounding exceptions and C++ constructors. Material on the finer points of inheriting classes (including when to avoid and when to use multiple inheritance in C++) will extend your class design options. A good section here is the author's explication of how to simulate COM/Java style interfaces in C++, which isn't immediately obvious, even to experienced C++ developers.<p>  Later sections delve into code maintenance issues, including advice for using macros, <I>typedefs</I>, and namespaces. (Advice on migrating existing C++ code into namespaces will help you combine legacy code with other libraries.) A final appendix shows off some benchmarks for optimizing strings using a variety of techniques.<p>  Intelligent, provocative, and demanding, <I>More Exceptional C++</I> shows why C++ continues to be a rich, complex, and challenging language. Armed with titles like this one, experienced C++ programmers can write better code and avoid pitfalls buried in the outer edges of their favorite language. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Puzzles and solutions to advanced topics in C++, using <I>remove()</I> and <I>erase()</I> for Standard Template Library (STL) containers, custom templates with inheritance and traits, using <I>typename</I>, containers used with pointers, the finer points of <I>vector</I>, <I>set</I>, and <I>maps</I>, potential problems with <I>vector < bool ></I>, post and prefix operators used with functions, templates overloading, explicit and partial template specialization (plus function template overloading), using STL to implement Mastermind (a number-guessing game), the finer points of <I>inline</I> functions, lazy optimizations (including copy-on-write--COW--and semantics for strings), iterators and references, gotchas in multithreaded environments, designing exception-safe classes, constructor failures and object lifetimes, uncaught exceptions (the pitfalls of using <I>uncaught_exception()</I>), unmanaged pointers (in parameter evaluation and <I>auto_ptr</I>); copy assignment, inheritance and exception safety issues, multiple inheritance dos and don'ts, the Siamese Twin problem, virtual functions, controlled polymorphism, memory management issues with smart pointers (<I>auto_ptr</I>), recursive declarations, how to simulate nested functions, preprocessor macros, hints for initialization, forward declarations, using <I>typedef</I> effectively, best practices for namespaces (including code maintenance and migrating existing C++ code to namespaces), and appendices on advice for multithreaded optimization.</span>

                    <span>I read this book after reading Effective C++ by Scott Meyers. Being able to discuss specific topics rather than viewing a language as a whole was my preferred way of understanding C++, so the books by Sutter and Meyers fit me perfectly.<P>The main advantage the Exceptional C++ series has over the Meyers series is that you can tell Sutter is the better programmer. You can trust that everything Meyers says is correct but in the end all you really get is some extra pointers on how to do certain things. Sutter on the other hand gets a little deeper on the same topics and makes you feel like can write better C++ code, rather than just being able to format it better.<P>One complaint I had about Effective C++ by Meyers was that most of the book is text and contains very little code. My experience with reading programming books is that around 90% of plain text will not be retained. The only way verbal programming text will ever stick is if there is good code to accompany it. Since Sutter is a programmer first, author second, he provides more code examples and they seem to be more thought out.<P>If you have the time then you should probably read from both authors, however, if you don't want to read 4 books then you should probably read the Exceptional series over the Effective series.</span>

                    <span>In this book Herb Sutter continues investigating of the problems that face C++ developers. Even discussions of the problems that one is unlikely to confront reveal important aspects of the proper C++ programming.<P>The author often beats on a problem until it "has ceased to be ... expired and gone ... bereft of life ... rests in peace" (p. 118). In this particular book, most of the time this is a good thing, because in software development almost everything is a tradeoff, and you don't want to open the gates of hell as a side effect of plugging up a little hole.<P>I have enjoyed reading this book at least as much as its predecessor, "Exceptional C++". Unfortunately on occasion the author spends too much time discussing trivial implications that appear not to be in line with the complexity of other topics. Also, constant restatement of the parts of every problem statement is quite wasteful and distracting, especially considering the amount of space they occupy (sometimes 25% of the solution space!)</span>

                    <span>This book, like the earlier one by Sutter, was a reality check for me. Before I read it, I blissfully believed that I knew C++ really well. After all, I have taught it at the college and corporate level for ten years and programmed commercial code for three. I have also written and published material about the language in several journals. However, these forty exercises really opened my eyes and exercised my brain. They are excellent teaching material, showing you aspects of the language that are subtle, yet critical to know. <BR> One topic that I experienced firsthand is when an exception is thrown out of a constructor. This happened to me many years ago, and I spent hours trying to correct the code so that it finally did something similar to what I wanted. Had I been able to read items 17 and 18 of this book, I could have cut that to about twenty minutes and kept more of my hair.<BR> The problems are all typical of those encountered in the "unusual average" day in the life of a C++ programmer. By that I mean that they may not necessarily reflect the day to day work, but are general enough to most likely crop up on some day for everyone who writes code in C++. The general categories are:<P>1) Generic programming and the C++ standard library<BR>2) Optimization and Performance<BR>3) Exception safety issues and techniques<BR>4) Inheritance and polymorphism<BR>5) Memory and resource management<BR>6) Free functions and macros<BR>7) Miscellaneous topics<P> There are many things going on behind the scenes in your C++ programs that most of the time you can ignore. However, when it is a time that you can't, then Sutter is one of the people to consult. His material is always well written and useful in the real world and I recommend this book to all my corporate clients.</span>

                    <span>Herb sutter's first book worth it's name : it was exceptional. That's why it was a challenge to write an equally good one as a second book. Of course, Herb put a lot of it's main ideas into his first book (like the "swap guts idiom" for example), but it leaves a big room for side subjects.<BR>Topics in this volume are well classified, maybe better than in the first volume. They adress important subjects for the C++ day to day programmer : standard library, performances, exception safety, resource management, etc... The "engineering puzzles" are in fact much less important than the "solution" described bellow. Because each of the solution is not mid game but a practicle piece of work that leads you to a better C++ quality code.<BR>Honestly, this book is not for beginner. It's much more valuable to read a primer book (stroustrup's C++ programing language, or better the Lipman's C++ primer) and then Meyer's effective C++. At least. You also should have a couple of year of C++ practice behind your belt (also at least). It's a top level C++ book, with top level advices and a top level payback for you.<BR>After reading this volume, I have a stong impression that next Sutter's book will stay with such level of quality. Great work, Herb, thank you !<BR>A last word : Maybe you are surprised I've not given 5 stars to this book ? Well I reserve such notation for strongly exceptional book, like the "design patterns". 4 stars still be very good on my own scale.</span>
