                <span id="Label1">Cheating, argues author David Callahan, is no longer the exclusive purview of lowlife criminals, slick hucksters, and shady characters with ace cards shoved in secretive places. Now everyone's doing it and because everyone sees everyone else doing it, they keep on doing it. Callahan says the trouble begins in America's brutally competitive economic climate, which rewards results and looks the other way when it comes to the ethical and even criminal transgressions of those who come out on the winning end. Certainly there is no shortage of examples of cheating from the business community, and Callahan nimbly dissects the dishonest actions of the usual suspects (Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing) to demonstrate how that same mentality extends out to our educational system, amateur and professional sports, the news media, and even the lives of common citizens who, while they would never think of themselves as being cheaters, are nevertheless inclined to commit the occasional act of beneficial fudging. And while honesty is a nice ideal, Callahan says that cheaters cheat because, contrary to oft-repeated axioms, cheaters win: the chances of being caught are shrinking as are the punishments meted out should one be nabbed, and the benefits of a successful cheat far outstrip any potential threat. Further, Callahan posits that otherwise upright folks who would not cheat are drawn into the practice out of fear that they simply won't be able to make it in modern society otherwise. There's a lot of material for Callahan to work with here, given that every instance of cheating is fair game as source material and is able to be used to construct a theory of epidemic. And the range of material is so broad and the basic argument ("we cheat more") so simple that <I>The Cheating Culture</I> feels a bit like a Newsweek trend piece writ extremely large. Still, it must be noted that Callahan really had all that material to work with and that fact alone is compelling evidence that his premise is dead on. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>You might imagine this book would just be hand-wringing about the decline in honesty.  Not at all.  Callahan explains WHY people cheat, and hence what you can do practically to encourage them not to.

                    <span>While David Callahan presents a number of ideas about both cheating behavior and its consequences, his book is rather light on actual research to back up his theories.  As I read the book, I kept waiting for him to support his ideas with facts, and in the end was disappointed to find that he never did so.  
<br />
<br />Without facts, this book is little more than a moralistic rant, albeit a well-written one.  This book will offer cheaters a salve for their concious (everyone does it, I need to cheat to get ahead, society has enabled me to cheat, etc.) and non-cheaters a number of stories to fuel their righteous anger.  If you want to get upset about cheating, it is a good read.  If you want to draw a fact-based conclusion about the prevelance and consequences of cheating in modern society, look elsewhere.</span>

<br />
<br />I recommend that this book be read together with John Perkins, "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man," and William Greider's, "The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy."  As a pre-amble, I would note that a Nobel Prize was given in the late 1990's to a man that demonstrates that trust lowers the cost of doing business.  Morality matters--immorality imposes a pervasive sustained, insidious, long-term, and ultimately fatal cost on any community, any Republic, and that is the core message of this book that most reviewers seem to be missing.
<br />
<br />Any student of national security can tell you that one of the most important sources of national power is the population, followed by the economy, natural resources, and then the more traditional sources of national power: diplomacy, military, law enforcement, and government policies generally.
<br />
<br />What this author makes clear is that our population has become a cheating population, one that cheats in school, cheats their employer, and cheats their clients (lawyers, accountants, doctors, all cheating).  Such a population is literally undermining national security by creating false values, and undermining true values.  Some simple examples: an estimated $250 Billion a year in individual tax avoidance; an estimated $600 Billion a year in theft from employers; an estimated $250 Billion a year in legalized corporate tax avoidance and investor fraud; and an additional $250 Billion a year in legalized theft form the individual taxpayers through Congressional support for unnecessary and ill-advised "subsidies" for agriculture, fishing, and forestry, as well as waivers of environmental standards that ultimately result in long-term external diseconomies...
<br />
<br />At root, the author observes that pervasive cheating ensues from the perception by the majority that "everyone does it" and that the rules are not being enforced--that "the system" lacks legitimacy.  In other countries, illegitimacy might lead to revolution, a revolt of the masses.  In the USA, still a very rich country, the poor are cheating on the margins while the rich are looting the country, and we are not yet at a "tipping point" such as a new Great Depression might inspire.
<br />
<br />This is a thoughtful book, and it does not deserve the negative comments from those whom the book most likely is describing all too well.  Cheating diminishes trust and reduces value.  America has become corrupt across all the professions, within Congress, within the media, within the political level of government (the civil service remains a bastion of propriety).
<br />
<br />What price freedom?  What price the Republic?  You may or may not choose to agree with this author's diagnosis and prescription, but in my view, he gets to the heart of the matter.  It's about integrity.  We've lost it.</span>

                    <span>I had been looking forward to reading this book for almost a year since its author was on a tv show.  Finally, I got around to it and have to admit I was very disappointed.  Callahan spends 75% of the book saying that the main reason for so much cheating in society is because of free market capitalism.  Acceptable reasoning I suppose for people like Gary Winnick, Ken Lay, Jeffery Skilling et al...but is this really the core reason why high school students or college students copy a paper off the internet and hand it in as their own???  Not from my experience as a college student/high school teacher.  They do it because they're lazy and its so easy to spend 5 minutes finding a paper than to spend 4+ hours to get the same grade (or better).  Only about 25% of the book deals with actual cheating and the different professions it is common in (academia, law, medicine, etc..), while the other 75% is him complaining/trying to suggest how to curb the free market to eliminate cheating.  He does have some valid points such as 1) the SEC and IRS both need much better funding and staff to pursue unethical corporations and individuals and 2) there needs to be much more attention paid to cheating in all levels of academia especially with regards to punishments and the apathy displayed by many teachers/professors.  He tries to lay out a theory that the people at the bottom end of the spectrum are cheating because they see that they can't do any better with hard work and effort and they can't make ends meet as it is.  Yet he only talks about 1 or 2 examples of this.  95% of the cheating situations described in detail are affluent kids/adults such as the lawyers, doctors, corporate executives, sports stars (albeit briefly), and high school kids at the best prep schools (public and private).  In my opinion, the free market is not a bad idea it just needs to have stronger regulating laws and groups.  Maybe this is exactly his view, but I can't quite tell because he spends so much time railing against the decades of Greed (1980-2000) it's hard to tell.  Also, he at one point mentions that suburban sprawl (and that fact that people live further apart instead of right next to each other in neighborhoods) is one small thing that somehow contributes to cheating.  I still haven't figured this connection out (living right next door makes us more friendly to our neighbors which makes us better people and cheat less?) but maybe you can.  I should have known what was in it when I saw Robert Reich had a quote praising it on the back. </span>

                    <span>Look at the so-called "leader of the free world", Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld. Can you name any bigger cheats and liers? And the amazing way they get away with it? Blind Americans give them the go-ahead to cheat, lie, and kill in the name of power and money. Damn, after 4 years of nothing but lying to us, they got re-elected! Americans have no one to blame but themselves as we slip into fascism.
<br />I've never seen nor heard of any bigger immoral, lying, disgraceful people in this country in my life. They make Nixon look like a moral upstanding citizen. The message to the youth - cheat and lie to get ahead or be left behind.
<br />Hail to the cheat!
