                <span id="Label1">Kim Meeder has seen horses go where no one else can tread - stepping through the minefield of a broken child's soul in a dance of trust that only God can understand. From a mistreated horse to an emotionally starved child and back again, a torrent of love washes away their barren places. Kim's ranch is a place where this miracle happens over and over again. It is a place where the impossible flourishes, where dreams survive the inferno of reality - a place where hope rises.</span>

                    <span>Having recently re-entered the world of horses, I'm constantly on the lookout for quality books about all things horse-related. When I came across Hope Rising at a local Christian bookstore, I knew this was one book that I had to get. From the cover art to the comments on the back, to the brief selection I read through, the book grabbed my heart.<P>Kim has a gift of being able to relate the stories of Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch in a powerful and beautiful way. Her heart for the Lord and for His children and creatures shows through in every story. She addresses the horrors of what she's seen and experienced in a way that's honest, but doesn't overdo it with graphic details. Her focus remains on the Hope she refers to in the book's title. She always comes back to the fact that God can make beauty from ashes, no matter how hopeless a situation seems.<P>This book is one that anyone would benefit from reading, regardless of their feelings about horses. I know for me, it's already been life-changing. Kim and her husband's work at Crystal Peak is an inspiration for anyone who wants to impact the world for Christ, no matter what the arena in which they choose to do so.</span>
