                    <span>A solid trip through the drama that is the science of Space. Deftly delivered details of the wealth of data gathered thus far by the world's astronomical community. The masterfully designed menus move the viewer effortlessly to the desired content segment. They are SO nice, you can sit and watch them and be entertained. <P>As a documentary, the facts are well presented and conveyed in digestible chunks. Concepts like Earth/Mars similarities, and life's early transport across the Sol system, were introduced seamlessly and reinforced throughout the volumes. As a drama, yes a drama, thematic and conceptual material is expertly woven throughout the entire series. <P>Technically, this set is a gem. It is a shining example of masterful editing techniques, Computer graphics production, DVD production methods, and videography.<P>On the whole, "The Planets" is a must buy for anyone interested in learning more about the cosmos. There's even a cameo of the well loved and sorely missed Carl Sagan. Shine on Carl!<P>A MUST BUY.</span>

                    <span>Welcome to the best documentary series ever. Yes, BETTER than Dinosaurs (which depended largely on sensational computer visuals)! Whether you have only a passing interest in astronomy or have read a hundred books about it, this series will steal your heart. Every single aspect is flawless. The musical grandeur of Gustav Holst's symphony and the warm, captivating voice of the British narrator make up the aurals. No artificial excitement, no badly chosen music, PERFECT. The visuals include stylish computer animations and footage that makes you wonder how deep they actually had to dig... The first footage of a human being outside the atmosphere (jumping out of a balloon), the first on-board rocket footage, the earth as a blue dot captured by an ageing Voyager looking back at its birthplace. The content isn't exactly dumbed down, either. Even for an amateur like me, there were plenty of new things to discover. It contains many interviews with astronauts, Russian and American space-project leaders, the finest available planetary geologists, exo-biologists and trendsetting astronomers. Providing not only information, but also a true sense of passion and childlike wonder. Hear how an American airforce officer tries to describe his silent jump through the outher layers of our atmosphere, falling back into "known territory". How Gene Cernan had the almost transcendental experience of covering all of human history (earth) with his thumb. How a NASA scientist was the first to see the other side of Saturn via a Voyager picture... If this series doesn't get you excited, you must be dead.</span>

                    <span><BR><BR>This is acceptable for young children, because no topic is covered at any length at any one time. This is fine for kids who can't sit still long enough to get a lot of detail. And the presentation continues for four disks, revisiting most topics at least once.<BR><BR>Unfortunately it doesn't really do more than reiterate pretty trite information and opinions, despite the abundance of interviews with quite a number of people in the US and former Soviet space programs. The fact that the USSR made an attempt to probe Mars in 1961 is remarkable, but the complete failure of the mission is not mentioned at all.<BR><BR>Probably the best of the eight programs in this collection is "Moon", which is strictly about the Apollo missions to the Moon, which remain the most amazing achievement of the space age. Also, that program has a single focus and doesn't jump around. The other program from disk two is "Giants", which recounts the US probes to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.<BR><BR>"Life Beyond the Sun" on disk four discusses the labeled release experiment, which did in fact detect microbial life on Mars. The program only gives the official NASA view that no life was found, and doesn't bother to interview Gilbert V. Levin, who designed the experiment, and has a long series of published papers defending the results of the experiment and debunking the inorganic chemical "explanations".<BR><BR>The oddly named "Terra Firma" (an ancient name for the Earth) gives a survey of various probe missions to Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and the Moon. "Atmosphere" again discusses Venus and Mars, and repeats the silly claim that there's a "greenhouse effect" at work.<BR><BR>The main deficiency of this package is the repetition and lack of focus. I would have liked more in-depth discussion of (for example) the search for the various planets X (Tombaugh, Van Flandern, but emphatically NOT Zecharia Sitchin, Andrew Collins, et al), focussed comets as an argument in favor of the existence of one, and critical arguments of the possible existence of a trans-Neptunian major planet.<BR><BR>I'd suggest getting this from the video store first and seeing if your children like it, then purchase it if they do.<BR><BR></span>

                    <span>This series was okay, but could have been much better. Like all the BCC's work you can't fault it technically, but the abundance of talking heads does get annoying (though there is a little bit of CG). Any fan of space will find the knowledge they recite as rudimentary at best. It's okay for a novice, but otherwise it's pretty boring to hear a guy in a lab tell you basic facts about the solar system. <P>Some of the archival footage, particularly of the Russian space program is very interesting, however.<P>Space is incredible but show it to me, don't tell me about it! I think the BBC's upcoming 'Walking with Spacemen' series, which will be 100 percent CGI and use the technology to recreate what it would be like to visit various planets and moons in the Solarsystem will be much more interesting (If you have seen Walking with Dinosaurs then you'll know what kind of breathtaking visuals they should come up with).<P>Anyway, till then, the Planets is still a great series.</span>

                    <span>*I watched the original BBC version with the male narrating (i think Richard CHamberlain was name)... Apparently some people don't like the american dub.... why they bothered to make it in the first place is a bit confusing.*<P>Even if you're uninterested in space, other planets, or earth's own origins and achievements, The Planets is worth a vieiwing on the merits of the genrally spectacular visuals alone, and is very capable of sparking an interest in even the most dormant of brains (mine). Although much of the CGI is low-budget tv quality (from 1999~2000), it's generally kept to a minium and the better cgi (like the simulations of an expanding sun) is MUCH better. It avoids the overly serious tone in the narration that seems to be common to these types of documentaries, and although there is some content overlap between segments, it doesn't diminish the experience.<P>This is a must see for anyone and everyone (although you can probably catch it on A+E or one of the BBC america channels, rather than spend 80 dollars for this box set (which is worth it, I think- though there are a number of equally worthwhile documentaries that cover some similar ground in a much more intellectual fashion, like Cosmos and Stephen Hawking's Universe, but I haven't seen any that, visually, really convey how fantastic the universe is as much as this one).</span>
