                    <span>"The Millionaire Next Door" takes an interesting look into the lives of millionaires in America in 1996.  Unlike what most people think, the people who have the biggest houses, drive the fanciest cars, wear the most expensive clothes are in fact not millionaires and are also not wealthy.
<br />
<br />Stanley and Danko observe what characteristics make up a wealthy person and why the people who we think are wealthy are in fact not wealthy.  Mostly it boiled down to wealthy people are frugal and are more entrepreneurial than the upper class doctors, lawyers and executives.  The people who look wealthy but in fact are not spend far too much of their money on consumer items to give the "look" of being wealthy, as opposed to investments.
<br />
<br />My biggest beef with this book was it read like a specialized statistics textbook.  They have packed a lot of statistics into this book, some useful, some not useful at all.  That makes reading this book rather tedious at times.  It also felt like the authors were drawing out some of the points longer than they needed to be.  Being shorter and more concise potentially could have made this book easier to read.
<br />
<br />Regardless, this book contains some excellent information that everyone should know about.  If you are looking into increasing your wealth, you can't go wrong with this book.  4 out of 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>Although this book is not bad, it is somewhat repetitive and slow. The authors discuss some common misconceptions regarding wealthy Americans, which is a little interesting, and then go on to describe how one should go about acquiring wealth. While I think everything these authors say about acquiring wealth is true, I also believe it is common sense. There are some statistical tables that the authors include which demonstrate their points (and help alleviate the reader of boredom). 
<br />Overall I gave this book a three because it's very mediocre. </span>

                    <span>Practical, intelligent producers and consumers, frugal low-key living, and great planning help make this minority group one smart gang.  They mostly live well below what they are worth and they live next to you and me, most act like everyday people.   Some are teachers, writers, physicians, and lawyers.  The majority however are small business people and entrepreneurs in both usual and unusual businesses.  Much can be learned from this research...mostly that these folk are risk takers and very independent. You will be able to see then in every community.</span>

                    <span>This book gives the reader some good food for thought regarding the benefits of living below one's means and the differences between wealth and materials, but it turns out to be unrealistic. The authors suggest not spending more than twice your income on your home, but in my area - and many others - that is just not possible for the great majority of people. They also continuously discuss the success of small business owners in building wealth, but downplay the fact that most small business owners don't succeed with their businesses. There is also lots of "filler" material relating to the mathematics of wealth that is just unnecessary and overly drawn out. What is the point of calculating the price of a car by the pound? That certainly isn't the best measure of a cars value and is much less important than safety, reliability, economy, utility and performance.  If you are a doctor, lawyer, or a business owner that likes to spend more money than you make this might be a good eye opener, but this book isn't targeted at the average person and I just didn't find it to be useful. </span>

                    <span>This is another interesting book that could have been a 5 to 10-page brilliant article.  Repetitive to the extreme, the authors go on and on and on and on...
<br />But I am glad I read this book.
<br />There is only one issue I wish was addressed.  Being frugal and living below your means is good.  After all, there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in a watch or in shoes.  However, there MUST be a balance in life.  What is the point of having money if it is not to spend?  Who needs lead a miserable life only to die with 5 million in net worth?
<br />I wish the authors would address this issue, or at least mention that there is a balance and this choice is beyond the scope of their book.  Instead, it looks like the "pursuit of wealth" is a constitutional obligation of every citizen.</span>
