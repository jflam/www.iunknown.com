                    <span>This book gave me a little bit of useful historical information, but was poorly written. I threw it across the room a couple times, after reading one too many non sequiturs.<p>Here's the premise: By the turn of the 20th  century, America was transforming rapidly into an industrialized nation.  With its influx of immigrants andits blurring class distinctions, one  Victorian standard abandoned by American society was the strict gender  lines of social life: Men and women began to associate in public. According  to Ullman, this was the seed that led public opinion around sex and gender  to begin shifting toward what we know now as publicly acceptable  heterosexuality. <p>The examples presented in this  doctoral-thesis-cum-paperback are limited to the court records of  Sacramento, California, and entertainment such as early film and  vaudeville. The author notes that, at the time, a personally fulfilling  sexuality became more important to married people than reproductive sex and  that female impersonators were challenging the audience's views of gender  roles and prompting the print media to comment at length on the physical  traits that were signs of being "less than" one's gender.  Meanwhile, the white, middle-class Reform Movement battled what they saw as  societal moral decay. Their efforts centered around the skyrocketing  divorce rate, homosexuality and prostitution, inadvertently bringing these  issues into a larger public consciousness. <p>Ullman presents much more  such evidence, but her points are inconclusive. She does not explain how  those turbulent times shaped our current societal ideals.  Strangely, the  author's comments on non-heterosexuality are limited to men and she makes  little effort to consolidate her observations of attitudes around gender  roles and identification, especially those of women. Also strange is that  of all the photos in the book, almost all of them were of one female  impersonator. One very important point that she nearly missed completely  was the cultural shift toward identifying people by their sexual practices.  The book left me with questions; it could have been twice as long. The  topic was very broad; she chose to limit her sources severely, which, I  think, was a mistake. Sex Seen offers an interesting peek into the sexual  attitudes of ordinary people at the time, but she should have had a better  editor or collaborated with a professional writer.</span>
