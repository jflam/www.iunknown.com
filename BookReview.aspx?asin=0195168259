                <span id="Label1">Entrepreneurs often struggle with many aspects of business: planning and financing company growth, creating a company vision, recruiting, leading, and managing people, as well as personal costs. In Lessons from the Edge, more than 50 business owners and entrepreneurs offer a wealth of real-life stories--in their own words--that provide rare insights about keeping a company healthy and growing.  Here is a unique collection of first-person accounts by entrepreneurs who describe their mistakes in business and the lessons they have learned as a result. The stories cover a wide range of experiences from the trials and tribulations of partnerships, to the loss of key customers, theft, finding and retaining employees, and the personal cost of living on the edge. The authors have drawn on interviews with more than 50 entrepreneurs, all of whom are under 45 years of age and are founders or presidents of companies with revenues over $1million and growing rapidly. They volunteered to share their stories, describing why they lost or almost lost their companies, what they did wrong, and the lessons they have learned. Their narratives are full of mistakes, failure, courage, moments of realization, and timely moves that saved the day. Every company owner will find these accounts insightful, compelling, and occasionally gut wrenching, especially because most face similar challenges and live with the reality that they too could fall off the edge. This instructive and inspiring book brims with lessons for all business owners about courage, persistence, and survival. Lessons from the Edge is an essential read for both established and prospective entrepreneurs.</span>

                    <span>It was great to read the numerous and varied stories that real life entrepreneurs face on an ongoing basis. It is from these stories that the fabric of what it means to be an entrepreneur is woven - and for myself as the reader to be able to learn valuable lessons from the experiences of others. I now have the opportunity to take that value, apply it to my own business, personal and entrepreneurial life and realize a more rewarding and rich destiny - without going over the Edge!</span>

                    <span>Having read many business books, Lessons from the Edge offers a different prospective for entrepreneurs. It is not so much a "how to" book but rather one that highlights the negative consequences of bad decisions. These are life lessons that can be learned from others rather than yourself. I've heard it said that good men learn from their own mistakes but great men learn from the mistakes of others. This is a perfect opportunity to do that kind of learning.<P>Each chapter is a fast read. At the end of each section, there is a summary of important lessons learned.<P>In running my own business, I found some that some chapters were too familiar from my own experience. This is a great book to help you stay away from the "Edge".</span>

I have made several of the mistakes in varing degrees and it's good to see that I am not alone. It was afirming to see that I am on track with several things that I am working on in my business and have been working on for some time. It will stay on my shelf as a referance.</span>

I for one would much rather learn from the challenges of others before forcing myself to learn the hard way out of ignorance. This book provided over 40 opportunities to do just that. This book goes a long way in filling the gaps in my experience and I would suggest it to every would be and current entrepreneur</span>
