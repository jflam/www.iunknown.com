                    <span>If you aim to be a DBA the first thing you should do , before reading a specific DB Vendor book, is to read something about general database aspects like data integrity, security, performance etc.
<br />This one does the job. After reading the book I was quickly able to dive into Oracle ( and now a DBA ).
<br />But ( a commercial trick ) the book doesn't provide ( as promised in cover ) is detailed information on every main DB brand. But we all know this is not possible within a book, even at this size.
<br />Tough, who cares?</span>

                    <span>This book need a re-write to bring it up to the latest SQL standards.  If you are still using Pre-SQL92 systems, this book is a pretty good reference.<p>However, it leaves out important new information such as the new JOIN syntax.<p>I recommend you check other texts to ensure this is the *one* that you want.</span>

                    <span>Excellent book, I bought it simply because I wanted to have a reference book for SQL syntax.  Don't expect this book to teach you about normal forms and whatnot, it covers the ANSI SQL standard (even SQL2) only, thereby, you'd need to pick up a book on normalization.<p>A note to people starting with databases: this book covers SQL syntax, it contains evaluation versions of SQL Server, DB2, and etc.  It doesn't cover the actual DBMS themselves, there are books reserved for that.  Lastly, before you buy this book, know the theories of relational database design such as normalization, the ideology behind relational database design is fundamental to database design, administration, and maintenance.</span>

                    <span>This book is, at the same time, too complete and not complete enough. The entire back half of it deals with things I'll never need, but when it came time to learn the functions, there was hardly any discussion. I've noted that this is the major gripe of other people as well.<p>Still, it's many, many, many simple examples are very helpful to a novice/intermediate user such as myself, and I've found it easy to follow because of them.</span>

                    <span>The book is merely a re-package of the first edition; and what makes things worse - none of the errors of the first one were ever fixed:(it still claims, for instance that Oracle's stored procedures params must be declared as VARCHAR(10) - i.e. it must be sized; such syntax could not possibly compile),some examples do not compile..... Appendix shows installation of Informix,DB2 UDB 5.2, Oracle 8 and MS SQL Server 7.0 - from the first edition,while this second edition's disk includes only SQL Server 2000, DB2 7.1 and MySQL; this had undermined my trust in the "up-to-date content", claimed by the preface and the cover. As in the previous edition, it concentrates on the standard SQL, much of which has nothing to do with implementations (e.g. DOMAIN keyword). Chapter on functions lists 7, 9 (?)functions - out of hundreds implemented by RDBMS!<br><br>To be true, the book was spiced up with several new chapters on XML, EJB etc - a mile wide, an inch deep in coverage...I'd be better off buying separate books on the subject. I wish I could return it. If you cannot avoid it - buy the first edition and save tens of dollars; or - better yet - look for a different book.</span>
