                <span id="Label1"><I>Boat Docking (Close Quarters Maneuvering for Small Craft)</i> is a book about how to dock a boat! <P>It contains many concrete examples of boat docking, from the elementary to the advanced, and also has chapters discussing the theory of close quarters maneuvering. The book is comprehensive, yet achieves its depth using language and tone which are accessible and minimally technical. <P>Although <I>Boat Docking</i> can be read through from start to finish, each of its various sections also stands alone, so items of interest may be referred to individually. <P><I>Boat Docking</i> contains an "Overview" section, followed by a chapter describing every basic docking example imaginable, and most of the esoteric ones. Other chapters explain the interactions of the hull with water and air, how a boat steers (it's not completely straightforward!), how to use lines and fenders (there is more to good line work than one would think), and then there is a short section on the psychology and sociology of docking. Don't worry, it's fun to read! The conclusion draws an intriguing parallel between boat docking and affairs of the heart, using an extended metaphor on "close quarters maneuvering"! <P>If there's anything important to say about close quarters maneuvering, you'll find it in <I>Boat Docking</i>.</span>

The binding however was so poor that the book completely fell apart before I got through with Chapter 2. The rating is solely for content, not construction.</span>

                    <span>I am a fairly new boat owner with a twenty-four foot inboard. Kudos for Mr. Low in writing a fun, easy to understand book which helped me understand the dinamics at work when you are on the water. This book helped me in to this new journey, with practical advice. It is for the beginer, but comes with ideas and processes that one needs to understand, and remember, even when experienced. Thank you Mr. Low for being there with a great introduction to boat handling, and for keeping it simple to understand. Other books I have purchased get too wordy and use trade terminoligy that I sometimes don't understand. This book got my thumbs up; you woun't regret it if you are a beginer.</span>

                    <span>I recently purchased a 24 foot boat with an inboard engine. I wanted to be more familiar with the process of mooring/tying up/docking. I found myself applying lessons from the book to my actual experience. The book is well illustrated and writen in a clear and simple (sometimes humerous) way. It is well spent money for the lesons you will learn and aply. My thanks to the author.</span>

                    <span>As a relatively new boater docking into a slip in a crowded marina on a calm day let alone a windy one has been at times a most intimidating experience. Dr. Low's book is an easy and fun read filled with lots of practical advice and good humor. I quickly realized I was not alone with my anxiety about docking and have learned much from the author's experience. Comments relative to the psychological issues were just as helpful as the mechanical aspects. I highly recommend this book.</span>
