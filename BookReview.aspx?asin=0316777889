                    </div>
                    <span>Perhaps my only mistake was choosing to start reading this book the same night I had finished John Feinstein's most recent effort, "Let Me Tell You a Story," his book about the legendary Celtics figure, Red Auerbach. For that reason and that reason only, it took me a little longer to get into this one. After all, following that one is almost impossible. 
<br />
<br />But this one does. It is at times funny and sad and as a result, there are times this book brings out a smile, but many times it brings out a tear. But through it all, Feinstien's gift for telling a story makes this book one of the best books I have read. It is a story about a caddy with ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Bruce Edwards, the long-time caddy to golf great Tom Watson, was diagnosed with the fatal illness in January of 2003, a little more than two years ago. The book chronicles his life on the PGA Tour with, not only his brother-like relationship with Watson, but with everyone who ever came into his life. It is apparent that he touched a lot of lives during his 30+ year career on tour. 
<br />
<br />Through it all, until the end, Edwards was a picture of perservearance, bravery and courage. He refused to let the illness get the better of him. If memory serves, Edwards passed away shortly after this book was published. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span>Being an Avid Golfer, I was drawn by this story of courage under the face of the biggest adversity a person could ever face, knowing you are going to die. This story is a touching tribute to Bruce Edwards, the long time caddy to PGA tour vetran Tom Watson and a tribute to Bruce as not only a great caddy but a great person as well. It is a story of two men who forged a freindship over the years that brought them "Closer than Brothers" and a tribute to the class and dignity in which Bruce displayed in facing ALS or "Lou Gehrigs" disease. 
<br />We never know if and when something devestating will hit us or someone we love, but Bruce Edwards shows that you can have dignity in dying and that the Human Spirit prevails in the worse of conditions. A must read right there with Tuesdays with Morrie!

                    <span>Never quitting what he was passionate about, that was Bruce Edwards.  Certainly he was passionate about caddying, about caddying for Tom Watson, passionate about always being upbeat and humorous.  "AT least Lou Gehrig was a great athlete.  I'd rather tell people I have Gehrig's disease than Liberace's disease."
<br />
<br />He set standard for pro caddies before finding out he had this dreaded killer.  
<br />
<br />This consumate team which had been through so much thrilled the sporting world at Olympia Fields.  Watson's passion for his friend and his plight.  
<br />
<br />Feinstein's wordsmithing of this unique relationship and its unfurling from a fateful incident where hhe missed out caddying for veteran Dale Douglass only to chance upon a new upstart yound college grad from Stanford.  
<br />
<br />The rest is golfing history and told so well in this engaging and emotionally charged book.  
<br />
<br />May it inspire much good in the game and for this dreaded killer of a disease.</span>

                    <span>Do you have a long-time friend who has made a big difference in your life?  I hope so.  
<br />
<br />Bruce Edwards and Tom Watson have been blessed to have one another as friends for over 30 years.  Mr. Edwards was Mr. Watson's primary caddy for all but four years of that time.  They've supported each other through victory, defeat, family problems, and serious illnesses.  Both are graceful men who want to help others and take responsibility for their own actions.  That friendship became more important to both of them in 2003 when Bruce Edwards was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) and they knew their friendship would soon be over.  This book features the magnificent story of how both of them responded in uncommonly valiant and wonderful ways to this new challenge.  
<br />
<br />This book will be most appealing to those who have been caddies, fans of Tom Watson, those who know someone with ALS, people who value friendship and those who appreciate the potential of the human spirit to rise above the physical world.
<br />
<br />Although this book is a memoir about Mr. Edwards, you cannot tell a caddy's story without talking about the people he caddied for so there's lots of golf history including Mr. Watson's famous chip-in at the 17th hole at Pebble Beach, his many British Open wins and keen insights into the character of many famous golfers (including Greg Norman for whom Mr. Edwards caddied for four years).  
<br />
<br />You will learn how Mr. Edwards decided upon caddying as a career.  He had caddied at his home country club in Connecticut where a tour event was held annually, and loved caddying for a pro in that tournament.  Having disliked the discipline of school, he enjoyed the freedom and camaraderie of the links.  Upon graduating from high school, he persuaded his parents to let him try his hand at caddying for a year.  At that time, there were few caddies who worked regularly on the tour.  Mr. Edwards soon got Mr. Watson's bag . . . and kept it.
<br />
<br />Naturally optimistic and positive, Mr. Edwards has always been generous in sharing those traits with other golfers . . . even Mr. Watson's opponents.  You'll find out about the many times he helped Mr. Watson get an advantage that might otherwise not have been his.  
<br />
<br />Facing a near-term death sentence, Mr. Edwards soldiered on as best he could in the 2003 season.  He made the best of his rapidly diminishing physical capabilities, and was generous in helping make others feel more comfortable around him.  Mr. Watson responded by playing at the top of his game for a man his age so that he could share more success with Mr. Edwards.  Mr. Watson also took on a crusade to raise money for ALS research hoping to help save Mr. Edwards' life.  It's a beautiful, touching and memorable story.
<br />
<br />The book's main weakness is that it is a little too much about Mr. Watson prior to 2003 and a bit too little about Mr. Edwards in those years as well.  I would have liked to know more about Mr. Edwards' views on golf and caddying . . . and his advice for the rest of us. 
<br />
<br />If you don't have that long-time friend, you need to start looking.
<br />
<br />I suggest that you consider giving this book as a gift to young people to help them understand how to build a meaningful, satisfying and contributing life.        </span>

                    <span>Bruce Edwards was passionate about golf, and he realized at a young age that the itinerant life of a caddy was ideal for him.  He worked mostly with one man, the great Tom Watson, who also became his lifelong friend.  If Edwards had not been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease when he was in his late forties, this book would not have been written.  However, in 2003, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic told Edwards that he had only a short time to live. "Caddy for Life," by John Feinstein, is the poignant, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting story of this courageous man.<p>Feinstein writes knowledgeably not just about Bruce Edwards, but also about the game of golf.  When Edwards started out as a caddy, he worked for peanuts, and his living accommodations were spartan.  It was only in later years that Edwards and other caddies gleaned substantial financial rewards for their efforts. People like Edwards completely changed the nature of caddying.  Edwards studied each golf course thoroughly and took meticulous notes about every bump and ridge on each green. In many ways, a sharp and experienced caddy can raise a golfer's game to a higher level, and Edwards was one of the best caddies in the game.<p>"Caddy for Life" is, most of all, an emotional paean to the close friendship that developed between Tom Watson and Bruce Edwards.  Since they went through so much during their almost thirty years together on various golf courses, Watson and Edwards knew and loved each other like brothers.  Watson cried often in the days and months after Edwards told him the grim news about his fatal illness.  Since then, Watson has done his best to raise awareness as well as funds for research that may someday lead to a cure for this horrendous disease.<p>Edwards's illness devastated his loved ones, including his parents and three siblings.  What a cruel fate that a short time after Edwards proposed to the love of life, Marsha, he was diagnosed with ALS. However, he refused to shut himself in his room and brood about his misfortune.  Edwards spent the rest of his life caddying with Watson to the best of his ability, and fighting the disease that was robbing him of his speech and his strength. <p>"Caddy for Life" is not only about the sadness of a man cut down in his prime.  It is also an entertaining and often amusing account of how various golfers have struggled to tackle some of the most challenging courses in the world.  Feinstein illustrates time and again that golf is as much a mental as a physical game, and few golfers have the psychological makeup to handle the pressure.  "Caddy for Life" is an engrossing, moving, and informative look at the world of golf and at one particular individual who has left an indelible mark on the game he loved so much.</span>
