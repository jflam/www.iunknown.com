                <span id="Label1">One of Ludwig Mi&euml;s van der Rohe's favorite aphorisms was that "God is in the details." Jon Franklin would beg to differ. A pretty turn of phrase is no use at all, says he, if you don't have a firm structure on which to hang it. Franklin pioneered the field of creative nonfiction by applying fiction's classical complication-resolution form to standard nonfiction (specifically to news stories, most of which, he states, are generally "endings without beginnings attached"). Instead of focusing on style, grammar, and word use, as do many books on writing, <i>Writing for Story</i> provides a rigorous lesson in building a nonfiction story (short or long) that has structural integrity. Franklin advocates starting with an outline, writing the climax first, and engaging in other grueling tasks that seem like hard work because they are.  </span>

                    <span>Lay people often suggest that journalists are bums, that writers get paid to watch a ball game or a movie or whatever their beats may entail. They fail to realize that the crux of the job lays with the writing. This book makes the observations of those lay people a bit more applicable -- writing a great story and seeing its components are fundamental skills that aren't difficult to learn. Read "Writing for Story," and you'll be that much closer to living the life of a writer with few worries. (Thanks to Dr. Dennis Jackson of the University of Delaware's journalism department for leading years of students to this wonderful book.)</span>

                    <span>Franklin applies the principles of fiction (conflict, rising action, climax, denouement, characterization, description, etc.) to nonfiction in order to turn facts into a narrative that moves like a short story. The result is highly effective, but it has one major drawback: many topics do not lend themselves to this kind of treatment.<P>Imagine writing a piece on arms control in this manner. The only way to do it would be to select a negotiator as the protagonist, then manipulate the gathered facts in order to create a "story." God help you if the negotiations go well, and there is no antagonist. Without a conflict, you're out of luck.<P>For a much better and more general approach to nonfiction, try reading William E. Blundell's book, "The Art and Craft of Feature Writing." It offers a highly adaptable system capable of handling topics of an abstract nature in a concrete, approachable way.<P>I found Franklin's sample stories to be cloying. He has no qualms about milking the dramatic elements for all they're worth, especially if it means ceaselessly repeating ambient sounds he thinks will lend tension to the story. This technique is the prose equivalent of the loud hearbeat filmmakers use to unnerve you during climactic scenes. It's tacky, pure and simple.</span>

                    <span>As a two-time pulitzer winner, Jon Franklin tries to elaborate how he was able to convert a newspaper story into a fiction and win a pulitzer for it. This sounding pretty interesting, I started this book and learnt something indeed. <P>The author presents two characteristic stories, explains in detail the methodology he takes in writing stories and applies them perfectly to make us understand.<P>The methods and the dissection of a story are wise and stories are interesting. Well Worth a read if you intend to make your write up interesting.</span>

                    <span>Jon Franklin's book was a disappointment. There were a few good tips in the book, but they were nothing new to anyone who is studying how to write good non-fiction. These same pieces of advice could be found in any high school text book. The only difference is that the structure of this book makes it hard to find a specific piece of information. There is no index or glossary to make this book a useful reference book. <P>I found the book difficult to read because he devoted much of the book to describing what a wonderful writer he thinks he is. I would have found the book more useful if he included examples of works written by other authors along with an analysis of why he liked their work.<P>One last complaint about this book: Jon refers to a story written about a mother having trouble loving her mongoloid child. As a special educator, I find it very offensive that he did not correct this outdated term and replace it with the term Down syndrome.</span>
