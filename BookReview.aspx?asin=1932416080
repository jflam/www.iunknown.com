                <span id="Label1">McSweeney's Quarterly Concern #13 is all comics. It is edited by Chris Ware (author of Jimmy Corrigan: Smartest Kid on Earth), and features so many artists to know and love: R. Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Daniel Clowes, Lynda Barry, Los Bros Hernandez, Adrian Tomine, Julie Doucet, and on and on. The issue also includes essays from Michael Chabon, Ira Glass, John Updike, Chip Kidd, and others. A hardcover, clothbound edition, this quarterly comes with an enormous dust jacket that does much more than guard against dust. This one makes our throats go tight.</span>

                    <span>The book is a selection of modern comics and graphic storytelling. The look of the book is so unlike anything in modern literature today...it is beautifully constructed. I read mine straight through, and I was floored by the individual intelligence and originality of its contributors. The editor, Chris Ware, has a beautiful set piece about a young handicapped woman. Works by Charles Burns, Ivan Brunetti, Kim Deitch, and Richard McGuire were also strong. Some historical pieces regarding the history of comics and its early masters (Schulz and George Herriman) are fascinating. However, by taking the entire book as a whole, I became underwhelmed by consistent themes: suicide, alienation, stagnation, sexual frustration, even abortion. Does every young comic artist only deal with these issues? I missed the triumph and majesty of the comics of my youth, and wished just a few of the stories and vignettes dealt with some hint of a happy ending. The book left me feeling sorry for the authors of modern graphic novels of today.</span>

                    <span>An incredible feat of editing and printing. Which might not sound like much until you hold this thing in your hands. Chris Ware continues to be one of the finest craftspeople working in contemporary visual culture. His own drawn and written contributions here are at least as good as his work on his own projects, but it's the sheer quality of the overall packaging, design, and fine detail that makes McSweeney's 13 so good. If this thing doesn't win some major book awards, there's no justice.</span>

                    <span>...quite possibly the finest piece of literature I have ever held in my hands. It's an issue devoted entirely to comics, and aesthetically, I have never seen anything like it. First is the dust jacket - made to look like a daily sheet, it's intricately covered with different designs and characters, and then folded up very nicely around the book. Tucked in pockets on both the front and back are smaller, booklet type comics.<P>Inside, the issue is guest edited by Chris Ware and is positively stunning. Lots and lots of full color pages with comics by Daniel Clowes, Chris Ware, R. Crumb, Lynda Barry, Mark Newgarden (The Little Nun), and a newly discovered favorite, Richard McGuire. Also, some history of the comics from the editor.<P>If you like comics (especially the more conceptually adventurous ones) you'll love this book. If you don't like comics, or don't know if you like comics, go and look at it anyway. You might be surprised.</span>

                    <span>Chris Ware, (ACME Novelty Library, Jimmy Corrigan) guest edits this edition of McSweeney's a spotlight on graphic image narrative. Ware designs in his inimitable, meticulous style what is McSweeney's most handsome volume yet and provides a sturdy editorial structure (including fascinating historical reference and essays as well as his own history of comics). Most of the contributers are artists you'll recognise from independent or self-produced comics, zines, and strips, as well as from low-art magazines like Juxtapoz. These are interspersed with essays by word people (like John Updke) about images. Like every issue of McSweeney's, the grab bag quality is what makes it most successful, you'll see names you know next to names you don't; you'll be surprised by what you find yourself liking and moreover you'll find yourself appreciating the keen vision behind the scenes that pushes each piece of the kaliedescope in front of your eyes. Kudos to McSweeny's for recognising that this insurgent medium that deserves it's own place on Barnes and Noble's shelf, but a larger and more heartfelt amount of recognition should go to Mr. Ware for producing what could really be the Norton Anthology of Graphic Storytelling. The book is thoughtfuilly designed and masterfully put together, benefitting from the attention to detail that makes Ware's artwork so distinctive as well as the sheer quality of the work presented. None of the stories rest on the novelty of being 'comics in a straight book', at their best they are profoundly moving studies that showcase an artist struglling and succeeding in their medium. A deluxe sized fold-out cover, (designed to look like the funnies page) and two mini-comics are included and add to the overall grab-bag feel and leave the reader feeling like, if nothing else, he got a lot for his 25 bucks. If you are a fan of comic strips, comic books, graphic art; if you liked American Splendor, or Ghost World, if you are a fan of experimental narrative, or if you are simply curious what everyone is talking about when they refer to this curious, beautiful medium, be sure to check this out, it's an excellent primer for the curious and to the initiated it's a must-have watermark for how far the medium can go.</span>

                    <span>What a beautiful object this "issue" of McSweeney's is. It is delightful to hold and look at. The lay-out is very nice and the comics are outstanding. Many of the essays are quite good, too although they are outshiced by the comics by far! Ira Glass and Chip Kidd wrote my favorite essays. Chris Ware has written some wonderful historical essays as well.<BR>Many of the comics are reprinted from their original books; Adrian Tomine's, Chester Brown's, Joe Saccos's, Charles Burns' and maybe others that i didn't recognize. It is nice to have them all together with other great comics though so doesn't detract from the package.<BR>One area that I was concerned with is the underrepresentation of women cartoonists. While the three presented are excellent choices (Debbie Dreschler, Lynda Barrym and Julie Doucette) I was disappointed in the ratio of men to women cartoonists. I don't look for quotas with this sort of thing, but it is pretty clear that women are under-represented in this issue. Nonetheless, buy this wonderful collection!</span>
