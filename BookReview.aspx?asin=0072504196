                    <span>I have taught from this book for almost five years now; it is in its seventh edition, has a CD Rom now that includes video clips. The book is comprehensive, and no single semester course can cover everything in it; but I think it is a great book to teach from. First, it is WELL WRITTEN. Next, it is organized well. Finally, the speeches it contains are great examples---both student speeches, and those from the public sector. I recommend to all my students NOT to sell it, but to keep it for reference later.</span>

                    <span>From the inauspiciously multicultural front cover to the very last page, this book definitely has not-so-subtle politically correct overtones; most notable is the section on avoiding overtly masculine language. Its political bent is unabashedly left-wing. As a speech book, however, there are actually some very helpful tips; I found the section on overcoming nervousness well-designed and thought out. The CD is little more than meretricious fluff. Overall, there is really little more than you could find in any serious speech book or even website; it is simply dumbed down for modern college students.</span>

                    <span>I cannot stress the point that if this were not required for many college public speaking courses, Stephen E. Lucas would probably be writing greeting cards at best and at worst, the ingredient label on a tube of toothpaste!<BR>The author uses examples of persuasive speeches (with a liberal agenda) to a receptive (liberal) audience as his evidence that a well written, well delivered speech will influence the audience to the speakers view. Total cr^p! <P>I wouldnt have bought this if it wasnt a required text and I am happy to be selling this liberal trash to some other poor unsuspecting student. I wonder if the college gets kickbacks from the publishing houses.</span>

                    <span>For both beginning and advanced speakers -- really, anyone seeking to persuade others -- this is a FINE reference. The work is loaded with URLs and reference sources for research purposes. You'll definitely want to keep this book on the shelf within handy reach. The chapter on "Speaking to Persuade" is especially useful for getting commitment from others. I recommend the work particularly to business professionals who want good, solid advice on how to construct and deliver effective communications. In addition, the author has provided exceptionally well-integrated support materials to ensure proper understanding of the concepts. Teachers and trainers will find the bank of test materials and workshop exercises extremely helpful. Also, the CD presents highlights from such outstanding speakers as Barbara Bush, John F. Kennedy, Elizabeth Dole and Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.</span>
