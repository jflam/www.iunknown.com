                    <span>I recently took my Developer test and failed.  :(  I have been designing and programming in Flash for close to 2 years now, and while I found this book to be a great source for overall A.S. training, it really didn't prep me for the exam.  There was very little in the book that actually reflected the level or detail the exam demanded.  Understanding Macromedia has since changed the exam after this book was published, I still wish there was a way the publishers of this book could offer provide its owners some materials on the updated exam and its new expectations.</span>

                    <span>I'm one of the co-authors of this book.  I would like to address the discrepancies some reviewers have noted between the book and the exam.<p>We were contracted to write this book and were given a general structure of what topics needed to be covered, and to what extent.  This structure was intended to match that of the exam.  We followed these guidelines as closely as possible and wrote the best book we could based on the many criteria we were given.<p>From what I can tell, at some point after the book went to press Macromedia changed the structure of the exam.  Subjects that had only comprised a small amount of the text were now major portions of the exam and vice versa.  There was nothing we could do but hope that the well-rounded approach we chose for teaching AS would still cover the exam material well as well as help potential test takers identify areas of weakness in their experience.<p>As has been pointed out in other reviews, the book provides good overall coverage of ActionScripting complete with solid code examples.  I still believe it would be a handy resource for someone considering taking the exam, although it can no longer be considered a complete reference.</span>

                    <span>Although I did learn some new terminology and have a more thorough understanding of ActionScript (1.0), this book did not adequately prepare me for the Certification exam.  I do recommend that someone buy this book, in addition to some ActionScripting "How To" book that gets you submerged in programming AS and using the debugger tool A LOT MORE!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>First of all, this book was created because Macromedia Flash certification is getting more respect and the desire to obtain certification is growing. Because of the lack of example exams and general knowledge on what to expect people are hungry for a good study guide.<p>This is not a good study guide. It covers the easy topics with great detail. It talks about things that don't show up on the exam (i.e. good coding style). It skips over more difficult topics and suggests that the reader find a good reference. <p>I recommend that you read Colin Moock's reference, then if you want a good study guide download the test outline from Macromedia and buy the condensed pocket reference to Mr. Moock's book. <p>Study, and practice and you're sure to pass. Just don't expect much from this book.</span>

                    <span>Buyer beware: this book is a good overview of the topics you need to know. But your time would be well spent with Colin Moock's book as well. In addition the practice test on the books related web site is nowhere near as difficult as the real thing.<p>There are some very good code samples in this book that will benefit even the most seasoned Flash MX developer. They are woth the purchase alone.</span>
