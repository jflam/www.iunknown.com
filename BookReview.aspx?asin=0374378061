                    <span>    Noreen runs away from her boyfriend and sketchy pass taking her boyfriend's truck and savings with her. What she finds is a reality check-she's pregnant!- and a quiet town with nice people who make her realize she needs to grow up. Can she do it before she completely ruins everyone around her's life? What about her own child? 
<br />    Noreen is a lot like the average teen-she's not perfect, her family's not normal, and she can't seem to make the right decions about love. Many teen girls could probabily relate to Noreen. Although I've never done some of things Noreen has, I know people who have. This book is a story that brings confusion, love, and hope all into light.
<br />    If you like real life stories that are stright forward and not always all happy-go lucky you'll like this book. The part I liked about this book was it wasn't written to be all mushy and happy. This book was real and real life isn't all mushy and happy. My least favorite part of the book was the ending. If there was one thing I could change it would be the ending. I would recommend this book to someone who likes to read a lot, because then after they read the book's ending they don't figure it as a complete waste of time. Bottom Line: This girl need not confess!</span>

                    <span>Do you ever feel that no matter what you do it turns out wrong?  Did you make a big mistake years ago, and it still haunts you?  Do your good intentions just make a bigger mess?  Well join the crowd in this book.  Noreen Stall is 17 years old, and a veritable Tasmanian Devil of disaster.  Misfortune and accidents flash off her like a 4th of July sparkler.  Arriving in the small town of Pembina Lake marks a turning point in her life.  The people there recognize themselves in her, and remember their youthful misjudgments.  In trying to help Noreen, and set her on the right path, they start to heal their own pain.  And when Noreen decides to stop running away, she discovers pride and satisfaction in making reparations.  This time, her spark kindles hope.  A little gem of a book for young adults. </span>

                    <span>Even when Noreen Stall has the best intentions, it seems that she screws everything up. And when she makes so many mistakes that she starts to hate herself, she runs from the people who love her. When she runs away from her boyfriend, taking his truck, money and unborn baby, she finds herself in the small town of Pembina Lake. There she lands in the rundown café owned by Lynda Bradley, a single mother of a three-year-old boy, Seth. Lynda is struggling to make sense of a life that could have been so much more. She lets Noreen stay the night and, in doing so, unleashes a series of events that force the people in the town to take a look at their own lives.
<br /> 
<br /> When Dolores Harper, who has a gift for helping people, hears about Noreen, she decides to get her to talk. But while she is helping Noreen open up, she can't see that her "oldest friend in the world" might need her support as well. During her stay at Pembina Lake, Noreen makes many more mistakes, including accidentally poisoning Seth's beloved dog and ripping out part of the wall in the café while trying to remove the fading, ugly wallpaper. Will she run again, or decide to stay?
<br /> 
<br /> The characters you meet in this book are real and unforgettable. Watching them help each other along gave me a satisfying feeling.

                    <span>The story begins with Noreen being taken in by a cafe owner Lynda after she has a falling out with her boyfriend. After being coaxed by one of Lynda's friends, Dolores, and the whole story falls out, how Noreen didnt like here step dad and turned 'bad' so moved in with her newlywed step sister, where she still acts the same. She runs away from home with boyfriend Brandon , to return home with Wesely, where she get in a fight with her sister, to just move in with Wesely, who adores her. Well Noreen becomes bored and starts using Wesely's saved up money. They have a fight and she runs away with 700 of his dollars, his car, and his future child. And she now finds herself in the present story living in a cafe in a small town. To blinded by their ego the two split only to think about each other often while away. The two come together several times but after the third or so the two (well Noreen) realize their love for each other and everyone gets their happy ending. Im rating it three stars because this story was just so.. Boring.. The story seemed to drag on, and Noreen's heartless behavior made you want to smack her one. But hey! if you like this book,good for you, its what ever floats your boat.</span>
