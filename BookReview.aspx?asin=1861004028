                <span id="Label1">Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) and the Extensible Markup Language  (XML) are two of the hottest Web technologies, but each, because it is a complex  topic in its own right, usually is documented individually. <I>Professional ASP  XML</I> ties the two together in an important way, illustrating how to utilize  them both to produce next-generation Web applications.<p>  This product of several Wrox authors shows how and where XML fits in with ASP  development, and whets the reader's appetite for creative solutions to typical  data-handling problems. Because the focus of the book is a step beyond the XML  specification itself, the basics of XML are covered up front in a quick and  practical discussion. The authors do a great job of explaining the Document  Object Model, as well as the DTD-versus-schema controversy. Then it's on to the  fun stuff: a look at how to build XSL style sheets dynamically from a database,  bind XML data locally with data islands, and construct a component that  encapsulates reusable XML file operations.<p>  The best way to grasp the power of XML, however, is to see it in action.  Fortunately, the authors devote a large portion of the book to case studies that  use XML in various ways: to drive an online survey system, generate programmer  documentation for DLLs, represent a shopping cart, and serve as the glue behind  a workflow application. If you're developing for the Web, sooner or later you  will find XML either useful or necessary. This book should be required reading  for any serious ASP developer. <I>--Stephen W.

                    <span>The chapters are laid out properly and are easy to understand. It helped us to learn a great deal about incorporating XML into ASP.We recommend this book to anyone who wants to further expand their knowledge of XML in ASP.The authors did a really good job on explaing XML for ASP developers.The depth explainations of the case studies & examples and XML are really great and relate to real world examples.The chapter explaining about the SOAP is really good which helped us a lot personally to implement an in my current project . We personally thank Dinar Dalvi for his help and support to answer our questions and immediate feedback for our emails.</span>

                    <span>I would be unfair to say that the 883 pages were a total waste, but it wasn't worth it for me.<P>The title of the Book is "ASP XML", and from this title I choose this book, because I wanted a book that would help me to use XML in ASP. That wasn't the case in some of the book examples.<P>The book content (without the case study) is only 15 chapter that spans 366 pages covering all different aspects of XML and XML integration of ASP. The information presented is very basic and lacks basic knowledge of XML, for example XSL was covered very poorly in the book ( MSDN was more helpful to me than the book). Chapter 11 through 14 were very useful though, especially chapter 14 that covers useful XML procedure libraries.<P>The case studies spans around 180 pages, there are 6 case studies. They were very confusing to me and none of them helped me solving any of the business requirements I was tackling.<P>The rest of the book contains appendices that are useful to have them all in the same book, but you can get them over the Internet for free.<P>Last word to say is that I was disappointed with this book.</span>

                    <span>I'm a big fan of the WROX publications (for ASP in particular), but this book was a disappointment. The writing was choppy - as you might expect from a book with 14 guys on the cover. The examples were cryptic and raise more questions than they answer. <P>The author(s) seem to me to be attempting to impress us (and each other) with their knowledge of the subject rather than really trying to write a digestible explanation of ways to utilize XML in an ASP environment.</span>
