                    <span>I am only one fourth way through the book. I am a doctor, not an IT professional and I wanted a book that teaches me database design from no knowledge to some sound base and as I go though the book, I am amazed. This book is really for the uninitiated and for the bigwigs in access as well. I got going to write the review by just reading the first few pages and I am sure this will turn out to be the final reference for all those seasoned access developers out there. John really does justice to his designation of "MVP" (Microsoft's Most Valuable Professional) in this book. He has been also very kind enough to help me out with designing my applications. 
<br />
<br />I have one grouch though. I wish there was a book or maybe John would be kind enough to add another CD or section where he would leave a few practice applications for us to develop for ourselves and compare with his way of developing, this gives a hands on experience, which I find a must for novices like us.
<br />
<br />A MUST BUY I must say, if you really want to ACCESS your needs for database designa and Access!!

                    <span>For being nearly 1300 pages, this book is barely sufficient. While there is plenty of information, the book is poorly organized with sparse and general headings followed by paragraphs of wordy explanatory text. A better use of headings and sub headings would allow for better reference.
<br />
<br />Turning for help in the index is also disappointing. The book is poorly indexed and seems to have been given little thought or personal attention to its organization.
<br />
<br />The last place to turn is to code samples, but these are so sparse and abbreviated that you have to search for them among pages of text. I'm all for having copies of the code on the accompanying CD, but for even a neophyte, sample code is essential to grasping all the detail.
<br />
<br />I feel sympathetic that the author obviously spent a prodigious amount of time writing 1300 pages of prose, but the bottom line for technology books is that you need to show me, not just tell me about it.</span>

                    <span>The intended audience for this book isn't someone who just needs to use a Microsoft Access Database. Instead, this book is for someone who knows Access basics and understands databases and wants to create their own database - or perhaps their own application - including possibly using Visual Basic programming or macros. If this is you, then this book is GREAT! Doesn't bother you with the tiny details, but gives you what you need to get moving on your project, including how to prevent users from tinkering with your form design, how to fine tune your database/application using the performance analyzer, and other ideas to put together a high-quality database or application. (The reason why some reviewers have rated the book lower, is that they were probably outside the targeted audience, and the material was therefore less appropriate for them.)</span>

                    <span>As the review title says, this is a big book - one that is chockful of tips, examples and code (on the included CD) that will reveal the power and ease-of-use that Microsoft Access 2003 possesses. As another reviewer stated, the examples are not the same, old tired Northwind database but fresh and exciting looking examples created by the author.  Everyone - from beginner to advanced users - will find something in this book.  And the big plus is the SQL information in the book and on the CD.<p>This book is well thought out, well written and, well, just a darn good buy.  I don't think you can go wrong with this one.  I know that I won't.</span>

It includes lots of screen shots and descriptions of why things need to be done the recommended way. It also has good technical detail for the more advanced user. Following the procedures in this book will definitely improve your database application.</span>
