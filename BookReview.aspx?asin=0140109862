                <span id="Label1">At the age of 38, John D. MacArthur, a destitute high-school dropout, borrowed $2,500 to buy the Bankers Life & Casualty Company of Chicago; eight years later he'd made a million dollars. At the time of his death in 1978 he was the second-richest man in America and "notoriously tightfisted." But he left most of his two-and-a-half-billion-dollar estate in the form of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, with only these instructions to his board of trustees: "I figured out how to make the money, you boys figure out how to spend it." Thus the MacArthur Prize, also known as the "genius grant," was born. The award cannot be applied for, and it is not limited to any particular field of interest. Its purpose "is to promote those leaps of creative thinking that may occur when gifted people are left to their own devices." For <I>Uncommon Genius</I>, Shekerjian interviewed forty MacArthur Prize winners--John Sayles, Peter Sellars, Ellen Stewart, and Derek Walcott among them--in an attempt to discover "how great ideas are born." While much of what she learns about the creative impulse is not exactly groundbreaking--it involves risk-taking, openness, concentration, resiliency, and a great love of the work--spending time with the creators she has chosen to include is fascinating. They bring these broad concepts to life by inviting us into their studios, offices, labs, even dorm rooms (the youngest interviewee, Mayan epigraphist David Stuart, was a Princeton student at the time) and discussing their own creative processes. There is much to be gleaned here, not only about how creativity applies itself to various fields (community action, political science, writing, art history, woodworking, and even being a clown), but about how to nurture your own "creative genius." <I>--Jane Steinberg</I></span>

                    <span>Uncommon Genius is a wonderful book that allows us to peek into the creative minds of winners of the famous MacArthur prize. For this book, Shekerjian interviewed a large number of those who have won this prize, and takes us through in-depth examinations of what seems to make them tick creatively. <P>When I was writing Aha! - 10 Ways to Free Your Creative Spirit and Find Your Great Ideas, I read this book, and the different perspectives that Shekerjian shares in this book, were instrumental in helping me develop some of the structure in my book. <P>This book goes way beyond what could have been an academic exercise in personality exploration. The author is an excellent writer, and as we read about each of these creative individuals, we feel like we actually get to know them. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to gain a better understanding of what makes the creative individual think, or anyone who would just enjoy reading about some highly creative individuals.</span>

                    <span>The author of this book tracked down and interviewed 40 recipients of the McArthur "genius award." This award is a cash grant given to creative people in many different fields; it enables them to work on, or not work on, whatever they please and not have to worry about money. <P>There was much about the creative process in this book that was new to me. Reading interviews with people who use the process every day is a lot different than reading about creativity in a "how to be creative" book. You get more of a sense of the range of ways people produce outstanding work. Shekerjian introduces us to people who are not only in the arts, but also science, teaching, ecology and conservation, political science, social services, and other fields. Many of these people are extremely quirky, and there's a lesson in that: trying to be like others, and be liked, is not the way to uncover your potential.<P>Shekerjian's prose is conversational and easy to read. However, at times I found it to be overly flowery and thus distracting. There were many involved descriptions of interview settings, which seemed superfluous. I found myself doing a lot of skimming to get to the core subject matter. On the whole, though, it's a well-written book, by an author who is clearly in love with her subject matter.</span>

                    <span>What a wonderful, specific little book this is. I wish there were more like it! Ms. Shekerjian has interviewed men and women in various fields of study and art (and who share the honor of being MacArthur recipients)to give us insight into the pursuit of the creative idea, the spark that leads certain people to persist through failure, to bring the 'next big thing' into being. Ms. Shekerjian should be applauded for stepping back and letting the voices of her interviewees speak, rather than preaching to us on her findings. Again, a terrific book, I wish there were more like this!</span>
