                <span id="Label1">Written for intermediate and advanced programmers, this book builds on your existing knowledge to teach you exactly what you need to know to develop .NET applications.  Packed full of practical examples, the book presents a case study which takes you through the design of an application "engine" and its implementation as a .NET assembly. You'll reuse the engine to create different versions of the application using Windows Forms, Remoting, Web Services, Windows Services, COM, MSMQ, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and the Mobile Web SDK. You'll also learn about fundamental .NET concepts such as types and assemblies and develop a simple language compiler which can emit a .NET executable.  Also included is an appendix containing a comprehensive introduction to the C# programming language. </span>

                    <span>I have not read a good book like this in a long time. I like to learn fast and hence was looking for a book which could give me a clear picture of what's going on. The book is very concise and to the point, very readable and has great examples. There is no mumbo-jumbo. I would suggest this book to both beginners and experts. Gives a very wide and clear picture of today's tiered application programming. I am new to the Microsoft's 'hidden and obscure' world of programming and this book is giving me a sigh of relief.</span>

                    <span>Thank You Fergal, for a "steady pen" in writing "Microsoft .NET for Programmers". The use of a FUN case study (Poker client-server) to synergize understanding of .NET principles in a "real-life" application is a boon to communicating such a vast subject.<p>Though this book seems geared to other than beginners (in both C# and .NET), starting at page 1, reading and doing the examples, and maintaining a steady course until the last page, is sure to "enlighten" the .NET inquiring mind. A more global perspective and understanding of this large subject is pretty much guaranteed.<p>One foot in front of the other, put yourself through the paces: Buy the book, download the files, read the prolific and responsive author participation list on Manning, read and practice from cover to cover. Your programming skills in .NET will be enhanced enjoyably for all future .NET ventures. As a bonus, you'll go to sleep at night without that large and uneasy .NET question mark look on your face.</span>

                    <span>I've been through many of the C# books, some from Microsoft Press, and some from O'Reilly, and on and on.<br>For beginners there is no clear winner. However, for experienced programmers looking to expand their knowledge into many of the more advanced areas of C#, I recommended Grimes book, Microsoft .NET for Programmers.<p>It's for intermediate to advanced, and it's quite a bit of fun working through the example that builds and builds upon an engine, adding many interfaces, where each interface exploits a particular area of .Net. Plus he throws in his years of programming expertise to add in lots of programming tricks that also highlight .Net's flexibility and ease of programming.<p>Do svidanija - moi tovarischi!</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best technical books I have read. It takes a very large subject and distills it down to a concise and manageable text. <br>    Each chapter takes you further into .Net in a fast paced yet very well-explained way. The poker game developed in the book is also fun to play with and enhance.<br>    This is a must-read text. However, read an introductory book first.</span>
