                    <span>This book had an awesome message behind it.  What a lot of people aren't doing these days is going for their dreams and what a lot of people are doing is giving up.  This speech influenced me so much and probably other people too.  I recomend this to pre teens and teens and adults as well because they can relate to Bill Veeck.</span>

                    <span>When I was 10, I wrote Bill Veeck (then owner of the Chicago White Sox) a letter . . . I recall making suggestions as to the club's lineup . . . not only did he write me back, but his response marked the beginning of an occasional series of back-and-forth correspondence that continued until his death . . . . . . he even made my an honorary<br>White Sox scout and arranged for me to meet one of his real scouts when I attended a Mets game.<p>Veeck thus became my first guru . . . he was a baseball promoter, perhaps most famous for having sent a midget to bat in a major league game . . . but he was also an innovator, plus quite a guy.<p>I devoured his autobiography, VEECK AS IN WRECK, when<br>it was published in 1981 . . . since then, I have attempted to<br>read everything else I could about him . . . yet somehow I<br>had missed MARKETING YOUR DREAMS: BASEBALL AND <br>LIFE LESSONS FROM BILL VEECKs by Pat Willaims; i.e., until this past week.<p>My one word reaction: WOW! . . . what a great book . . . it<br>made me appreciate Veeck even more, along with Williams--quite<br>a sports promoter in his own right . . . I found myself taking<br>countless notes, always a sign that what I'm reading is <br>really making quite a dent on me.<p>There were many memorable passages; among them:<br>* Because there is a reason why Veeck went<br>to bed in the middle of the night. And a reason<br>why he woke up four hours later. And a reason<br>why he was never dulled by routine, why every<br>day became an opportunity, and every hour,<br>every moment of his 71 years, was gilded and<br>precious.<p>He did not sleep because he could not sleep.<br>He was afraid to sleep because sleeping<br>meant missing something. He was so caught<br>up in the basest virtues of each day that his<br>mind couldn't let go.<p>Said Washington writer Tom Boswell after<br>Veeck's passed away in 1986, "Cause of <br>death: Life."<p>"With the amount of sleep he didn't get," says<br>longtime Chicago White Sox organist Nancy<br>Faust, "Bill probably died at 85 instead of 71."<p>* Veeck once sent away for a mail-order toy. When<br>it arrived, he learned it had to be assembled. He<br>spent the entire night before Christmas attempting<br>to put that infernal toy together for one of his <br>children. When he sent his check to the manufacturer,<br>he tore it into tiny pieces, put them into an envelope<br>and wrote: "I put your toy together. You put my<br>check together."<p>No doubt he felt a burden lifted.<p>The manufacturer had no choice but to accept the<br>check.<p>* He called amputees in the hospital to console them.<br>("Look at it this way," he would say. "One pair of socks<br>will last you twice as long. And in the winter, only one <br>foot will get cold.") He told one fan whose leg was wrapped<br>in a heavy brace, "If I had another leg to give you, I would."<br>He demonstrated the leg to curious children. He consoled<br>an amateur softball player who had broken his leg, <br>slipping the wooden leg off and telling him, "Here. Use mine."<p>"I only fear two things," he'd say, brandishing the leg. "Fire <br>and termites."<p>And though I typically like to include only three passages,<br>I just had to include this one too:<p>* Soon after the funeral, Mary Frances was digging<br>through the house when she discovered a note. They'd<br>always written to each other for more than three decades;<br>notes of love and sentimentality and humor. Seems he'd<br>written this one while waiting to be taken to the hospital<br>for the last time.<p>On one side he'd expressed the depth of his love for<br>Mary Frances. On the other, he'd written, "Tell everyone<br>it has been lots of fun."<p>You'll also find this book to be a lot of fun, as well as <br>inspirational.</span>

                    <span>At the beganing of the novel I couldn't really get into the read, but as I continued reading I found out some of the people that met Bill Veeck always had something good to say about him, as far as his work and some of his business partners our conserned.</span>

                    <span>The author, Pat Williams, an administrator with the Orlando Magic of the NBA, has chosen former baseball owner Bill Veeck as his example in what you can do to improve yourself.  Veeck was a self-educated man who was a voracious reader of books and used promotions to sell his product, in his case tickets to his team's baseball games.  Important tips are given for people to follow in expressing interest in another person and what they have to say along with steps to follow in being an effective public speaker. Veeck was a person who had time for everyone he came in contact with and enjoyed his life to the fullest.  He was a very down-to-earth individual who enjoyed tweaking baseball's establishment of stuffed shirts.  The book is filled with great quotations and stories of those who were befriended by Veeck during his ownership of major league teams in Cleveland, St. Louis, and Chicago.  His training ground was with the Milwaukee Brewers, then a minor league team of which he was the owner.  I have read and enjoyed all the Veeck books:  Veeck As In Wreck, The Hustler's Handbook, Thirty Tons A Day, and Bill Veeck:  A Baseball Legend in addition to this latest effort by Pat Williams.  We continue to influence people after we die through those whose lives we touched when we were alive.  Even though Bill Veeck is no longer with us, he can help you improve yourself by reading this book.  It will be entertaining as well.</span>
