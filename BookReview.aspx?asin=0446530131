                    <span>I loved this book!! I initially picked it up and just skimmed throught it, which is very rewarding and fun anyway because the tidbits of info and the wonderful Victorian pictures are just incredible! BUt one quiet afternoon, i finally sat down with the book and began reading it from page one!! And when I was finished, not only did I have such a healthy respect for the way our forebears lived, it also inspired me to create a much more wholesome and warm home for my own family. and thank GOd, I don't need to use lye to wash my husband's smelly socks in, but believe it or not, many of the old household hints are relevant today. IN fact, with all the health concerns about the chemicals we use to clean with everyday and how harmful they are not only to ourselves but the environment, I actually bought a six pack of Baking Soda at the discount store to use for the myriad of ways Mrs. Dunwoody recommends. A timeless book of timeless treasures and timeless wisdom!! Makes you wish for simplier times!! I recommend it to anyone wishing to make their house more of a HOME!!</span>

                    <span>This book is the kind one buys for sisters, friends, family, teachers, weddings, birthdays, and anyone that wants to make a house a home. (I bought extras for my gift closet.) The fill-in pages at the end of each chapter personalize it and make it a treasure book for the family, something you would want to pass down to the younger generations. <BR>The words are timeless, like a long lost great-aunt encouraging and rooting for the reader. Yes, the nuts and bolts of keeping house are there, but the real charm of this book is the way the author encourages the reader to find the sacred in the ordinary and every day. I love the charm, wit, and wisdom and the fact that I can pick it up and read from any page and carry something away with me. (I love books like that in my chaotic life!) I think this timeless book will be around for a long while and become a classic, much like The Joy of Cooking.</span>

                    <span>Though Mrs. Dunwoody hails from the past, her advice--with the exception of the whitewash recipe--is timeless. This book is a great encouragement to those who long for well-kept home. The book is funny with enough amusing details from our foremothers (see whitewash recipe) to keep them human while reminding us of what was so great about grandmother's house. Helpful, amusing, and tender as a mother's touch. You've got to get it!</span>
