                <span id="Label1">One of the most popular features of National Public Radio's <i>Weekend Edition Sunday</i> broadcasts have been the seven minutes of puzzling with puzzlemaster Will Shortz. Shortz, former editor of <i>Games</i> magazine and now crossword editor for the <i>New York Times,</i> has compiled 200 of the show's best word games into this collection. About half are short puzzles that may take a bit of thinking to solve. The other half are word games with 10 to 20 parts to work through. Can you find a common, unhyphenated English word that contains all but one of the letters L through V? Can you tell what barbers, roosters, and beehives have in common? How many boys' names can you find concealed in a dime? Will Shortz has scores of such challenges; even faithful listeners of <i>Weekend Edition Sunday</i> may find many of them worth resolving. Those who haven't heard these on-air presentations will find them a welcome source of puzzling entertainment. Shortz is highly skilled at finding and concocting puzzles that are fun, challenging, and amusing.  </span>

                    <span>If you listen to Will Shortz on Sunday's Weekend Edition, you know what kind of puzzles are in this volume. Half the puzzles are of the type that he conducts with a call-in listener. This usually involves a series of word puzzles with short answers you can come up with on the spot. The other half of the puzzles in The Puzzlemaster Presents are of the sort that he leaves us with to solve during the week. They are harder and have one correct answer. <p>The first type of puzzle is fun, but the second type is my favorite because you usually have to do these in your head. I like to keep one or two in mind for occasions like being stuck in traffic or standing in line. They really make the time fly and you don't need pencil and paper. I find they are also great if you have trouble getting to sleep. Concentrating on a tricky word puzzle or arithmetic calculation sure keeps your mind from wandering all over the place.<p>And don't look for clever tricks with these puzzles. One thing about Will Shortz is that even though he loves puzzles, he is scrupulously fair. He gives you all the information you will need to solve each problem.</span>

                    <span>As a fan of Will Shortz's other puzzle books I was eager to try the puzzles in this volume. There is a good variety ranging from fairly easy to extremely challenging puzzles. The topics are varied with both puzzles and answers presented in an easy to use format. Many puzzle books do not provide adequate space to properly fill in your answers but this book does.</span>

                    <span>Will Shortz has delighted puzzle lovers world-wide for years. This collection is another excellent offering from the man who has dedicated his life to the pleasure of solving puzzles.If you have neither listened to  Will's radio show nor purchased this book,you're missing out on a great  opportunity to have a good deal of challenging fun. I still get a kick (  and feel honored) when Will features one of my puzzles on his show because  of the way he makes it come to life with his enthusiasm. If you don't know  by now, Will Shortz is the master of wordplay. Do yourself, friends, and  family a favor. Get this book for hours of good,clean-cut fun and then tune  in his show on NPR for more.</span>
