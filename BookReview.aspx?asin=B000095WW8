                    <span>Tears of the Sun was a riveting and gripping action movie. It featured some understated by yet good performances by Bruce Willis. Director Antoine Fuqoa does another great job here like he did with the critically acclaimed and oscar winning Training Day. Tears of the Sun was a little flawed and somewhat monotonous and tedious but it certainly had its moments. As for the battle sequences, which unfortunately there aren't many of but well they are occasionally enthralling and intense. For the first though I honestly bored like hell, I wondered gee why did I come here? Within the last 30 minutes of the film, there was a fairly good battle sequence. <BR> The plot of the film is simple. Bruce Willis plays a commander and he heads an elite Marine unit to rescue a doctor named Dr. Lena Hendrix played by gorgeous Monica Bellucini and two nuns. Unfortunately Lena will not leave unless the 70 refugees under her care are transported to rescue as well. The tough decision comes and the film takes on an interesting path from here on out. Of course you can guess which decision he makes and he's of course got trouble on his hands. Rebel soliders are on his tail, and the transportaion of villagers is costing them valuable time. Bruce Willis of course does his "Die Hard" act and basically saves the day, a surprise right? Don't get me wrong, I personally like Bruce Willis, he's a fine actor, just it gets a little banal when knowing what's going to happen. Tears of the Sun features good action, but I wish there could've been a bit more. <BR> Tears of the Sun is rated R for Strong War Violence, Some Brutality and Language. The violence isn't excessive, but is occasionally gory, but usually not graphic by R standards. Horrible atrocities are shown and depicted of rebel soldiers beating and raping Nigerian villagers, but are not extensive. <BR>I would not highly recommend this film, but I surely would recommend it, for it's enjoyable seeing it, but once is enough. Trust me on that.</span>

                    <span>Bruce Willis stars in the action-adventure film 'Tears of the Sun'. Willis plays Lt. Waters who is in charge of a S.E.A.L.s team on a routine rescue mission. They are sent in to save a American doctor of a Nigerian mission from rebels that are causing devastation across the country. Unfortunately Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) talks Lt. Waters into taking the people that she is caring for in her mission. We find that Lt. Waters takes on more to the mission then just a simple rescue. He finds that he cares more and more for the people of the mission instead of having a heart of steal. "Tears of the Sun" is about what happens when we do the right thing instead of doing nothing at all. Without the protection of the S.E.A.L.s protection the refugees would have been massacred. <P>The movie jumps right into the action skipping character development. We learn about the characters during the mission. I found that the movie was exciting to watch but due to the lack of character development in the beginning it takes a while to get comfortable with the movie. <P>The plot of the movie is intriguing to me. Lt. Water becomes a hero in this fictitious story because he defies specific orders and puts his life and the lives of his team at risk to save many lives that were otherwise not his responsibility. <P>I give the movie a 4 out of 5 subtracting one point for the slow character development. Some of the reviews bash Willis for his role in the movie, I didn't think he did a bad job. Again you just have to wonder if the professional movie critics are watching the same movie as the rest of us.</span>

                    <span>You can't really call "Tears of the Sun" a bad movie. By any account it's certainly a decent action war movie, and I enjoyed it. Where "Tears of the Sun" fails to succeed is in it's somewhat one-dimensional and shallow aproach at including policical and social messages, and in it's seeming impotence at crossing the lines from mediocrity to greatness.<P>The plot is pretty much a no brainer that gets set up right from the get-go. The Democratic government in Nigeria gets ousted by a military coup and rebel forces execute the presidential family and begin an genocidal killing spree, killing christians and rival tribes. Bruce willis and his small special forces team is sent to to find and evacuate several US Citizens, including a doctor working at a christian mission. The doctor wont leave without her patients, and so Willis and his team agree to escort the people to the Cameroon border. Of course they are followed by the rebels the whole way and are grossly outnumbered and it becomes a race to get to the border and to safety before they are completely over run.<P>Not exactly full of surprises and not much food for thought. of course there is the initial lie/double cross, and then the classic (not to mention very cliche) moment where our heroes grow a conscience after witnessing the horrors and extent of ethnic cleansing that is taking place and decide to help the people as thier way of making amens with thier own guilty consciences. other than this there is little to talk about plot-wise.<P>The acting is pretty good, although it varies throughout. Willis himself does a very good job playing his charcter though other than him and the doctor none of the characters grew on me. The setting is great, and the shots of the african landscape were very nice. For being an action war movie, "Tears of the Sun" offered only sporadic action until the climatic battle at the end which was mildy impressing, though nothing you havent scene before.<P>There is a constant attempt throughout the movie to bring attention to the brutality the ethnic cleansing that occurs in Africa that most americans are unaware of. We hear about bosnia, kosovo, but not so much about the many war torn regions in africa many of which are subject to constant guerilla warfare, famine, tribal clashes, and civil wars. The current attention being given to the situation in Sudan is very similar to what is shown in the movie. The look we are given however, although sad and mildly graphic, is a little one dimensional, and doesnt really explore the complexity of the political, ethnic, and religious angles of african conflicts. instead this is all reduced to "good guys vs bad guy" with the US as the good guys who sit idley by of course. I think many people will wish that the movie had a more realistic and more complete look at this angle of the plot rather than just showin "a bunch of rebel guys in red hats who run around killing all the christians and guys from the other tibes".<P>Other than that there is an overwhelming lack of depth and substance to the movie. Character development was underdone and there just arent many layers beyond what you see on the surface. And what is on the surface, though not bad, is not spectacular either. While I liked the movie over all, it just didnt have enough meat to it I felt. There were times I would just feel like something I couldnt put my finger on was missing to this one. <P>"Tears of the sun" does win points however for atleast trying to shed some public light to the attrocities in africa that most of the world lives happily ignorant to. It also serves as an effective, and enjoyable military action movie that is hard to hate but impossible to love.</span>

                    <span>I really have quite ambivalent felings about this movie. From one hand, it's full of cliches and very simpleminded. You pretty much know what will happen, a lot of things are overdramatized (not the scenes of atrocities though). The acting is mediocre but it's not a problem of actors but rather of a bad script. On the other hand, the scenes of atrocities in the movie (somewhere in Africa - Sudan comes right away to mind) make people to realize that such terrible things are really happening today. It did really resonate through probably some shock - at least that's the way I feel. And who knows, maybe a simplemindness of this movie helps to deliver the message. I would give one star for cinematographic qualities and five stars for revealing the problem and showing disasters really happening in the world today.</span>

                    <span>Rent it when you've seen the better combat stories. Well I had high hopes for this one at the theater, and the first half was good enough. Then on the second half the whole "reality" of the movie fell through. If you ever read any real SEAL stories you will wonder what happened at the end. Bad tactics, bad acting, and just poor story. They all died about the start of the "big battle", somehow walking out in the B-movie end. Total science fiction. Sorry, that was just too much. And Why? No one to write a realistic script? Ran out of ideas? What a waste for the budget and huge effort. Thats my take. BlackHawk down Was a good movie though!</span>
