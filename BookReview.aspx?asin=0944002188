                    <span>Here's a man who believes that humans are just little pawns in the economy, and that, essentially, Mammon is God. And wouldn't it be appropriate for such a man to quote Charles Darwin in building his little argument that all of us are here merely as minions to the economic forces? So he does, as follows: "It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change" (page 60).<P>This Price Pritchett fella spends his writing time convincing us that our essence is found in what we contribute to the economy, and then his last sentence, the very last in this little book, reads as follows: "And let's enjoy the ride."<P>But it can't be both ways. If we endeavor to really enjoy ourselves, we may conflict with the purposes of the economy. If we really dedicate ourselves to the economy, we may not particularly enjoy it. Price Pritchett is talking out of two sides of his mouth. And why shouldn't he? Mammon is is his God, and Mammon has served him well. He's trying to convince the rest of us that we should go along with Mammon's program. I prefer the real God, myself: I don't know what or who that is, but I know what it ain't, and it ain't Mammon.<P>This little pamphlet does have some interesting statistics. Thus it merits a two.

                    <span>Today's corporate managers will be in charge, at least once & probably many, many times during their tenure, of major changes in policy, strategy, & practice. Unfortunately, more often than not, these changes fail to accomplish some or all of their objectives. In this brief book, Pritchett explains why employees resist change and lays out several novel & effective methods to meet their resistance head on and win them over to the change effort (He also addresses the "troublesome few" who absolutely refuse to accept change, & how to best marginalize them and their attempts to stop the change). All employees will benefit from the lessons in "Resistance," but any manager in charge of a change effort **must** have this book to help him/her overcome the barriers standing in the way of the new & improved organization that will result from the change.</span>

                    <span>Pritchett puts forth a masterful thesis: When plants close, companies merge, & products go off the market, it's not "foreigners" or "the government" to blame. It's **us**. **We** as consumers are the ones driving the (incredibly quickly) changing market because **we**, as a group, are out for one thing -- the best deal. That's why today we have Federal Express and not the Pony Express, and AT&T focuses a lot more on the "Telephone" aspects of the business than the "Telegraph" aspects. "Minsdshift" explains how employees today can adopt a number of new & important ways of thinking to keep themselves and their companies "shifting" their thinking to continually offer the best deal -- the one and only way companies will get consumers to stay with them. Extremely important reading not just for "front-line" employees, but also for anyone involved with the positioning and/or managing how a business treats its existing and potential new markets.</span>
