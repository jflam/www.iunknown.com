                <span id="Label1">Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this piercing work distills three thousand years of the history of power in to forty-eight well explicated laws. As attention--grabbing in its design as it is in its content, this bold volume outlines the laws of power in their unvarnished essence, synthesizing the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun-tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, and other great thinkers. Some laws teach the need for prudence ("Law 1: Never Outshine the Master"), the virtue of stealth ("Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions"), and many demand the total absence of mercy ("Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally"), but like it or not, all have applications in real life. Illustrated through the tactics of Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, P. T. Barnum, and other famous figures who have wielded--or been victimized by--power, these laws will fascinate any reader interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control.</span>

                    <span>This is a book which should be read and retained close by for immediate review. No judgement should be passed on the morality or immorality of this book - it merely states fact. <P>The authors have brought Machiavelli's "The Prince" into modern day, and have improved upon this classic work. While many believe that Machiavelli is the symbol of absolute ruthlessness, it is not disputed that his work is a classic and should be studied.<P>So too with "The 48 Laws of Power." The book is neither good, nor evil. It is a tool, a valuable tool which is available to be used for whatever purpose its reader chooses. If you are one of the multitude of corporate sociopaths which seem to be everywhere, you will enjoy the sage advice presented on how to prepare for your next feeding frenzy of innocent lives. On the same hand, everyone should read this book to at least be aware of the absolutely ruthless tactics which can be used against you. It is a two-edged, amoral sword. The reader must decide how this book suits their purpose.<P>I was so impressed with the book that I gave a copy of it to my son at college with the advice, "Read this and welcome to the real world." If anything, this book is similar to regulations. You only look at regulations when A) You are getting ready to burn somebody or B) Somebody is getting ready to burn you.<P>The authors have done us all a favor.</span>

                    <span>I am not earning over a million bucks a year so I might not be qualified to judge the value of the book. However, as somebody in his late thirties and always stuck in the middle of world class big corps, I can tell just knowing the laws can greatly improve your ability to defend against arrows shooting at your back. <P>For your easy reference, the laws are:-<BR>1. Never outshine the master<BR>2. Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies<BR>3. Conceal your intentions<BR>4. Always say less than necessary<BR>5. So much depends on reputation - guard it with your life<BR>6. Court attention at all cost<BR>7. Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit<BR>8. Make other people come to use - use bait if necessary<BR>9. Win thru your actions, neer thru argument<BR>10. Infection: Avoid the unhappy and unlucky<BR>11. Learn to keep people dependent on you<BR>12. Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim<BR>13. When asking for help, appeal to people's self interest, never to their mercy or gratitude<BR>14. Pose as a friend, work as a spy<BR>15. Crush your enemy totally<BR>16. Use absence to increase respect and honor<BR>17. Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability<BR>18. Do not build fortresses to protect yourself - isolation is dangerous<BR>19. Know who you are dealing with - do not offend the wrong person<BR>20. Do not commit to anyone<BR>21. Play a sucker to catch a sucker - seem dumber than your mark<BR>22. Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power<BR>23. Concentrate your forces<BR>24. Play the perfect courtier<BR>25. Re-create yourself<BR>26. Keep your hands clean<BR>27. Play on people's need to believe to create cultlike following<BR>28. Enter action with boldness<BR>29. Plan all the way to the end<BR>30. Make your accomplishments seem effortless<BR>31. Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal<BR>32. Play to people's fantasies<BR>33. Discover each man's thumbcrew<BR>34. Be royal in your own fashion; act like a king to be treated like one<BR>35. Master the art of timing<BR>36. Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge<BR>37. Create compelling spectacles<BR>38. Think as you like but behave like others<BR>39. Stir up waters to catch fish<BR>40. Despise the free lunch<BR>41. Avoid stepping into a great man's shoes<BR>42. Strike the shepherd and the sheep with scatter<BR>43. Work on the hearts and minds of others<BR>44. Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect<BR>45. Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once<BR>46. Never appear too perfect<BR>47. Do not go past the mark you aimed for: in victory, learn when to stop<BR>48. Assume formlessness<P>I hope you wont find the above "laws" too repugnant. Anyway, this book is well written with plenty of lively and interesting examples or stories. An excellent read for both leisure and self improvement, I must say. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>...is something for nothing.<P>Yes, it is possible to achieve financial success and political power using the laws in this book, but at what cost? I have read extensively on the principles that successful, powerful people both past and present have used to access power. The greatest people of all time have realized that unlike what Mr. Greene suggests, real, sustainable power comes from within--it cannot be had be had through the manipulation of external conditions, i.e. effects not causes. The most powerful people (some who used their power for good, others for not so good), accessed the power we all have WITHIN us.<P>My analysis has demonstrated to me that the only people who are able to become very powerful in business, politics and socially and yet still have excellent health, great relationships and above all PEACE OF MIND, accessed the power within. <P>I believe that all those who want to rise to positions of power and authority (and enjoy the associated benefits of such) yet still maintain good friendships, good marriages, have good health and peace of mind, should spend more time accessing the power within because this is the only power than enables one to "have it all".<P>This book was good because it enables those who live by certain ethical principles to identify and protect themselves against those ideas that are discussed (and very likely used) by many readers of this book.<P>I would recommend reading Joseph Murphy's book Power of The Subconscious Mind for a better understanding of the true source of power.</span>

                    <span>This book not only contradicts many tried-and-true methods of attaining power, but in the most inane way. If you followed the advice given, you would have no friends (as it advises stabbing them in the back when possible in order to make yourself look better--no joke). I was absolutely appalled at the unabashed odacity this book promulgates. If you subscribe to the Golden Rule, this book is not for you. It is my belief that if Jack Welch were to read this book, he'd laugh, and discredit everything the authors say. In addition to the above statement, this book advises: as long as you can get away with it--do it, reject loyalty to others, deception, etc. <P>It read like two high school geeks trying to sound "tough." Avoid this book at all costs, that is, assuming you are mature. I can tell you that this book will get you no where in life (other than backwards).</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In our world of political correctness and appearances, where society is depicted as fair, democratic, at times altruistic and transparent, the reality of the situation is far different. And as Greene proposes, no one wants to be seen as power hungry, and those that do, are generally scorned. Power is a game. And to play this game successfully, duplicity is the key: to win power, we must, on the surface, at least appear to be fair, altruistic and transparent, however we must scheme, manipulate, deceive, charm and seduce, if we are to get what we want...to achieve power, as Napoleon suggested, we should use an iron fist with a velvet glove, smiling as we stab our opponents in the back. Attaining power is war, though according to Greene, a civilized war. <P>Any person with an essential good nature should find this book a little disturbing. The message from Greene is clear - living the virtuous life is the road to failure and powerlessness. Appealing to the better angels of our natures is a lost cause and will get us nowhere but the bottom of the food chain. In other words, "nice guys finish last." The only way to the top is through treachery, seduction, observing others' weaknesses to then play on those weaknesses to your advantage. Greene's advice is basically a negative strategy to power and success. And to be sure, there are other positive strategies out there to attain power and success without resorting to deception and covert manipulation. But none are presented here.<P>That said, understanding the 48 laws presented here, at least will make us aware of the depths some people will go to in order to get what they desire. In this regard, this text is worth the time, energy and money.</span>
