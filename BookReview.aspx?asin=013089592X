                    <span>This is simply the best C reference in existance.  Both the index and the contents are perfectly useful and expertly implemented.  Whenever I'm coding this book lives on my desk.  To top it all off it is printed on very high quality thin paper - it's thin size belies the tresure trove of information within.  Everything you'd want to know is not only contained in its pages but most importantly can be found quickly.  Concise, accurate, readable.  The perfect resource.</span>
                  
                    <div class="CustomerReviewSummary">Great index! And great cut-to-the-chase!</div>

                    </div>
                    <span>A previous reviewer noted that there was no index entry for const. So, naturally this was the first thing I checked. It's there. Don't know what he was looking at. 
<br />
<br />This is a great book if you already know C and you just need the facts, with no instructional baggage for newbies. The book doesn't teach you C, but is rather quite possibly the best reference manual I've seen.</span>

                    <span>I can't count how many times this book has saved my life while coding. It's too easy to find a function, read a good description and a small but useful example.. great!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book gives a good listing of many of the functions in C.   I. personally, find it difficult to follow at times most likely because of my inexperence with programming in general. As I gain more experence I expect to be able to follow the refernces better. The are listing of functions that do not exist on all systems. So it seems fairly complete. For example. I wanted to play with the sleep function and discovered that it was not currently avalible.
<br />
<br />I gave this 3 stars instead of 5 because the binding is already coming apart. I bought this book new around a year ago here on Amazon and the binding is already coming apart. NOT GOOD!</span>
