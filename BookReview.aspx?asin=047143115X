                    <span>I thoroughly recommend this book! It is perfect for anyone who works with Solaris, Unix, or Sun hardware. There are tidbits for everyone. For me, I found the chapter on the E10K the most interesting. Since I only work with the lower enterprise machines, I was fascinated by the descriptions of what administering and working with 10K's were like. As for technical details, I'd probably look through other books. (Manuals from Sun would work.) This book gives a lot of general guidance on how systems should be run and what administrators should concern themselves with (i.e. security issues- tcp wrappers, tripwire, etc.). They definitely know what they are talking about. As for who should read it... Well, I think most System Admins should read it for learning what path they should take to make life easier. As for other people, it's a good reference on what professional admins should be doing.</span>

                    <span>Understand Unix and want to dig deeper into Solaris Admin? Then this is the book for you. I love this book--it is my new bible and I study it every chance I get. Well written. I had been using Unix for a long time but was weak in Sys Admin. Partly because I didn't have a good reference. Without a knowledge of the boot process, diaganostic tools, I felt I had a major weakness in this area. I looked around for a book that would fill this need and was very happy to find this book. I especially liked the chapter on setting up an Internet site. <P>I listed the index below, since it's one thing I like to read before purchasing a book. Hope this helps you make your decision. <P>The Index:<P>1. Making Smart Decisions About File Systems<P>2. Planning Backups and Restores<P>3. Booting and Hardward Diagnotics<P>4. Configuring Run States<P>5. Installing and Patching your Solaris System<P>6. Exloring Jumpstart<P>7. Setting up Name Services<P>8. Network Information Services NIS+ and NIS<P>9. Monitoring your Environment<P>10. Understanding File Systems--So that's what those are!<P>11. Automate everything..Well almost!<P>12. Keeping your Solaris Systems Secure<P>13. Implementing High Availability: Eliminating Single Points of Failure<P>14. Maintaining your Sun Hardware<P>15. Peripheral Vision: Understanding and Configuring Other Hardware<P>16. The E10000 (Starfire)--Not Just a Big Unix Box<P>17. Running an Internet Site<P>18. Coexisiting with the Evil Empire (Windows)</span>

                    <span>I've been a Solaris systems administrator for more than 5 years and thought I knew a lot, but reading the second edition of this book has given me more insights than any other book on the subject. It is well written and very practical. I feel as if the authors have given me the benefit of their combined years of working with Solaris. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>This second edition of "Solaris Solutions" is a MAJOR improvement over the now-outdated first edition. The book now incudes a chapter on the Sun Fire server line along with Solaris and Veritas Volume Managers, Web Start Flash, LDAP in Solaris, RBAC (role-based access control), IPsec and other Solaris 9 topics. Written by two career Solaris sysadmins, this book is extremely practical, clearly written and ultimately helpful.</span>
