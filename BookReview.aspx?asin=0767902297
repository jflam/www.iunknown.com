                    <span>I enjoyed this book because Pat is definetely old school when she comes to her coaching and managing.  I think as America has become a rich country, hard driving individuals like Pat and her parents have become downgraded as more people opt for the human relations style management.  Pat proves that the hard driven type management is still very effective in motivating people to their best.  In this book, Pat describes both her personal and professional experiences and how that has changed her to the coach she is today.  Nothing beats success, and Pat's championships prove her way can make results.<br>This book is a surprisely good read on leadership and managing.  It is applicable to both sports and business.  The personal and professional stories prove that Pat's way is still effective in today's world.</span>

                    <span>Of course, I could not just read one of Pat Summitt's books, I had to read all three. Pat has a plain, matter-of-fact and in-your-face style that is refreshing. If you can not find the mountain of success to climb, Pat will bring the mountain to you. She forces you to look at her definite dozen and find the areas where you know you could most likely improve. And without fail, she will lay down the gauntlet challenging you. She makes you believe that success is within everyone's reach, if you would just work at it. I have made some adjustments myself, since I have started a part-time home based business. I have read a number of books on success. "Reach for the Summit" is by far the clearest, simplest and most inspiring that I have read.  GREAT WORK PAT!</span>

                    <span>Being a girl's basketball coach, I first thought I would gain some insight into how to build a winning program.  While Pat Summit's book gives you the elements of that, she does a far better job of explaining how to "bake the cake" than simply what to put in it.  This book is excellent for people in management positions (that's right, coaching is management)and appropriate points are made relevant to sports, business and life in general.   Simply put, clear instructions, clear focus on the ultimate goal, and hard work are an unbeatable combination, that usually result in not having to make excuses or explanations.  <br> I treasure this book as something to utilize along with Coach Wooden's "Pyramid of Success".  If you're looking for a new style offense or a secret to better defense, forget it.  If you're interested in developing the most out of your players as athletes, and more importantly, people; this book is a must.</span>

                    <span>As I read through her book, I find myself alternately admiring and feeling a bit sorry for Pat Summit.  I admire her because there is no "secret" per se to her success. As the reader learns, you acheive success by working harder, preparing better, and wanting it more than  anyone else. This book is not for the person who believes in the "get  rich quick" idea of success. Although she has adapted her techniques  over the years, at her core she is her father's daughter, and that is where  my feeling sorry for her comes in.  Every one needs encouragement and  praise, just as they need a kick in the backside every once in awhile.  As  we find out in her book, more often than not, Summit is on the receiving  end of one of those kicks.  That type of childhood, where praise is seldom  handed out can do one of two things: it can make you strong,ambitious, and  eager to acheive or, it can break your spirit.  In the case of Pat Summit,  it is the former.  She is definitely driven to succeed. One might question  at what kind of cost. I read this book right on the heels of reading Phil  Jackson's book, Sacred Hoops, and it is very interesting to contrast the  two styles. For Phil, it's the journey; for Pat, it's the destination.  Be  that as it may, I still admire Pat Summit, the woman, the coach, and her  book for its "tell it like it  is" sytle.  She is definitely  "old school", and there is a lot to be said for that kind of  mentality.  A lot has been accomplished in the world because of that type  of thinking. You just have to be careful that it is not at too great a  cost.  In Pat's case, she seems to be able to balance coach, wife, and  mother well, partly because she is married to a man who isn't threatened by  her success. All in all, the book is an interesting snap shot of the woman  and what makes her tick.  There aren't any real surprises.  With Pat  Summit, what you see is what you get.</span>

                    <span>Having long been a fan of Pat Summitt & the Tennessee Lady Vols, I finally got around to reading this book and I must say it was a real eye-opener.  You've seen pictures of Pat on tv & in the newspapers,  usually in some player's face during a crucial moment of a game & you  might think, "this woman is really tough on her players."  Well,  guess what? She IS tough, and many of the players that she's been toughest  on went on to be championship players in the WNBA after getting their  degrees at the University Of Tennessee.  Other than building championship  teams, Pat's main goal is seeing that her players get their education &  graduate.  Everyone on the team must sit in the 1st 3 rows in their classes  and pay attention.  After reading this book, I came away with the  realization that she really does care about these young women and always  made it a point to assure them of this.  At times when she knew she'd  really have to lean on a player, Pat would contact their parents to give  them a heads up so that there would be no misunderstanding.  Pat Summitt  grew up tough but fair, not afraid of hard work and expecting alot from  others.  Her Definite Dozen System is easy to apply in any job, in all  walks of life.  You just have to be determined to overcome adversity and to  face every challenge that comes your way.  Highly recommended reading for  everyone, not just fans of women's basketball.</span>
