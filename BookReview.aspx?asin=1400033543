                    <span>This is no question in this reader's mind that Dave Eggers is a talented and engaging writer. There are sections of this book, as there were in AHWOSG, that are amazingly conceived and executed, as perfectly written as anything I've read. When I get to one of those sections -- be it a paragraph or 20 pages -- I feel like I'm in the story, it's so personal and sincere. However, and with Eggers there always seems to be a however, there aren't enough of those sections to overcome an only better than average plot and really [bad] editing to lift this book into 4 or 5 star territory. <P>Still, I happy to admit I did enjoy this book. The characters are consistent and truly imagined. The self-doubt and confusion of Will is easy to understand, though his inner conversations tended to get on my nerves a little bit and parts of this internal dialogue tended toward preachy. The fact that it literally took mne around the world is worth something too.<P>Go ahead and read this book. It's worth it. Just be prepared to find a lot of typos, bad pagination, etc. I suppose those are the perils of self-publishing, but they do detract from an otherwise well-done novel.</span>

                    <span>You Shall Know Our Velocity is an excellent novel dealing with the grief Will, the novel's narrator, and his best friend Hand experience after the sudden, tragic death of Jack, the third in their former threesome. The three had been friends since childhood and had always expected to be together, until Jack is suddenly killed in an accident hwen they are in their mid-twenties. To deal with their grief, or maybe to run away from it, Hand and Will haphazardly plan a trip around the world in one week to give away $80,000 Will has acquired almost by accident. The novel concerns both this trip and Will's story of his friendship with Jack. Their travels never go as intended (because they never, ever make any plans). Will's reflections on Jack's death are devastatingly evocative. Eggers is an excellent writer and the novel is, for the most part, a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. It will make you laugh and break your heart in the same paragraph many times. Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>Occassionally, I will fall for a catchy title. And fall, I did.There is not much depth here; attempts to amuse and entertain fall as flat as the prose. Not worth the trouble. Oh, well. Better luck next time.</span>

                    <span>I've watched Dave Eggers rise to fame from our shared corner of the world, and I thought his first novel was brilliant, but something has happened to Eggers' writing in this novel. What was once quirky and refreshing about his writing seems more like artifice in this book. More often than not, Eggers' writing and plot twists are less profound than they are show-offy. While I was reading the book, I felt like Eggers was a two-year-old prancing around in front of the reading public saying, "Look at me! Aren't I cute? Look at the adorable tricks I can do!"<P>Admittedly, some of Eggers' literary tricks in this book are cute, and there are moments of touching and hilarious prose. (My favorite line: "I opened my mouth but couldn't think of any way to answer. Someone was using my head to power a coffeemaker.") <P>But in the end, the plot feels too forced, the writing too self-conscious. Dave Eggers is a good writer. This book doesn't, sadly, fully reflect that. _</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This generation of young readers-- who would be drawn to a title like this-- deserves better than what Eggers offers. This writer is simply a no-talent who attracts shallow, self-indulgent readers who get off on nonsense verbage that's not even creative or interesting, but dull and flat-- simply because it is "different". I am all for innovative irreverence when done with supple imagination as what I and others have found in another book that is slowly surfacing. SIMON LAZARUS by M.A. Kirkwood is so worth the time and attention of a hungry generation of young readers. Don't miss out on it. If you like substantive reads like LIFE OF PI or MIDDLESEX then SIMON LAZARUS is your ticket to a well-deserved reading experience.</span>
