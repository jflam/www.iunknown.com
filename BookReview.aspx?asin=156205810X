                <span id="Label1">Creating Web sites is easy. Creating sites that truly meet the needs and expectations of the wide range of online users is quite another story. In <I>Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity,</I> renowned Web usability guru Jakob Nielsen shares his insightful thoughts on the subject. Packed with annotated examples of actual Web sites, this book sets out many of the design precepts all Web developers should follow.<p> This guide segments discussions of Web usability into page, content, site, and intranet design. This breakdown skillfully isolates for the reader many subtly different challenges that are often mixed together in other discussions. For example, Nielsen addresses the requirements of viewing pages on varying monitor sizes separately from writing concise text for "scanability." Along the way, the author pulls no punches with his opinions, using phrases like "frames: just say no" to immediately make his feelings known. Fortunately, his advise is some of the best you'll find.<p> One of the unique aspects of this title is the use of actual statistics to buttress the author's opinions on various techniques and technologies. He includes survey results on sizes of screens, types of queries submitted to search portals, response times by connection type and more. This book is intended as the first of two volumes--focusing on the "what." The author promises a follow-up title that will show the "hows" and, based on this installation, we can't wait. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Cross-platform design, response time considerations, writing for the Web, multimedia implementation, navigation strategies, search boxes, corporate intranet design, accessibility for disabled users, international considerations, and future predictions. </span>

                    <span>This was one of the first usability books I bought.  It was great, and I couldn't believe someone wrote all of these ideas down.  It _is_ a good book.  It is well written, and he does a good job of illustrating his examples.
<br />
<br />However, for as much usability testing that Jakob must do, he provides little data to back it up.  Perhaps hard data was not a requirement for web usability books written in 1999/2000, but it will have a more difficult time standing up to books written more recently.</span>

                    <span>For a book written in 1999, it's already an achievement that's it's not completely useless, but still it's a bit outdated. Most of its prophecies are wrong (email tokens, anyone? Browsers will be out of date?), and its advice is only good if, first, you believe in it, and second, if you have to manage a site the size of Microsoft.
<br />Even so, part of the book is rather useless. Intranet design does not say anytthing new, desining for disabilities misses many standards, and the part on writing for a global audience seems to be written for the kind of user usable web sites are addressed to, that is, not very bright, I guess. That makes half the book probably very usable, but not very useful.
<br />At the end of the day, if you look for advice for improving the design of your SOHO site, or your blog, you'll find next to nothing in this book.</span>
