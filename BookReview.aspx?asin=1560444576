                <span id="Label1">Written by veteran trail-guide author Erik Molvar, Hiking  Olympic National Park, formerly The Trail Guide to Olympic National  Park, describes a 585-mile network of maintained trails in a wilderness  ecosystem that stretches from the beaches of the Pacific to the heart  of the Olympic Mountains.  The trails provide a full spectrum of  challenges, from strenuous backpacking trips over glacier-clad  mountains to short strolls through a temperate rainforest. Hiking  Olympic National Park includes mile-by-mile descriptions, maps, and  elevation charts for each trail.  This comprehensive guidebook is  organized to help you plan your trips and includes an index to all the  topographic maps you will need as well as tips on no-trace camping and  wilderness safety techniques. Hiking Olympic National Park is an  indispensable part of your next trip into the wilds of the Olympic  Peninsula.</span>

                    <span>I am a voulunteer Back-country Ranger for Olympic National Park, and this book is in my pack every time I head out into the back-country. His details are just what I want. I do not care for books that are so indepth that you know the hike before you start. What adventure is in that. He describes the location of back-country camp sites better than other authors. His book is very user friendly. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I ordered the three Olympic Mountains trail guides that seemed most highly recommended -- Molvar, Blair, and Wood -- and was impressed by each. I needed a guide for a 7 to 10 day visit to Olympic, of which I had no prior knowledge. Wood's book is definitely the most comprehensive and technical of the three. If I lived near Olympic or had more time, it would definitely be my first choice. Blair's book of day hikes is also an excellent book, with useful topo maps and a 1 - 5 star rating system that makes choosing the day's hike that much easier, especially for out-of-towners. It is chattier than Wood, in a sort of happy-day-hike way (pointing out picnic spots and giving more local history, for example), and includes hikes from a few to 10+ hours. The happy medium between these two books is Molvar. It is written in a friendly narrative, but with enough information to put together a several-days hike. Its weak point is its lack of topo maps, but the trail maps are still very useable, and the elevation profiles are helpful. It also includes beach trails not found in Blair.</span>

                    <span>This book is copyright 1995, and its entries seem to be every bit this out-of-date. Of those I know, one trail re-opened years ago is listed as closed; one trail marked is no longer; one trail missing has been around for years. I can only assume trails closed for years are listed as open. The maps are likewise poor, missing many details such as maybe half the privy locations I know of and at least one trail where there is none. The trail descriptions look encouraging at first but as I read them more closely provide little information useful for predicting how a group might fare on the journey.<P>At a minimum, an updated version of this book is overdue.<P>Maybe I expect too much of a trail guide, but it almost makes me wish Ira Spring had a book covering the Olympic coast. On the bright side, the best thing about this dearth of coverage is that it helps keep the coast in relative wilderness.</span>

                    <span>guide book of the Olympic Pennisula. It is the book I carry most often in my pack (though I have a bad habit of cutting out the pages I need - my book is about dead) I have had this book for over 2 years and is well used. I like Erik's style of writing, and that he gives distances at major points along the way. Wood's book is good also, but a little old school for my taste. Thanks to Erik, I found myself in Badger Valley, Grand Valley, Royal Basin and Flapjack Lakes this summer, some of the prettiest hikes I have ever done. If you like this, check out his North Cascade book also.</span>

                    <span>The problem with this guide is that although it has nothing specifically wrong with it, the book has nothing specifically to recommend it.<BR>The maps are better than some, but aren't topographic maps you can actually navigate by. The trail descriptions are dry and boring and tend to overemphasize the vegetation one is likely to find or the geological features that really have little to do with how your feet are reacting to the trail.<BR>If you're looking for a great backpacking guide to the Olympic Mountains, I'd suggest Robert L. Wood's Olympic Mountains Trail Guide. If you're planning on day hikes, I don't think you can beat the new Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula, by Seabury Jr. Blair</span>
