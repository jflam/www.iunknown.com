                    <span>John C. Bogle,  the legendary founder and Chairman of the Vanguard Group, is one of the giants in the mutual fund industry and a great marketer of his ideas. His approach to investing appears to be endorsed by such luminaries as Warren Buffet, Paul Samuelson, former Treasury and Wall street legend Secretary William E. Simon, Michael Bloomberg and many more (see "Praise for Common Sense on Mutual Funds" at the front of this book.)
<br />Mr. Bogle's basic theses are that one ought to take the long view (20 or 30 years) of investing, stay the course and stick with the averages.  His approach is embodied by index funds that were pioneered by (guess who?)  John C. Bogle.  Mr. Bogle goes to great lengths to prove with mountains of statistics that in the long run fund managers rarely beat the averages.  In addition, since the average investor probably won't be able to beat the averages, why pay more than you have to for commissions and management fees when Vanguard can offer a bare bones approach.  Never mind that mutual fund management fees are trivial compared to the double digit returns that are possible and that most people know better than to pay sales charges and buy only no-load funds.  
<br />This book provides a benchmark against which to measure all other investment strategies.  If you are not absolutely convinced that you or your fund manager(s) can outperform the averages in the long run, Mr. Bogle's approach is very reasonable.
<br />However, let me suggest the flaws in Mr. Bogle's logic.  As an experienced investor who was able to achieve substantial double digit returns during the 1990s and who only lost money (a mere 4%) in one year after the millennium, I have relied on value investing in growth stocks, on my knowledge of certain growth industries  and, most recently, on counter-cyclical mutual funds.
<br />The first flaw is that any buy-and-hold strategy is suspect in this information age.  Mr. Bogle's advice would encourage the investor to ride the stock market crash of 1929 all the way to its bottom in 1933 and again from 2000 through 2002.  Such a strategy would be (and was) devastating to many investors.  It would take years of average performance to climb back out of such a hole. Witness the fallen angels of the 1980s and 1990s such as Dell and EMC, which lost over 50% of their value between 2000 and 2002 and have not yet recouped those losses.  Additional logic flaws include: 
<br />1.	No fund manager worth his or her salt would stick with the same portfolio year in and year out but would review and adjust it at least annually if not quarterly.  And no investor should stick with the same fund manager(s) year in and year out without reviewing past performance and evaluating the appropriateness of the current investment strategy to market conditions. Finally, both will diversify to spread the risk.
<br />2.	Just as no fund manager will consistently beat the averages over 20 or 30 years, exactly half of all fund managers will beat the median performance each year (see definition of "median").  So superior performance is statistically possible if you choose the right horse more often than not.
<br />3.	It is financial suicide for an investor to ignore clear warning signs on the horizon.  For a example, the southeast Asian economic and Long Term Capital crises in 1998 were an early warning of market meltdown that began two years later.  Moreover, any value investor would have noticed that internet stocks were selling for price-to-sales multiples that exceeded rational price-earnings (PE) ratios.  In other words, even with 100% profit margins, i.e. no operating or overhead costs, these companies' multiples were unjustifiably high.  
<br />4.	Few of today's investor will be able to put their investment portfolois in cryogenic storage for 20 or 30 years.  Most will add or subtract funds over the years as personal circumstances, e.g. school tuitions,  medical emergencies, real estate investments, dictate.  And many of us don't achieve significant available funds to invest until the last decade or so from retirement.  Markets can stall for a decade or more (witness the 1970s) while individual companies and market sectors rise or fall significantly. And there is some evidence that we may be experiencing a similarly flat market in this post-bubble market.
<br />While available space does not permit a more complete discussion of this topic, my conclusion is that while John Bogle's book is a good place for the novice investor to start, it falls far short of a complete investment strategy.  Novice or dissatisfied investors would do well to look further for a more adaptive strategy.

                    <span>Mr. Bogle would like you to believe that history will repeat itself.  He believes that the market performance is indeed repeatable.  He also believes that the unmanaged index fund will continue to outperform the majority of its managed peers by a sound margin, which will compound over time.  The outcome of next year's stock market performance, much like which baseball team will win the World Series, is certainly unpredictable, yet we still try to predict the outcome, even though we can not ask what will happen in many repetitions over the years.  Next year's market performance, like the World Series winner, will happen only once under a unique set of conditions, most of which we may never see again, and even if we do, will not be present at the same time.
<br />
<br />As an answer to the question of market performance next year, or for that matter, any other year, if probability measures what would happen if we did something many, many times, Mr. Bogle's position is neither a probability nor a certainty, though it is wrapped up in many impressive statistics.  Probability is based on data about many repetitions of the same random phenomenon.  Mr. Bogle is giving us something else when he makes the case for the index fund- his personal judgment.  This is why I say that Mr. Bogle's book is a clever, yet deceptively effective advertisement.
<br />
<br />While it is true that you are following and measuring the same number, total return, over time, the conditions used to generate this number are not the same, thus you can not use the rules of chance to determine what the total return will be going forward.  You can not even use the rules of chance, which tell us what the likely outcomes would be under the same conditions done repeatedly, to tell you even what the average total return would be, nor could you use it to give you a reliable range of returns.  However, you can use the tools and techniques of descriptive statistics to tell you the distribution of total returns in the past,  but you could not use them to make inferences (that is, to draw conclusions) about the future.  To do this, you would have to assume that future will be like the past, and you have to assume that prevailing conditions today will also be the same tomorrow.  Both assumptions are ridiculous.  There were some conditions prevalent in the past that we will most likely never, ever see again, and do much to explain the impressive performance, expressed as annualized total return, of the stock and bond markets.  Mr. Bogle's analysis considers only market performance.  It does not consider the demographic, socio-economic and political trends underlying this market performance.
<br />
<br />As an anwer to the question of relative performance between the index fund approach and the managed fund approach, first let me say that Mr. Bogle is not the first to point out that an unmanaged index outperforms its managed peers.  Indeed, the first to point this out was a Mr. Cowles, who created the Cowles Commission sometime around the Great Depression.  The Cowles Commission was devoted to looking at the nature of stock market returns among managed (then held by various banks, insurance companies and brokerages) funds versus the broader market.  The work of the Cowles Commission was later absorbed by Standard and Poor's, and more than a few big name academics at the University of Chicago (Fama and Markowitz just to name a couple) got their start doing work with the Cowles Commission.  It comes as no surprise to me, or for that matter, to market insiders, that most managed index funds fail to beat a benchmark index (though over the years, the proportion that has failed to do so has steadily fallen).
<br />
<br />Second, the indexing approach does have merits, but in my mind, it works best for bonds, simply because one requires a lot of cash (usually 100K) to get a piece of any one particular issue, otherwise trading costs are prohibitive, and good diversification at those amounts would run into the millions.  Moreover, returns on bonds do have an upper bound, and when the bonds come due, the principal is all you get.  This is especially true for corporate bonds, but less so for Treasuries.  Fees (expenses and loads), combined with taxes and inflation do the most damage to bond funds, because the return is limited, so using a bond index to limit one's costs seems like an intelligent move to me, so long as one pays close attention to the credit rating of the issue and in the case of the bond index fund, the average number of years to maturity.
<br />
<br />Third, the stock index approach works best for those who have better things to do than pick stocks, and look upon the activity as being about as fun as having a root canal without an anesthetic.  While any individual electing to take the index approach will not ever get the highest possible return, those returns, in most periods will likely be better than those obtained by any managed fund.
<br />
<br />You need a relatively strong background in mathematics, especially in the areas of statistics and elementary calculus, to understand this book.  Mr. Bogle argues for low cost (and preferably indexed) funds in any style category or asset class and elaborates on their inherent superiority; after all, he operates a low cost fund, so he should know, right?  Basically, what you the investor need to know boils down to this:  if you intend to 'play' the market, you might as well be the market, or at least the closest facsimile of it you can be.  However, as Mr. Buffett has pointed out, by becoming the market, you get the good, as well as the bad, and if you can stand mediocrity, more power to you.  Given that mediocrity tends to outperform sophisticated stockpicking over time, it may not be that bad, after all.

<br />This book should be retitled as "The Case for the Index Fund".   </span>

                    <span>He just sells one point in the book:
<br />
<br />"Buy low cost Index funds."
<br />
<br />And he supports it with examples and historical analysis. But completely disregards the fact that actively managed funds can beat the index in bull market and good managers have a track record on not nose diving in bear market.  So low cost and diversification should be a high priority, good management and strategy are also equally important. You don't have to always follow the index, people do outperform it in long term with low cost. The catch is P/E ratio.</span>

                    <span>I was disappointed that John Bogel having connected historical earnings to market performance over the long term missed the historical relationship of P/E to inflation.  He called P/E expansion "speculation" and P/E contraction the reversal of the same.  Not true.
<br />Market P/E's are connected directly by market forces to real returns in investment alternatives. Equities have averaged earnings growth close to 6.2%. (This is another miscalculation-better to look at the earnings channel and calculate the slope of this channel because earnings do have a wobble year-to-year.  This is in contrast to Bogel's surprisingly simplistic approach of selecting a simple beginning point to end point analysis.) The P/E's of the 1955-1965 period were very close to 20 because rates were low and inflation was near 1-2% range. This changed as inflation began to creep into the market in 1965, read this as excessive government spending w/Great Society and Vietnam, and was sustained thru 1982 when Volcker took the steps to reverse it. The IBES Model that maps the 10yr Treasury yield vs the SP500 earnings yield explains the last 25yrs quite well. The SP500's P/E of less than 7 in 1982 is related to a market earnings yield of 15%-16% while the 10Yr Treas was at 15%.  These yields fell closely together for the next 20yrs thus showing that the market P/E adjusted to a competitive environment.  Only from 1995-2000 did the speculative excess eventually have the market 60% OVERVALUED.
<br />Bogel is biased to selling his Vanguard Funds and his analysis stops well short of acceptable analysis.
<br />Further, although the average manager does not do much for investors, there certainly are superior managers whose records are sustained over time. These managers represent the top 10% and they are not that hard to find once you start to look. Just recognize that markets have cycles that factor into near term manager investment returns. Don't buy at the top! Even the best manager will give you short-term disappointment if you buy at the top.</span>

                    <span>In waging his crusade against actively managed funds, Bogle loses sight of the fact that even index funds are managed nonetheless. Take the popular Vanguard 500 Index Fund, which is indexed to S&P 500.  He still cannot dodge the question: Who decides which stock gets listed or delisted?  It's S&P itself, which manages the index.  But why does he suppose that S&P is always a better managing institution than the best mutual fund companies that actively manage their funds? <br>   <br>    Arguably, most fund managers can't outperform the indexes, but that does NOT mean that no managers actively managing their funds ever outperform the indexes. If you have to put money in the market, why not go for the best? And sure, managers can blow up too, but you can still diversify amongst the best managed funds. <p>    As to costs, sure, index funds have small expenses compared to actively managed funds, but index funds have a serious drawback--usually a lot more volatility that makes owning them riskier.  Investing is not just about keeping expenses to a minimum--important as it is.  Neither is it merely about performance. It's also about controlling risks and preserving capital.  I for one wouldn't want to own a fund--even for the long term and however cheap--if it's up 40% one year, down 30% the next, and then up %25% still the next and so on.  I'm willing to pay more knowing that my capital would be preserved even in a down market.  No index funds can be compared to the safety and nonvolatile nature of such funds as SGENX, OAKBX, MERFX and MVALX, which have very low betas.  <p>    Bogle's indexing approach is for me a sure path to mediocrity. If you have to put money in the market, why not go for the best funds with a long-term market-beating track record and consistent returns?  To reduce management-related risks, why not also diversify amongst the best managed funds?  <p>    That said, I don't mean to say that you should not own index funds at all.</span>
