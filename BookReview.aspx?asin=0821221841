                    <span>         This is a book well suited for people who are looking to become very serious in the photography field. There's chapters on subjects from visualization to camera adjustments. It discusses the good and the bad that come along with many different types of cameras like small, medium, and large format cameras. It shares advice and techniques on how to create the best images with the camera you are using. 
<br />          The information is very accurate and detailed. Every subject is discussed with great depth. I think that the diagrams and pictures that are provided also aid in a full and complete understanding of the different subjects discussed. Also, the book should probably be read along with the 2 other books that follow it in the series, allowing you to get the  complete view into photography. Although I personally have never really been very into photography this book actually inspired me to maybe someday really getting into it. </span>

                    <span>Just like his photos, this book is a classic. It explains the fundamentals quite clearly, with intuitive diagram and real pictures. Its coverage on view camera is extremely valuable. Although not many people use view camera these days, that chapter is an eye-openner for appreciating some of the best pictures ever taken by Ansel and other classic photographers. Its coverage on the basic principles are very thourough too. A must read for every serious photographer.</span>

                    <span>Ansel Adams is indeed one of the most highly regarded photographers ever, and in this first of three instructional books, he reveals much of the foundational wisdom that he gathered over a lifetime taking pictures. The focus of this book is the camera and deals with all types and formats of film cameras and techniques for using them to take wonderful photos. <p>This book is one of the most common and cherished textbooks used in beginning photography but is indispensable for any interested in better understanding camera arts.</span>

                    <span>This whole series (The Camera, The Negative, & The Print) are highly recommended for anyone seriously interested in learning more about photography and improving their skills. If you're not interested in that, then the books are probably still worth adding to your collection just to see all of Adams's stunning images.</span>
