                <span id="Label1">Author David Pugliese tells you everything the government doesn't want you to know about the most secret unit in the Canadian military today: Joint Task Force Two. Canada's Secret Commandos goes behind the scenes in uncovering the missions, training and inner workings of Canada's version of Delta Force and the SAS. The book reveals the unit's most secretive plans, including details about their current mission to Afghanistan in the war against terrorism, a bid to rescue Canadian peacekeepers held hostage in Bosnia, an even more dangerous scheme to launch an attack on terrorists in Peru, and commando missions in Nepal and the Central African Republic.</span>

                    <span>Pugliese pulls together a pretty good read on a unit that is so new, there is almost nothing known about it. Canada's top special operations unit appears to be more active than the country knows, and the author appears to have some unique insight to their missions. If you are interested in Special Forces, Delta, SEALs, SAS, GSG-9, GIGN and the like, this book will offer you an interesting perspective on Canada's counter-terrorism unit.</span>

                    <span>The amount of information the author gathered about jtf2 is very impressive, especially considering 99 percent of the canadian public has never hered of that unit. I learned a fare amount about jtf2 when I served in the Royal Canadian Regiment, but not nearly to the extent of this book, at the same time I'm sure there's a few things that this book did not uncover. I would recommend this book to all canadian citizins and anyone with an interest in special forces units.</span>

                    <span>Trying to find information on an Elite group such as this is exhausting to say the least. With this group of individuals being a relatively classified, closely guarded bunch by their government, you will find yourself reading and researching many other forms of literature that may touch upon the JTF2 and their predecessors. This is where the real struggle of fact finding begins. Many things are conflicting like the age of this elite group, training facilities and the pre-existence of the group. The author does a wonderful job giving the reader leads for researching. <P>Good Luck <BR>** This IS an exceptional group as pointed out by another reader, Dave from Falls Church.</span>

                    <span>but the author certainly treads where no other author has gone before and certainly gets the "essence" of the unit down. I thought he did a great job as well of illustrating how a country as free and democratic as Canada leans towards elements of ultrasecrecy for several of its governmental organizations including JTF2 where other governments openly discuss and brag about their Special Forces. Perhaps this book is best used to exemplify what is a failing of our military system in not using a force like JTF2 and other Canadian military units to increase recruitment.</span>

                    <span>Ottawa Citizen writer David Pugliese presents us with as much information that he could glean in his years writing and researching about "Canada's SAS". I would not agree with that comparison as JTF2 are far too young a unit to have the experience and expertise that the SAS or any of the world's other elite units have. However, given Canada's recent involvement in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan I believe firmly that Pugliese will HAVE to update his book as the stories coming from Southwest Asia about this unit are extremely impressive.<P>So, in a nutshell, the book reads extremely quickly. Pugliese makes a point of comparing the worlds other elite units and it will only be a matter of time before JTF2 is spoken in the same breath as these units.</span>
