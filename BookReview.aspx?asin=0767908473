                <span id="Label1">Harry Potter aficionados: remember when Buckbeak, Hagrid's pet  Hippogriff, was put on trial by the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous  Creatures? This crazy idea was not invented by Harry Potter's creator, J.K.  Rowling. In fact, from medieval times all the way up to the 19th century,  animals and even insects were often charged with crimes, arrested, imprisoned,  tried, convicted, and sometimes executed. Harry Potter's fantastic world of  magic has its roots in true history, mythology, and folklore; father-daughter  team Allan Zola Kronzek and Elizabeth Kronzek have now made this wealth of  astonishing information available to Muggles in their <I>Sorcerer's  Companion</I>. From astrology to Grindylow to reading tea leaves to witch  persecution, this fascinating volume gets to the bottom of every magical mystery  connected with Hogwarts. Readers learn the unusual method by which premodern  Europeans protected themselves from the cry of the uprooted Mandrake, involving  a loyal dog and a rope. (Professor Sprout's solution was to have her herbology  students wear earmuffs). Hermione probably knew, when she was hexed by Draco  Malfoy so that her teeth suddenly grew past her chin, that hexes originated in  Europe. But did she know the connection between hexes and the folk magic of the  Pennsylvania Dutch? For fans of the tremendously popular Harry Potter series, or  anyone who is intrigued by magical lore, the <I>Sorcerer's Companion</I> will  quickly become a true friend. (Ages 9 and older) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I></span>

                    <span>If you're expecting a "Harry Potter" book don't buy this one. If you are interested in learning about the myths that inspired Rowling, then you'll like it. In fact this book could have been written pre-1995, the only difference would be that there would be no refereces to JKR's work. (Rowling would have found it usefull in writing her stories.)
<br />
<br />I have been studying the occult for 8 years, so not much of the information in this book was new to me. I bought it because I have been reading the Harry Potter books for 4 years, and have recognised many things in the books that closely resemble occult truths. I wanted to see someone else's take on the subject, (given the way Rowling is criticised for the occult-ness of her books). 
<br />
<br />This book would be best for those who are beginners in the area of mythology/occult teachings. Those well versed in this area will probally not find a great deal of new information in this book, but would probally still find it an amusing read. Also for those who are totally Harry obsessed (as I am).
<br />
<br />If they come out with a new edition for the remaining books I will definitely buy it.</span>

                    <span>This is a really good and accurate study of the things in harry potter.
<br />
<br />it gives you the histroy and the background aronud some of the more mysterious subjects you come across in the harry potter series and of corse so of the more common subjects. 
<br />
<br />it even teaches you a little bit about each subject. it gives you a good explanation of arithmancy and enough info to do some basics on it.
<br />
<br />Same with tea leaf reading.
<br />
<br />good read and worth it.</span>

                    <span>I found this book VERY entertaining, and funny. It doesn't offer anything in the way of clues to the mysteries of Harry Potter, but it will broaden your understanding of mythology throughout history, and give you a better understanding of many things mentioned in the the HP books. Including a bit on Arithmancy (which you can actually do yourself), and Transfiguration, and the meaning of those Rune stones Hermione's always talking about. It also takes a look at the origins of spell casting and mythical beasts like the basilisk, hinkypunk and kappa.
<br />
<br />Understanding better why JKR choose some of the creatures and myths that she did for her books helps in your enjoyment of them, and this book will certainly do that. It's also helpful when trying to form some of your own theories on the HP books.
<br />Expanding on the legend of the Grim, this book notes that they are creatures found only at graveyards or in burial grounds, and that if Harry knew this he might not have thought the dog he was seeing in POA was a grim, we then hear from JKR that indeed there is a graveyard at Hogwarts that will turn up in book 6. I found this to be very interesting and wonder if JKR will use that part of the grim myth in her next book. It was also funny to read the part about vampires being irresistibly drawn to counting anything. And can be distracted by throwing a bunch of pebbles in front of them, so you can get away.
<br />There are many more bits like this to be found throughout the book, and whether you use it for sleuthing purposes or not, it's a great read!</span>

                    <span>A great night table book, it is arranged in short, alphabetical entries that can be read quickly.  The authors seem uniquely suited to their subject-matter and obviously know their stuff.  But, while they try to cite passages from the books as much as possible, most of the material just doesn't apply.  JK Rowling seems to have skimmed a volume like this, then put it into a blender and extracted her own take on it all.  It's liable to make purists a tad angry.  It's all very interesting in its own right, though.  I would have liked a lot more info on the "real" stuff, and less of a stretch to make it applicable.</span>

                    <span>This is a very interesting book and I read it over and over. The only thing wrong with it is that I was expecting for it to have something to do with HP, but it didn't, aside from mentioning it every once in a while. It's like an encyclopedia of monsters and magic and it's interesting, but it's muggle lore, it's what people actually believed in the middle ages and other times. While JKR certainly based some of her magical creatures on traditional folk lore, it is her book and she changed the creatures to suit the plot. By itself it's wonderful, but don't expect much insight on the books.</span>
