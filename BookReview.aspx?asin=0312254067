They are extraordinarily helpful in all aspects of our daily routines, from banking to transportation, shopping to surgery.  On the other hand, a "bug" in a computer program can now lead to dire consequences, making the rule of the computer programmer more valuable than ever before.<br>In one fo the most unique yet necessary books ever to appear, Daniel Kohanski, a seasoned programmer and systems consultant, provides a breezy and insightful overview of the fascinating craft of computer programming.  With topics ranging from history to aesthetics, from subroutines to ethics, <i>Moths in the Machine</i> will leave even the most inexperienced reader with a deep understanding of the critical role programmers play in the modern world.<br></div></span>

                    <span>As a programmer, I found this book's discussions on the aesthetics of programming to be unique and very helpful.  The code samples given were not as interesting, but they were not aimed at experienced programmers.  It is a perfect introduction for people who have experience in analyzing data (engineers, actuaries, etc.) but have never programmed.  Don't read this book to learn new code tricks, or any specific language; but I've never read anything better about the art of programming, for either the professional or the beginner.</span>

                    <span>A great explanation of how the current state of programming came to be. However, the depth of this book is very simplistic, and won't hold the interest of anyone whose done more than a level 100 programming course.</span>

                    <span>I liked some of the history in the book, but overall, I think it's ONLY a good read for those not already familiar with the "art" of computer programming. I think if you're already a programmer and have been coding for years, you can pretty much skip this book. I learned some history reading the book, but I didn't think it was a worthwhile use of time (for me). The book mainly talks about aesthetics, the fact that a computer is ONLY a machine, and has no "brain",.. etc. I think pretty much any intelligent being (in the computer field) already knows this.<p>The parts of the book that covered code might be of some use to someone who wants to experiment with "becoming a programmer," and I guess if you like this book, you will like being a programmer, or perhaps not.<p>Overall, good book for a non-techie who thinks he/she might be interested in the field.... and probably not the best use of time for someone who's already proficient in the "art".</span>

                    <span>Thanks, Daniel, for adding your voice to the discussion about what we do with computers. I have the original hardcover version of this book, and am highly recommending it to my students and programming apprentices. Kohanski eloquently puts forth the argument for aesthetics in programming, a concept that is being lost as Microsoft et al. focus more and more on "user-friendly" methods of producing code at all levels (object-oriented, scripting, mark-up etc.) which rely on WYSIWYG interfaces. The nightmare code that emerges out the other end of these hands-off interfaces is making a huge impact on the reusability and therefore productivity of all those end-user produced applications. This is going to come back to bite us in the end, just like all other programming "shortcuts"! Maybe we can get more people to read books like this and understand what they are actually doing with their machines!</span>
