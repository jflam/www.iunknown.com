                <span id="Label1">According to Robert Baer, the center of the global economy is a "kingdom built on thievery, one that nurtures terrorism, destroys any possibility of a middle class based on property rights, and promotes slavery and prostitution." This kingdom also sits on one quarter of the world's oil reserves, thus ensuring that it receives the full support and protection of the U.S. government. <I>Sleeping With the Devil</I> details the hypocritical and corrupt relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and the potentially calamitous economic consequences of maintaining this Faustian bargain.  </p> As Baer makes clear, the U.S. has been aware of problems within the bitterly divided Al Sa'ud family for years, but has ignored the facts in order to keep lucrative business deals afloat. (The amount of money the royal family spends to influence powerful American politicians and lobbyists is staggering.) Particularly damning are his details regarding Saudi Arabia's support of militant Islamic groups, including al Qaeda. The ruling family funnels millions of dollars to such groups in order to dissuade them from overthrowing the monarchy--a protection scheme that is shaky at best, given the hatred most citizens feel for the ruling family. To prevent economic disaster that could come from either a local uprising or an interruption in the flow of oil due to terrorism, Baer raises the possibility of the U.S. seizing the Saudi oil fields and forcing a regime change on its own terms: "An invasion and a revolution might be the only things that can save the industrial West from a prolonged, wrenching depression," he warns. </p><p>  <p>  Baer spent 21 years with the CIA, much of it in the Middle East, so he is an informed guide to this complex subject. His alarming book deserves to be read for raising many important and troubling questions.  --<I>Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>This is Robert Baer's second book and it is another essential read for every concerned Western citizen today.<P>His first book "See No Evil" was already shocking enough by demonstrating how security has been risked in the past for the sake of political correctness and other interests.<P>Baer has shown how insane the CIA politics was towards Middle East terrorism and everybody has seen the result on 9-11 and before in 1998 in Africa.<P>His latest book now turns it's attention towards the Pandora's Box of Muslim terrorism, Saudi Arabia. <P>I have spent about 10 months in the Midle East and I must say that Baer is one of the most credible sources I have ever read about the subject. He definetly knows what he is writing and talking about.<P>The reader will be shocked how far the US government is involved in the Saudi Oil biz and how it affects the "War on Terrorism" that has been promised to the public. <P>Whereas "See No Evil" was already terrifying enough by showing how highly dangerous men like Imad Mugnijah almost got away without the CIA doing anything, this book will definetly blow off the top. To see how far the US governemnt is involved in Saudi dirty politics whereas the Saudis are the treasure chest of almost any anti Western Muslim group is just shocking to the bone.<P>Tis book MUST be read by anyone, American or anyone who feels some sort of compassion for the survival of our culture and society.(Also read "Anger and Pride" by ORIANA FALLACI)</span>

                    <span>The author, a former CIA opperative, offers the reader a powerful and provactive view into the inner workings of one of America's closest allies. His exposure of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a despotic theocratic state, mired in the middle ages and roiling with anti-american terrorist furror, serves all Americans as a wake up call. While much of the American power elite want us to ignore the fact that most of the 9/11 hijackers and Bin Laden are Saudi, Baer persuasively explains how these terrorists, far from being aberations, are the logical result of the Anti-Western, anti-secular, anti-christian Saudi system maintained and sponsored by the House of Saud. Indeed, were it not for Saudi funding, Bin Laden would be a no one. Instead, American petro-dollars fill his purse.<P>Baer gives the only conclusion possible, America must rid itself of its crude oil addiction or continue to risk its economic security and its soul proping up this tyranical regime. Every American citizen needs to read this book as a wake up call.</span>

                    <span>After a couple chapters you may feel like you're reading a novel, instead of a real story about our Government and leaders from both sides of the isle. I can think of no matter more threatening to our security and standard of living. Were key portions of the Saudi Oil infrastructure destroyed, or the royal family overthrown - chaos and economic depression would almost certainly follow. All because our leaders are greedy fools, willing to put our future at risk to line their pockets.<P>This isn't crazy left wing propaganda, I'm a lifelong Republican. This issue is nonpartisan, both parties are responsible for making us dependent on the Saudis. Just how dependent is frightening and shocking to say the least.<P>Read it then act.</span>

                    <span>At first, I wasn't sure I liked this book as much as Mr. Baer's first book "See No Evil." The early part of the book seems to rant quite a bit. But, the more I thought about it, if I were Bob Baer, I'd be mad too...and all Americans should be. The more books I read about 9/11 and al-Qaeda, the more I feel that it didn't have to happen. Obviously, it is easy to look at things in hindsight and say that. Mr. Baer does an excellent job of showing just how involved the Saudis are in terrorism (besides the obvious fact that 15 of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi.) There are several scary aspects of al-Qaeda. What will happen when they attack again? What would happen if the House of Saud falls and radical Islam controls Saudi Arabia? What if the price of oil goes up to $145 a barrel? As usual, Mr. Baer writes in a very enjoyable style. The book makes for a fast read.</span>
