For anyone who wants<P>to . . . gain insight into the great cultural and political richness of Iran, past, present and future, this book is a marvelous introduction."<P><br>--Fred Halliday, Los Angeles Times<P>Iran was the first country in the Middle East to develop an oil industry, and oil has been central to its tumultuous twentieth-century history. A finalist for the PEN/West Award, Blood and Oil tells the epic inside story of the battle for Iranian oil. A prominent member of one of Iran's most powerful aristocratic families--so feared by Khomeini that the entire clan was blacklisted--Prince Manucher Farmanfarmaian was raised in a harem at the heart of Iran's imperial court. With wit and provocative detail, he describes the days when he served as the Shah's oil adviser and pioneered the partnership that resulted in OPEC. Beautifully written and epic in its scope, this scintillating memoir provides a fascinating history of modern Iran.<P>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinguished by its political acumen, historical sense, and vividness of description and anecdote. It is also notable for a wry sense of humour. . . . Amid the euphoria about the development of the oilfields of Central Asia and the Transcaucasus, [its] lesson should be kept in mind."  <br><P>--Anatol Lieven, Financial Times<P>"A book of stunning beauty . . . One of the best accounts of the cultural and political life of modern Iran, it is exquisite and intimate, rendered with art-istry and detail."<P>--Fouad Ajami</span>

                    <span>The author was a previleged and lucky child as he was born into a rich family in Iran and got all the usual perks that came with it. His memoirs regarding historical events in Iran are extremely subjective and the author has not bothered at all even to show a pretense of objectivity. This is not a book for a reader seeking historical knowledge about Iran but it is valuable for a more knowledgable reader to see the how life in Shah's Iran looked from the vantage view of a high official of that regime. For the knowledgable reader who actually knows what was life in Imperial Iran was like, the author provides a clear example of the total ignorance of ruling elite about the internal situation of Iran. The book also gives a clear indication of the "inferiority complex" that had inflicted the Iranian ruling elite where they had total disdain for Iranians and considered everything Western superior.</span>

                    <span>Historical review of British involvement is fascinating reading, especially the parts concerning the partnership disputes with the Persian government.<P>Analysis of political events is shallow particularly from an "insider". Reads more like an apologist making excuses for the Shah. Mostly attributes the unpopularity of the Shah to incompetent government and glosses over the terrible human rights abuses widely reported by Amnesty International on brutal treatment of political opponents of the Shah.<P>What is left out of this book would make for great reading. Author seems to have a very selective memory and appears to have quite the ego. Claims to be involved in too many critical events in recent Iranian history and always portrays himself as correctly predicting course of events.</span>

                    <span>In this book, an Iranian aristocrat tells a tale of his memories of Iran's turbulent development years in 20th century. The book is first and foremost a selective story of the author's experiences rather than an insightful look at Iran's government and politics. It is very selective and subjective in presenting events as to support the author's point of view and conclusions. The book by itself does not provide necessary historic background to understand the political events discussed and hence one should already have a good knowledge of Iran' s political history to be able to digest the information and viewpoints provided in Blood & Oil. This book does provide a good insight into Iranian aristocratic life under the Shahs and provides one insider's view of historic events in the oil boom years. The bardic writing style used is a delight to read and proves the prowess of the authors in story telling.</span>

                    <span>Blood and Oil elucidates the history of Iran and its twentieth century encounter with the West in a most objective manner. The book is based on the life of Manucher Farmanfarmaian, a prince of the Qajar Dynasty (overthown in the 1920's). The high offfices held by Mr. Farmanfarmaian, his father (a former Prime-minister), and his brothers (Generals, ministers, diplomats ...) gives him the unique ability to take the reader behind the closed doors of Iranian politics all the way through the 1979 Revolution. Overall, an objective and entertaining book of high historic and academic value.</span>
