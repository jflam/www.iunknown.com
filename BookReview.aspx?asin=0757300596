                <span id="Label1"><p>All of us, at one time or another, find ourselves inexplicably drawn to the sea. For some, it's a place for reflection or romance. For others, it's the thrill of watching surf crash against a sandy white beach or studying the kaleidoscope of life among a tropical coral reef. This ability of the ocean to change our lives, to inspire us and to fascinate us is what led us to create <i>Chicken Soup for the Ocean Lover's Soul</i>, a collection of stories from around the world that celebrate the magic of our ocean planet.</p> <p>The sea, from the beginning of time, has inspired great art and amazing stories. Our relationship with the ocean lies deep within our consciousness and, in fact, is in each of us. <i>Chicken Soup for the Ocean Lover's Soul</i> has captured some of these great stories to warm your heart and touch your soul. This book has amazing stories of swimming eye to eye with great whales, sharks and manatees, as well as legends of dolphins saving man.</p> <p>So get ready to dive in with Jack, Mark and Wyland, the world's most acclaimed marine-life artist, as they guide you on a journey of discovery and stories that will lift your spirit and awaken your senses like the healing sea itself. At last, a <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i> book for ocean lovers like you!</p></span>

                    <span>Wow! I received this book as a gift from a co-worker who knew I was a fan of the work of the artist Wyland. I had seen the Chicken Soup series for years, but found most of the stories to be a little too similar. This book was a VAST improvement and really deserves a look from anyone who thought the Chicken Soup series has burned itself out. I was particularly drawn to the story, "The Sea and the Wind that Blows," by E.B. White, the author of "Charlotte's Web." White, a long-time sailing aficionado, realizes for the first time that he is getting older and is becoming a risk to himself by sailing alone ... and must make a painful decision to give up his beloved pasttime. He ultimately decides that the point of life is to do what you love, and in so doing, decides to continue his sailing adventures, regardless of the consequences. It's a message for everyone who has ever considered giving up on something precious. The other stories are great too -- they come from around the entire world -- but are too numerous to explain in this review. This was simply a great gift that I will treasure as long as my paperback copy holds out.</span>

                    <span>This is a warm and wonderful book filled with stories, poems and art that will fill your heart with gladness. I can relate to many of these stories as I am a diver and a snorkeler, but anyone with a love for the ocean or even just a love for nature and life will find this book a treasure. I am going to order 3 more copies to give to my daughters and a friend because I don't wish to part with my own copy.</span>

                    <span>I'm not what you would call an "ocean lover" as the title of this book indicates, but my family and I used to visit the ocean on summer vacations in the gulf of Texas. I guess I had forgotten how wonderful those times were. But after reading Chicken Soup for the Ocean Lover's Soul, it was like being there again, building sandcastles on the beach with my father and brother, sharing my dreams for the future with my mother and contemplating the vast sea in front of us. There are some terrific stories here, including some by well-known authors, and the Wyland paintings are beautiful, but it's the stories by people like me, everyday people, with such touching memories of the sea that make this book a dear gift, indeed.</span>
