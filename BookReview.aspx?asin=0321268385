                    <span>The name of this book is a little deceptive as this is really the official FAQs for Eclipse plug-in developers.  The book is broken up into chapters with each chapter covering about 20 questions.  The first three chapters seem a bit unnecessary as they cover a general overview of Eclipse.  Most plug-in developers probably don't need the answers to those questions and most developers not trying their hand at plug-ins won't need the answers to the remaining 300 questions.  
<br />
<br />Starting with chapter 4, the book covers many of the questions that plug-in developers will have. The main sections are broken up into a look at the basics of the Rich Client platform including JFace and SWT and specifics on the Eclipse IDE platform.  Workbench, editors, perspectives, and views are covered in the general part.  The next part goes into more specific details of the Workspace and Resources API and the Java Development Tool API, among other topics.  The questions are arranged well so rather than a random collection of questions, each chapter is very readable.  Supporting screen shots and source code are provided as needed.  The questions selected cover many of the more confusing areas of plug-in development.  The answers are well written and easy to follow.  
<br />
<br />The book includes a CD that can be installed as an Eclipse plug-in so that the answers will always be nearby even when a co-worker borrows your copy of the book.  Overall, this book is a valuable aid to have nearby while doing plug-in development.

                    <span>I was expecting just raw FAQs but what I got was thoughtful, well organized, and reminiscent of one of O'Rielly's Cookbook style books. Screenshots are kept to a minimum and used effectively. UML diagrams are used to explain object relationships. The code samples are kept reasonably small. And the content of the FAQs themselves cover relevant and important issues. For those looking to use Eclipse as a development platform, or extend Eclipse with plugins this book is definitely worth the look.</span>

                    <span>I've spent many hours both using Eclipse and dissecting its source code, so I wasn't sure what I'd learn, if anything, from this book. It didn't take long, however, before I found myself saying, "Really? Eclipse does that?" and racing to Eclipse to verify items this book teaches. And yes, everything I've tried from the book does indeed work.
<br />
<br />Time was, you could click your way through an IDE to discover its capabilities. After all, IDEs did little more than collect your source files together with a way to edit the files, build your program, and launch or debug your creation. Eclipse goes way beyond that, however, and you'll not likely tap all its power and capabilities by simply hunting and clicking. To leave Eclipse's abilities dormant would be a real shame, too, because Eclipse will honestly help you code much faster.
<br />
<br />Yes, you'll already know some of the things this book teaches. Your set of previously-known items won't match my set, however, and all the items in the book merit inclusion. Unless you already know everything there is to know about Eclipse, you will learn something new--something that elevates your usage of Eclipse.</span>

                    <span>For those Eclipse users amongst you, this recent book may be a useful extension of your physical library. The authors have assembled 361 FAQs under one cover. These pertain to the latest major stable release, 3.0. In the jargon of O'Reilly, a major competitor to this publisher, the book is the equivalent of one of their "100 Hacks" books on some computing topic. But here offering over 3 times more tips.
<br />
<br />The book is designed for random access. Each FAQ is titled with a question that the FAQ then answers. So the directory pages should suffice in guiding you to an answer, if it exists, of course. Each FAQ's explanation can be read in isolation of the others. Though one very nice feature is how they cross reference each other where appropriate. The old fashioned equivalent of hyperlinks, remember?
<br />
<br />The technical level is moderate. You are required to have the rudiments of Java. It is not the authors' remit to teach this to you. But if you have this background, the book should be intelligible.
<br />
<br />Of course, the entire book could be online. But some will prefer this hardcopy.</span>
