                    <span>I was honored to have been able to assist Bob Dorr in the creation of this book with photographs from my Presidential collection. With superb text in all aspects, the selected photos certainly aid in providing a reader the clearest look yet at the aviation fleet devoted to serving the President as he conducts national and international business.<P>AIR FORCE ONE by Robert F. Dorr is by far is the best review yet of the history, types of aircraft and logistics essential to the safe and timely travel by our Chief Executive and an impressive display of American prestige.</span>

                    <span>Any student of aviation or U.S. history will enjoy this flight through sixty years of presidential transport. In an attractive package crammed with beautiful portraits of the world's most-recognized airplane, author Robert Dorr turns his encyclopedic knowledge of civil and military aviation to chronicling the evolution of this American flagship of the skies. From the converted military cargo planes used by FDR during World War II, to the gleaming prop-driven Constellation favored by Ike, to the historic Boeing 707 that carried JFK in life and death, Dorr shows how these airplanes came to embody American power and prestige in their global travels. While he covers the technical details of each aircraft and shows how the President's plane evolved with civil and military aviation advances, the book also provides glimpses into presidential character. Nixon, for example, was polite but reserved on his jet, and almost never ventured up to the cockpit. LBJ treated his fleet of aircraft like flying offices, wheeling and dealing with congressmen and politicians as he corralled them into flights to their districts or to his Texas ranch. President Reagan was a favorite of his flight crews, and returned their respect with casual visits to their communications and flight stations. Jimmy Carter, uncomfortable with the imperial aura of Air Force One, removed the "V" (for VIP) prefix from its official VC-137 designation. He also exasperated his radio operators on occasion by discussing classified information "in the clear" (as was his prerogative, of course). The changes in Air Force One parallel many of the advances in air transport technology since the late 1930's, and reflect the changing role of the presidency over six decades. Air Force One has served as private jet and potential doomsday command post. Today it's a global ambassador of American power. Robert Dorr does justice to his subject with clear writing and the behind-the-scenes access that take readers inside this fascinating aircraft. His book is almost as good as a ride on the 747 that now carries President George W. Bush.</span>

                    <span>There are a lot of words between these two covers, but I was especially taken by the photos --- especially those which show the special area at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, where AIR FORCE ONE, the president's plane, lives.<P>This is really two books in one. It's partly what's going on today, including some inner secrets. It's also partly a history of presidential air travel. The author tells what happened to AIR FORCE ONE on September 11, 2001, and he also recounts the past experiences of presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the first to fly while in office.</span>

                    <span>"Air Force One," by Robert F. Dorr has beautiful pictures, nice binding, and an attractive dust jacket.<P>But it's filled with facts, some current (post 9-11), some historical. The amazing thing is, it reveals the secret, secondary purpose of this aircraft. As a retired military officer, I was surprised to learn about "continuity of government" plans, C-20C war readiness plans, and the role of the president's Boeing 747 as a flying command post in time of war. The first chapter of the book deals with Air Force One on September 11, 2001.<P>I detected one or two minor typos in the book. The discussion about alternatives to the current 747 aircraft seemed a little strained. Still, this is a great account of what's going on today with presidential air travel and of what happened in the past.</span>
