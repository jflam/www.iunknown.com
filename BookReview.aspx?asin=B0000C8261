                    <span>What I like  about this World Series dvd is Bob Costas's narration, it's obvious that Bob loves baseball and he has a way to explain what we see with enthousiasm.  I was REALLY surprised and exited when I saw Grover Cleveland Alexander come out of the bullpen in the 7th inning of the 7th game in the 1926 WS. Seeing that Lazerri at-bat vs Alexander was a dream come true.</span>

                    <span>I rented the "100 Years of the World Series" DVD and will be purchasing it from Amazon.  The show covers every World Series since 1903, when it began to 2002.  And we're not talking a 10 second mention per World Series.  The show is approximately 3 1/2 hours long, so each series is given a fair amount of time, especially the more recent years as the participants are still alive to give their recollections.  The great video clips, even from the first decade of the century, make it a terrific show. The best part for me was the segment on the 70s, which was when I discovered the game.  Lots of great memories.  Bob Costas narrates and he does a great job as he doesn't "wax poetic", which he has a tendency to do in his everyday job.
<br />
<br />There are interviews shown with Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Pete Rose, Tommy Lasorda, Dennis Eckersley, Joe DiMaggio, Leo Durocher, Eldon Auker (a pitcher for Detroit in the 30s, a very entertaining storyteller), Kirk Gibson, Derek Jeter, Tom Glavine, Jim Palmer, Sandy Koufax and on and on.  
<br />
<br />I've seen many sports documentaries and this one will be the one in which they are all judged in the future!</span>

                    <span>The best thing about this DVD is that it covers each World Series, not by skimming over it, but by detailed discussion.  This causes the DVD to be several hours which is a good thing becuase you can't sum up the history of the World Seriest in an hour.  Overall this a great DVD that every commited baseball fan should own.</span>

                    <span>This 2DVD set is an incredible value -- it has over 5 1/2 hours of great footage for around 15 bucks.  Whoever put this documentary together did a tremendous job of coming up with basically all of the actual footage of key plays and moments in the history of the World Series that you could ask for (even all the way back to the beginning), and tracked down interview footage from the key participants. I rated the 2DVD Yankee history set as also being essential -- basically, this makes an excellent companion.  The World Series set might appeal to baseball fans in general a bit more, because even though it has tons of Yankee footage (obviously), there is of footage of most of the guys you'd want to see (Mays, Aaron, Bonds, Williams, Brooklyn Dodgers/NY Giants, etc.)  Very compelling viewing, whether you're a novice fan or someone who has seen decades worth of baseball - it brought back a ton of great memories and makes you realize how often there are really great, historic moments in virtually every Series.</span>

                    <span>As a big baseball fan and huge Dodger fan, this video tells us houw great the game of baseball is and how the World Series has changed not only sports in general, but this nation and even the world. It shows us how powerful this event is that not even  wars, terrorist attacks and an earthquake can stop the importance of this game (maybe a labor dispute). Bob Costas does a great job on narrating this film and the interviews from players, broadcasters and historians give us a clear view on how the game was played during that year. One thing that did dissapoint me was the lack of credit for Fernando Valenzuela in the 1981 Series, He was not only ROY and CY winner, but helped the Dodgers capture their title that year. another thing was that I was expecting to see the 2003 World Series, but I am sure this video came out before that. Other than that, the video is a must for every baseball fan. Hope the World Series lasts another 100 years....after all, its alot more exciting than the other overhyped championship game with the roman numerals and fancy halftime shows and special commercials</span>
