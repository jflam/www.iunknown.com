                <span id="Label1">Motherhood is the world's most demanding - and rewarding - job.  It's a calling that comes with incredible highs and gut-wrenching lows.  How to express both the joys and challenges inherent in parenting the next generation in a way that is guaranteed to leave your audience smiling with tears in their eyes?  Leave it to the one and only Bradley Trevor Greive.  In this moving and yet often side-splittingly funny homage to mothers everywhere, the best-seliing author has masterfully paired his insightful prose with humorous animal photograpphy that quickly and succinctly sums up his narrative's loving nuances.  A mother tiger nuzzling her cub.  A basset hound with an ice bag on her head.  All are fodder and focus for BTG's unique wit and wisdom. From birth to toddlers to teenagers, The Incredible Truth About Motherhood covers the many stops and starts children make on their journey to adulthood and describes how devoted mothers are both teacher and student. Of course, the book ends with a heartfelt "I love you, Mom!" on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of readers who will buy it as a Mother's Day gift.  Bradley Trevor Greive's previous books have been enthusiastically received in over two dozen countries throughout the world, attracting millions of readers with his trademark combination of engaging animal photography, gentle humor, and priceless perceptions. Dear Mom, for example, has sold nearly half a million copies in the year since it was published.  The Incredible Truth About Motherhood should likewise rocket to the top of best-seller lists all over the planet.</span>

                    <span>This book is very good like his other ones, BUT he chose to use language that I consider foul several times in this book. I bought this book for my Mom and 3 other friends but am going to return them. Unfortunate because we considered buying in bulk and passing out to mothers at church on Mothers day. In my opinion he could have made his point quite clear using words that the average mother uses and want their children using.</span>

                    <span>I just read another review from an expecting woman with her first child and was sad to hear that she was depress after reading this fabulous book. Honestly women have no idea to what being a MOTHER is until you are one!!! this book was a blessing to me as now I know that in some aspects of raising a child, I am not the only one who thinks that some days are horrible! I am buying these books for my mohter & mother in law this year for mothers day and I know that since they are MOTHERS they will be able to understand and appreciate this book and reflect on the wonderfull journey that they have as MOTHERS! THIS BOOK MAKES MOTHERS HAPPY EVEN WHEN THE GOING IS TOUGH AND I RECCOMEND THAT YOU GET IT FOR ALL YOUR MOTHERS!!!</span>

                    <span>I love every book this man has put out! The pictures are priceless but then you add the little comments at the bottom and they become hysterical. I found the comment from the lady who's mom bought her the book because she was expecting her first child very comical and have a feeling that once she has that child, she will find the humor in the book because almost every single page has happened at one point or another if you have children. Kids are hard work but they are also the single most important thing you'll ever do and are an endless source of joy. I give these books as gifts a lot and they always bring a smile and most of the time, burtst of laughter.</span>
