                    <span>This book is a good summary of the "Co-Active Coaching Training" program conducted by the Coaching Training Institute.  Unfortunately, it doesn't (or can't possibly) act as a substitute for the program.  The training itself is based heavily on experiential learning that can't be delivered in a book.  The book is useful as a reference, especially for those fortunate enough to have gone through the CTI program, and also for those thinking about signing up for the program.  It might be difficult to use the model or some of the tools without the patience to figure out the jargon, but none the less, there is valuable information.  One example is the "powerful questions" reference section that will benefit anyone trying to coach effectively.</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellently written basics course on coaching. It focus' each of us on the tasks we know are important but sometimes neglect the subtle nature of doing it effectively. For example, listening, intuition, or what level of candor is appropriate. Read it and then keep it as a refresher when ever you feel you are off your coaching game.</span>

                    <span>I have been interested in coaching as a home based business for several months, and this book helped me get a clear picture of how to set up a method-based approach to coaching others.</span>

                    <span>As a life coach this is THE book that I recommend for anyone interested in learning more about coaching.  The authors' philosophy that the relationship between a coach and client is a designed alliance is powerful and well articulated throughout the book.  Each chapter is packed with information, tools and examples on coaching from the co-active model.  It's also one of the few books I keep on my bookshelf in my office and I refer to it often.</span>

                    <span>As I began my training as a Personal and Executive Coach, I was searching for a book that could provide both theoretical and practical instruction for coaching.  I found both in this book.  The authors detail the philosophy behind this collaborative coaching model as well as provide practical solutions for coaches such as worksheets, etc. that clients can fill out.  I can't imagine getting to the point I am out without this book, and highly recommend it to any coach at any stage in training.</span>
