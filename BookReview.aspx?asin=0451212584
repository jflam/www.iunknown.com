                    <span>Tug McGraw was a bonafide original.  From his thigh slap to his screwball to his love of a good time, Tug did things his way.  But as he says during the book, sometimes his way was the selfish way.  The most compelling part of the book for me was him discussing his relationship with his son Tim.  From refusing to acknowledge his fatherhood to completely ignoring him (other than one visit in Houston) to finally coming around and taking responsibilty for himself and his son.  
<br />
<br />That's a main theme in this book, taking responsibility.  Unlike his ex-teammate Pete Rose who seemingly blamed everyone under the sun for his problems other than himself, Tug steps up and admits his mistakes.  He says that he was not a good husband or father.  He was determined not to make the same mistakes with his youngest son Matthew.  His children all rallied around him as he battled brain cancer.
<br />
<br />Sadly this story doesn't have a happy ending as Tug passes away in January of 2004, a month before this book was released.  The final chapter of this book is very touching as Don Yaeger describes Tug's final days.  This book shows that it's never too late to say you're sorry and it's never too late to make things right.  An excellent book, highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Wow!  I'm not a baseball fan, or a Tug McGraw fan for that matter, but I read this book in a day.  I love, love, love Tug's son Tim McGraw and it was amazing to read how Tug treated his children, Tim especially and they way Tim loved Tug so unconditionally-even paying for his medical bills, rent, furnishing a home for his father and spending hours on end just holding Tug's hand in Tug's final days.  It makes me an even bigger fan of Tims.  Tug's own childhood/family life was heartbreaking to read about, as well.  The baseball parts were interesting, but not very exciting for me, as I am not a big fan of the sport, but baseball fans will definitely enjoy this book.
<br />There are some great pictures in the book also.</span>

                    <span>In 1973 "Ya Gotta Believe" became the rallying cry of the unlikely National League champions, the New York Mets.  At the center of this unbelievable group of overachievers was the author of that expression, Tug McGraw.  This phrase, which drove the Mets to within one game of winning the World Series would, ironically become his personal battle cry in his fight against cancer nearly thirty years later.<br>     McGraw speaks very candidly about his life in his autobiography, Ya Gotta Believe My Roller Coaster Life as a Screwball Pitcher and Part-time Father, and My Hope Filled Fight Against Brain Cancer.  From his less than perfect upbringing, to his wild antics on and off the field, to his strained relationship with his oldest son, country music superstar Tim McGraw, he holds nothing back.  He readily admits to the mistakes that he made during his life.<br>     To his credit McGraw was attempting to make amends for his past indiscretions.  Over the last several years he had established a relationship with Tim, whom he had previously not acknowledged as his son.  Most important to Tug McGraw was trying to succeed as a father to his youngest son Matthew, something that he had had not accomplished at with his other three children.  <br>     McGraw was also beginning to edge his way back in baseball, as a spring training coach for the Philadelphia Phillies.  This job meant a bit more stability toward his financial stature, which like the other aspects of his life, were less than perfect.  He was beginning to turn the corner and improving his life by healing relationships which he had previously damaged.  That all changed in March of 2003.  McGraw was diagnosed with brain cancer and given three weeks to live.  It was then that "Ya Gotta Believe" took on a whole new meaning.  Family, friends and former teammates rushed to his side as his trademark slogan became his inspirational motto as he took on the fiercest adversary that he had ever faced.  <br>     The autobiography follows his life from growing up in California, through his rise to a Major League Baseball career, to his untimely death in January 2004.  The book serves as a testimony of a man who accepted what was dealt to him and fought admirably to defeat the cancer that would eventually consume him.  <br>   Most importantly the book is a testimony of the power of forgiveness.  McGraw's children rushed to their father's side at his moment of need, forgetting his past indiscretions.  Tim McGraw, now with the financial means to provide for his father, did so without reservation.  How ironic for him to extend this to a man who refused to do this for him and ignored his existence.    <br>     The book is enjoyable for not only baseball fans and cancer survivors, but for fans of life in general.  It is an inspiring and emotional story that will bring both tears to your eyes and a smile to your face.  McGraw seems to use the book as a means to seek forgiveness from the fans and a request for a second chance in the waning moments of his life.</span>

                    <span>If you loved Tug McGraw and the things he did for the Met's and Phillies, you will love this book.<p>Tug brings us through his life, from a disruptive youth to a challenging career in baseball away from his family with the thought behind his mind that another child may have been his.  This book is so timely coming so soon after Tug McGraw's demise from cancer.  <p>He reviews his loves, his relationships with his families, teammates and fans and his struggles after retiring from baseball.<p>One chapter that is fascinating is the chapter devoted to fans.... It is a fitting tribute to his fans from someone who always enjoyed playing for them.<p>Tug admits in this book his wild lifestyle as a baseball player and attributes part of it to his somewhat wild homelife growing up.  McGraw shows how he was the life of the party, a team player and a person who inspired others.  <p>His sense of humor was amazing.  His vignettes about his jokes throughout the book will make you smile.  He even devotes a chapter to his humor.  <p>You will cry as you hear about Tug's challenges in his life and most of all the last few years of his life struggling with his illness.  Yet, Tug's legacy would not be complete without his family and it is touching and fitting what he says about them.<p>Interestingly Tug talks about three heroes of his; Babe Ruth, Benjamin Franklin and the King; Elvis.  He tells us why these men's lives had an impact on his life.  Tug shows that he was a deep person, with a depth of passion for his life, his family and his work.  The discussion of Ben Franklin was so very interesting.  <p>This book is for anyone who has come from a challenged family background, anyone who loves the music of Tim McGraw, and of course the many fans who enjoyed the life of one of America's favorite Relief Pitchers - Tug McGraw......Ya Gotta Believe.</span>

                    <span>If you want the PG version buy "Screwball", this is not a book that the twelve year old me could have or should have handled.  However, as an adult it is quite the eye opening view into what life in and after professional sports is really like.  Tug was and is my hero for many reasons, but this book showed me that even heroes do not have perfect lives with perfect outcomes.  I cried at the end, even though I knew how it ended.  It was a lot like "Brian's Song" in that regard.  I am not a big fan of country music, but Tug's son Tim has a new fan, not because of his singing, but because of his truely generous and loving spirit.</span>
