                <span id="Label1">This book is a guide to Lake Powell, which has formed behind the Glen Canyon Dam in the middle part of the Colorado River.  The dam is located in extreme northern Arizona, near the town of Page, but 99.9% of Lake Powell is in Utah.  It has a shoreline of 2900 kms or 1800 miles.   <P> The emphasis of this book is on hiking with boater access.  Also covered are potential campsites, geology, history of the early pioneers and cattlemen; the ones who came to build trails, look for minerals, and explore.  Excerpts from the John W. Powell and the Dominquez & Escalante expedition diaries have been added in the appropriate locations, plus archeological sites and their history are documented using studies from the Universities of Utah and Northern Arizona from the 1950's, before the lake covered many of the sites.   There are 43 mapped areas, which show inlets and the canyons above, and hiking and camping information.  Shown on these maps are Anasazi ruins, petroglyphs, and other information for mostly day-hiking.  All sections of the lake are included, from Cataract Canyon in the upper end, to the San Juan Arm; plus the Escalante River drainage and its many great hiking canyons, and Rainbow Bridge, the one of the largest in the world.  There are also lots of great slot canyons with boater access only; these include West Canyon, maybe the best all-around canyon hike on the Colorado Plateau.  This 2nd Updated (3rd) Edition has 251 fotographs, including 10 color fotos on the front & back covers.</span>

                    <span>From what I can tell, Kelsey appears to be the foremost authority on Lake Powell and the surrounding area. I can't see how you could get more information out of another book. That being said, it isn't the kind of book you read cover to cover for sheer enjoyment of reading and learning. Think of it as a user manual for the lake and you will be on the right track. There are a lot of pictures (in black and white) and a lot of very detailed maps and informative graphs. To use this book, I would suggest that you plan your trip and then consult the book to see what it says about that area. If there is ANYTHING of interest to be seen there, it will tell you where and what it is. <P>It is divided into the following parts:<BR>I - Condensed history of the lake area (19 pages) - very fact filled (survey like).<BR>II - The marinas on Lake Powell and other possible launch sites along with weather and climate for each season, a word about hiking season and equipment, photography and film type, insects and pest, drinking water, and places to camp and their fees.<BR>III - Geology, the types of stone seen in the colorful strata and suggested maps for the area. <P>Then it launches into sites of interest in the area and gives good maps (quite technical) of each. There are 34 of these and may well cover all of the canyons and hikes on the lake. If you want to get the most out of your trip, I would highly recommend this book. If you were wanting to just read about the history of the area, it will be about as much fun as reading the dictionary.</span>

                    <span>?¥¬ Lake Powell 2-5 times per year and keep our boat there. We live in Littleton. <P>I have used the book for a number of years. It is accurate and consequently useful to someone who wants information for on the ground activities or historical significance.<P>It gives an idea of shore conditions for camping which is helpful in new areas.<P>We use it to explore and plan hiking trips. We do enjoy hiking. Its the most comprehesive book out there on Lake Powell and we have a number of Lake Powell Books.<P>If you want somthing very simple for lake exploration then go with the Stan Jone map. It to is an excellent tool.</span>

                    <span>Overall this isn't a bad book. However, I do agree with other reviewers who feel it is difficult to use. Mr. Kelsey is an avid hiker and outdoorsman. The hikes in this book are all pretty intense and not for your average person. My major complaint about the book is that terrain at the beginning of most of the hikes up from the lake shore varies greatly depending on the water level. I know that this isn't Mr. Kelsey's fault and I certainly don't blame him, but he could give you a little warning. When we went (early May 2001) the water level was about 27 feet below full pool. At that point the beginning of some of his hikes may actually be 1/2 kilometer earlier than he states. In addition, getting to his starting point may be a whole lot more involved. (On one hike, it took us over an hour just to get to where he had the hike starting, due to low water level, lots of mud which was almost like quicksand and the need to hike up slickrock to get around all this).</span>

                    <span>I wanted a houseboating guide to Lake Powell. Although this book is full of detail about every inch of the lake, it is absolutely NOT user-friendly. The print is minute and the writing is atrocious. All of the maps are small and cluttered, and look as if they were done on somebody's home PC. All of the references are metric, which makes it extremely tedious to decipher. Although there is a metric conversion table at the begining, it was very frustrating to have to keep refering back to it. If you are looking for a basic, easy to follow guide, this is not the book for you! If I had picked it up in a book store and thumbed through it, I never would have bought it.</span>

                    <span>We've used all 3 editions on 4 houseboat trips. From the descriptions of what to see, we decide on which canyons to visit. We use the detailed maps to navigate to the beach campsites. We use the trail descriptions to reach arches, waterfalls, petroglyphs, pictographs, ruins and narrow slot canyons. Things we used from the latest edition: new cost and time info on famous Antelope Canyon, more detailed directions on locating the petroglyphs in Llewellyn Gulch, and new info on upper West (slot) Canyon. I recommend this Guide to anyone boating on Lake Powell. Not recommended for extremists who want to drain the lake!</span>
