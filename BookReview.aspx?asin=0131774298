                <span id="Label1">Defying the stereotypical notion that technical books tend to be boring, <I>Expert C Programming</I> offers a lively and often humorous look at many aspects of C--from how memory is laid out to the details of pointers and arrays. The author reveals his points through invaluable anecdotes, such as stories of costly bugs, and through folklore, such as the contents of Donald Knuth's first publication. Each chapter ends with a section entitled "Some Light Relief," which discusses topics (topics that some may consider to be "recreational"), such as programming contests. A fabulous appendix on job interview questions finishes the book.</span>

                    <span>With all the "Modern C++ Design" hype these days, its good to get back to the basics. 
<br />
<br />One reviewer mentioned that the book was possibly dated. While I think this a fair point, the amount of history in this book is actually a plus. The first chapter on C's origins is worth the price alone. For example how many books explain how some of C's operators have the wrong precedence?
<br />
<br />While the C++ section of the book is rather limited. The quirks, bugs and gotchas outlined in the C section of this book still exist in C++, and in my experience account for 90% of the problems in C++ code (hence the title of this review). Also its meaningless to try and study advanced C++ features without knowing how C works.
<br />
<br />Van Der Linden's writing style is excellent, very readable with heavy technical areas broken up well with amusing and relevant anecdotes.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend this book to any intermediate to advanced C/C++ programmers who want more of in a insight into why things are the  way they are, or who want broader understanding of the internals that make up these languages.
<br />
<br />BTW Modern C++ Design is also an excellent book - but you can't really appreciate Picasso without knowing a bit about Goya. </span>

                    <span>I agree with another reader that this is not a truly advanced C book. A serious student of C would also do well to buy Harbison and Steele (as Van Der Linden himself suggests). But I utterly disagree with the angry conclusion of the earlier reviewer. The fact is that this is a gem of a book! The chapter Unscrambling Declarations in C and his two chapters clarifying the relationship between arrays and pointers are masterful. The book is also packed with amusing anecdotes that help to maintain interest. I have programmed in C for many years and I would call this a must-have book.</span>

                    <span>This book should have been called "Stupid Mistakes You Will Make In C the First Two Months @ Work". There is nothing expert about this book and the author is (...)claiming to be an expert himself. He wrote this book as part of Sun's push to get JAVA more market share. I have been writing C code for 15 years and as my review of Sept 11th, 1998 makes clear, I find this book offensive for its pretention and lack of substance. The correct title of this book would be "Fireplace Starter". If you can find it, try Harbison and Steele's book instead. Study the standard library carefully and emulate it. You will soon find yourself a good C programmer. (hint: if you are returning integers from functions, instead of pointers, you haven't gotten "it" yet. Study the string functions and you'll see what I mean.)</span>
