                <span id="Label1">As little children we know how to live in the moment and be completely authentic. But then something damaging happens to us, according to author Don Miguel Ruiz: we are given "knowledge" about how to live in the world. Parents tell us how to behave in order to be a "good" boy or girl. Teachers tell us what it takes to be a "winner" or a "successful" adult. This collective "voice of knowledge" is not only false--it is often poisonous, explains Ruiz, bestselling author of <I>The Four Agreements</I>. It makes us believe that "I am not the way I should be; it is not okay to be me." Drawing upon the story of Adam and Eve, Ruiz refers to the forbidden tree of knowledge and likens the abandonment of the true self to the fall from heaven. What Ruiz calls "the voice of knowledge" others spiritual teachers might call ego--the hidden and carefully defended belief system that prevents us from living and expressing who we really are. "The structure of our knowledge makes us feel safe&#133;.When we discover that we are not what we believe we are, the foundation of our entire reality begins to collapse." In the Toltec tradition, Ruiz says every human is an artist, "and the supreme art is the expression of the beauty of our spirit." He explains that there are two kinds of artists: "the ones who create their story without awareness, and the ones who recover awareness and create their story with truth and love." The recovering of awareness is what this fourth book in the <I>Toltec Wisdom</I> series is all about.  This makes for a good bedside spiritual growth book. Each chapter closes with "Points to Ponder"--summary thoughts to sleep upon as you create the more authentic story of your life. <I>--Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>Everyone has a constant rhythm of talking in their head. Sometimes it seems as though that voice is never quiet. It is constantly telling us things. Usually things we already know. Miguel Ruiz calls this the Voice of Knowledge or the "prince of lies." The voice of knowledge knows everything about you and everyone else or so it would like to have you believe.
<br />
<br />Miguel Ruiz's latest book The Voice of Knowledge focuses on that voice. The majority of what the voice says is negative; even if you think it's positive it probably isn't as positive as you would think. Ruiz wants us to be able to understand how the voice works so we can better control it. Most of what it says is useless information. This negative voice is what causes the majority of people to seek releases elsewhere with alcohol, drugs or even food.
<br />
<br />To better explain how the voice works, Ruiz uses personal anecdotes. Right from the beginning I was on guard. I have a problem with knowledge being looked at as a bad thing and a great part of the opening was about how bad knowledge is. It wasn't until later he confirmed knowledge isn't the problem, "the problem is what contaminates it." Another thing about the opening that bothered me was his comment that his perspective may or may not be true because it was from his perspective.
<br />
<br />I continued to swim in and out of skepticism as I read. According to Ruiz our head is full of lies and everyone is always trying to inflict their story on us and us on them. I put him in this category as well. He's just another story teller trying to tell us what we are doing wrong with our lives. Supposedly, once we are able to understand this we'll stop trying to control things we have no control over: each other.
<br />
<br />A big part of his book is about faith. He wants readers to regain their lost faith in themselves, their lives, the world and most of all in love.
<br />
<br />Half way through I had a Dr. Phil book plug moment when Ruiz brought up his other book, The Four Agreements. This section seemed more like a long advertisement for this book which was disappointing. The information is also available on his website.
<br />
<br />At certain points the book becomes "God" preachy but I survived and feel one step closer to quieting the prince of lies. The Voice of Knowledge is a very short book and is very repetitive in trying to get its main points across. Basically knowledge is bad, don't believe yourself and don't believe other people. I felt like he was dancing around what he really wanted to say but that could be me imposing my story on his. Or maybe not.
<br />
<br />Ruiz didn't offer many suggestions for quieting the voice other than wordless music or prayer (he provided a couple in the back of the book.) He also didn't make any promises that you could. Everyone's different and the way they control their voices I expect it is also different.
<br />
<br />As you can see I'm a bit resistant to most of the book. On a positive note, I did find myself more aware of my voice. With that awareness I was able to quiet it more than I have in a while. With that there is a feeling of peace. The kind you get when the kids are away for the day and there are no appointments in your day planner. Now that my scepticism has wavered slightly I'd like to re-read The Voice of Knowledge again with my new perspective.
<br />
<br />If this is something you want to do then this book will help. If you are looking for a miracle to inner peace well I think you'd be better off searching elsewhere.

                    </div>
                    <span>I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much from Ruiz's fourth book on his philosophy. The ideas expounded upon in The Four Agreements and its companion volume are simple enough that I didn't really think much more could be done with them. Also, Ruiz seems to have progressively picked up more New Age buzzwords since his first book, and the samples I'd seen of this work suggested that it might be fluffier than his previous writings. Still, I hadn't been disappointed by one of his books yet, so I added it to my wish list and received it as a gift. And I really think it may be his best work to date.
<br />
<br />The Voice of Knowledge doesn't dazzle at the beginning. It does have some fluff to open with, but as with his other books, the narrative progresses into crystal clarity, almost completely free of superfluous elements. Thankfully Ruiz never falls into the abyss of misusing the New Age vocabulary as a substitute for real content. The focus is a little more autobiographical, and one of its most engaging aspects is that the whole thing reads like a story, even where the biographical elements are not the focus. This alone makes it an exceptional piece on Ruiz's part.
<br />
<br />But more compelling to me is that somewhere along the way--I can't place where--I found the narrative prodded something in me, stirred it up something fierce. The ideas in The Four Agreements have been incredibly useful to me in recent years, but few things have had the ability to really stir something up in my psyche as this work has.
<br />
<br />I'll note that I generally loathe inspirational works, as their usual purpose is to make you feel good and leave you with very little real benefit. The Voice of Knowledge is a rare work that finds that perfect balance between theory, practicality, and inspiration--inspiration that exhilarates and engages rather than that which merely placates.</span>

                    <span>Another precious literature from Don Miguel Ruiz.  "The Voice of Knowledge" is another book that brings us to be the greatest artist in life.  It is an excellent companion book after you have read "The Four Agreements" and "The Four Agreements Companion Book".  Don Miguel Ruiz's books are meant to be read over and over again to help us deepen our understanding of the truth in life that leads us to live in the heaven.
<br />
<br />That voice, the voice of knowledge, those lies, those old agreements, those false beliefs we adopted from the past during the domestication process when we were a child, are always talking and judging.  These voices talk very loud in our head to convince us we are not good enough.  However, the voices are lies and we believe in those lies.  We walk through life day after day believing we need others to validate and provide us the self-esteem.  We walk through life day after day looking for external gratification to satisfy that voice.
<br />
<br />I like Don Miguel Ruiz's stories, particularly his interpretation of the Bible about Adam and Eve, his personal experience in the dessert and his story with his grandpa.
<br />
<br />I like Don Miguel Ruiz's interpretation about the fallen angel (the snake that lives in that tree in Eden, which is called the tree of knowledge).  The snake symbolizes our own judgment, fear, anger and ego while the tree symbolizes the book of law.  The snake goes on talking in your head starting the day Adam and Eve ate the apple, which to me is a symbolism of us adopting the voice of knowledge.  The paradise we lived in turned out to be the hell, where mankind suffers.  We are all trapped in the cycle of judgment, fear, anger and ego and day after day, we think that satisfying these feelings are the way to happiness.  The snake wants to survive in your head, it will always talk.  However, we have the power to turn that voice into love and compassion.  
<br />
<br />The night in the dessert helps me understand whatever we see at the moment is a reflection of light.  Our brain perceives the light and makes its own interpretation.  I think Don Miguel Ruiz brought us the truth here.  You might think you know someone well.  You do not understand why that someone hurts you deep.  It is simply because people are also the reflection of light.  We only see the reflection of others and we only understand the projected self of others.  Asking the question "why" certain things happen is nonsense, because we will never know the truth.  The truth only comes from within self and happiness comes from within.
<br />
<br />Don Miguel Ruiz's story with the grandpa is empowering.  I respect the author telling us his personal story about how he turned his deamon (his ego, and his past in projecting a false image to others) into the voice of truth.  It is a powerful message and his story raised my level of awareness about self and about my own ego in the past which controlled my life.  Thank you for the author's guidance.  When you read this book with an open heart, I am sure you can find the road to happiness yourself.

                    <span>Don Miguel Ruiz writes a brillant short insightful book with information that pours out of his glass of truth like common sense and deep pardoxically occuring at once. This book has the chance to change your life. Why? You are already searching. You are reading my review searching, and the mere process of searching is what this book is about. Reading this book provides a vehicle to spiritually and/or intellectually ask the big questions of life. 
<br />Why are we here? 
<br />Is there a higher power? 
<br />
<br />As he puts it in his book...it's all in us from birth. What is? Peace. Joy. Bliss. Tranquility. Happiness. Are you ready to take the journey?

                    <span>This book, one of a collection building on Ruiz's "The Four Agreements" is well worth the read. Greatly expands on the knowlege sections in "The Agreements", making the original clearer and firmer in the mind. Plenty of reviews here that delve into content, just a note of recommendation.</span>
