                <span id="Label1"><p> In <i>Bloody Sundays, </i>award-winning sportswriter Mike Freeman delivers an eye-opening appraisal of football, capturing the complexities and controversies of America's new national pastime </p> <p> With fascinating insights, Freeman goes beyond day-to-day newspaper journalism and ESPN highlights to take us deep inside the game and reveal the NFL in ways that will surprise even the most avid football fans. He travels to the sidelines and into the locker rooms to interview hundreds of players and coaches on their expertise. Breaking the game down to its three essential elements -- coaching, offense, and defense -- Freeman profiles in depth three of today's football elite: Jon Gruden, head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Michael Strahan, defensive end for the New York Giants; and Emmitt Smith, the legendary running back. </p> <p> Packed with football history and anecdotes, Bloody Sundays goes behind the scenes of the "secret society" of gay players who play in fear of their lives and careers. Freeman offers an exclusive and disturbing look at the life of a current player, the first time an active player addresses homosexuality and the warrior culture NFL. </p> <p> Freeman also studies how the violence of the game ravages the bodies of players only too willing to suit up and endure extraordinary pain every Sunday, damn the consequences. There is also the matter of how teams are only too willing to look the other way if a player's off-the-field violence doesn't affect his on-the-field performance. </p> <p> <i>Bloody Sundays</i> takes us into the owners' offices to look at the worst franchise in football, how teams spy on their players, and how intelligence tests determine whether or not a player will be drafted. </p> <p> Part tribute, part expos&#233;, <i>Bloody Sundays</i> is a vivid portrait of professional football, the men who strap on their helmets every Sunday, and the men who lead them. </p></span>

                    <span>Now that ESPN has bowed to the pressure of the NFL and cancelled the show "Playmakers," it's left to Freeman's book to look inside the NFL and show it warts and all. A lot of attention has been given to the author's chapters on 'Steven Thompson' the pseudonym for a closeted gay football player. That chapter simply confirms what everyone already knows - that gay men are in football but they are not out nor are they likely to come out in the near future. The rest of the time Freeman draws upon his contacts and years as a reporter to analyze the people he spotlights both in an historical sense, as well as through direct access to the people and those around them. He paints pictures of people who may get the shaft in their professional lives, but who came to the game and keep going despite hardships because they truly love football. You can debate his picks for the best of all time in various positions, but you have to give Freeman the slack to express his opinions after spending time reporting on his topic, and he tries to reason out his choices. The person who does not know the NFL won't really be served by using this as an introduction, but readers familiar with the game and the players (not necessarily fanatics) will find the peek behind closed doors interesting.</span>

                    <span>This is one of those books that gives you a "wow" feeling afterward, you can hardly believe what you just read. The author knows a lot of people and goes behind the scenes and undercover, he shows how the teams actually spy on their players! And how a player is actually drafted.<P>It's tough reading because you see how mean and unforgiving the game and the team is to a player. You see how ruthless a game football can be. You respect the football players a lot more, because you see how much pain they always have to suffer in their job, and how much they damage their bodies. The author talks a lot about history and individual stories here, which makes his book familiar and very interesting.</span>
