                    <span>So you think you know the definition of a player, well I think you will change your mind once you read this novel written by Carl Weber.  He takes us further into the lives of the Duncans, the family we grew to love from his previous novel, Married Men.
<br />The Duncans are a unique family complete with sibling rivalry, heartbreaks, and family secrets.  The siblings are Will, Melanie, and the biggest playa of them all, Trent Duncan.
<br />
<br />Trent finds out that one of his exes claims that he is the father of the child.  But the child didn't look like him when he was born, plus his ex had been getting her a little sumptin sumptin on the side.
<br />
<br />Watch how this smooth operator lures the women in and makes them feel real special.  But the biggest thrill is to watch this player in action.  Remember the movie, How to be A Player starring Bill Bellamy, well, Bill would be a trainee under Trent.
<br />
<br />Go  ahead read the book, I guarantee you will finish it in one day. I know this reader did.  If you ain't scared, I dare you to pick it up, playa'.

                    <span>Carl Weber showed out! He really knows how to dramatize a story. I read this book in 2 days. I don't want to give the book away because this is the kind of book you don't want to know about so you can enjoy all of the surprises. Everything about the story was good. It is kind of about trouble in the lives of Wil, Trent, and Melanie who are all related. Its just drama, like in Baby Momma Drama. Carl has a hell of a mind. I love his writing style. Read it for yourself. You definitely won't be disappointed.

                    <span>I finished this book in Two Days!  I loved it.  Carl did his thang!  My favorite person of the book was Trent.  I knew that he was a bad guy, but he was smooth as hell.  And the end threw me for a loop, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it.  Wil, was wrong to tell his new co-worker anything about his home front.  That is how mess gets started in the first place.  Mel, she was cool, but a little slow.  You never tell all your business to your best friend about a man that you are so head over hills for until you know you have a solid relationship with.  Cause Dez wasn't Sh*t!.  I loved the drama and Can't wait til the next.  Thank you for doing You!</span>
