                <span id="Label1">Yesterday I finally got a few hours to catch up on some reading. At the top of my list was Pragmatic Project Automation by Mike Clark. It's the third installment in the Pragmatic Starter Kit series by the good folks at Pragmatic Programmer (Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas's original book is one of my all-time favorite books).
<br><br>I received a review copy to read because Ted Neward sat in on my talk on unit testing of ASP.NET applications at WinDev this year. At some point during the talk, I started ranting about the angle bracket tax that you have to pay when you write [N]Ant scripts. Ted came up to me after the talk and said that I just had to read Mike's book because he said exactly the same thing. So Ted kindly brokered a review copy for me via Dave Thomas.
<br><br>There's lots to love about this book. It's short - 150 pages, and I read it in a single sitting. On p.38, I read what I had initially came for - a guest discussion by James Duncan Davidson (the original creator of Ant) on his regrets for choosing XML as the input to Ant. Mike then goes on to talk about using Groovy, a dynamically typed Java-esque language for the JVM and how to use it to script Ant builds. 
<br><br>The syntax is much cleaner than the equivalent Ant script, but somewhat short of a domain-specific language. That said, the trade-off of less DSL is more than worth it since you have the entire power of the Java libraries at your disposal in your build scripts.
<br><br>The rest of the book is excellent. Mike has a real knack for writing - the ideas are crisp, and there's no superfluous words (trust me- there's a LOT of good ideas in this 150 page book). There are some very good pieces of advice regarding how to:
<br><br>* cut releases from your source tree, 
* how to automate builds using CruiseControl. 
* how to generate distributions using NSIS and their "SuperPIMP" technology (one of my favorite tools and technology names), 
* how to automate software feedback (similar to Steve Loughran's "happy" pages in his excellent Java Development with Ant book). 
* how to use Lava lamps to light up your dev team's experience 
<br><br>This book is written for a Java audience. However, good ideas are universal and transcend the technologies used to implement them. Most, if not all of the tools mentioned in Mike's book have equivalents in .NET.
<br><br>I highly recommend this book for any dev team. By automating your build process, you can spend more of your time working on important stuff, like seeing your families :)</span>

                    <span>This book will save you from hours of work and from many headaches. Mike Clark's "Pragmatic Project Automation" will show you how to automate any aspect of your project that you find repetitive. 
<br />
<br />Clark starts by describing how to automate a build script using Ant. There are entire books on this subject but "Pragmatic Project Automation" does a great job of distilling the essentials of what you need to know to get started (and for most projects in total). Once you have an automated build, the next step is having it run automatically. Clark describes how to do this with Cruise Control, a tool that will build a system whenever new code gets checked in. 
<br />
<br />This book goes well beyond just automated builds, however. We next learn how to automate releases, including generating all necessary distribution files. Next up are how to automate the installation and deployment processes. Finally we learn how to monitor both our build process and our deployed applications. The book even goes so far as to tell us how to monitor the build process with a pair of lava lamps.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone working with Java applications of any size.</span>

                    <span>Project Automation is an investment in the project infrastructure. This investment will pay huge dividends. Few developers want to spend their time fussing over a build or creating the new release, but it has to be done. This book shows how to get it done without sacrificing a developer to the process. At first, I was a little skeptical as to how much automation could be accomplished, but now I am sold. The time and aggravation saved are tangible dividends to this investment.
<br />
<br />With anecdotes, coding examples, and a sharp wit, the author progresses from touting the value of project automation to showing how to do it. He starts the process of convincing the reader that automation is a good thing with an amusing story to illustrate the need and the potential. Using readily available tools like Ant and CruiseControl, the author carefully explains each step. While there is sufficient coverage on the use of the tools for the examples, reference documentation will be necessary to "roll your own".
<br />
<br />On our last big project, I now realize that frequent automated builds would have saved a lot of time, which was in short supply. Because they became so painful we did them less frequently, rather we should have increased the frequency. I would consider this book an essential part of a technical lead's toolkit. Once the team can experience the benefits of continuous integration and project automation, they probably would not want to go back.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book. There is not much to lurn, as experienced Java developpers already know the road to continuous integration.
<br />This book is primarily useful to convince your coworkers and managers that a good development process is key to the success of a quality software development.
<br />The wireless Java lamp turning red when the build process failed is a bit far fetched, but most of the ideas are excellent.
<br />
<br />For a novice to intermediate "build master", this book is a must have.

                    <span>"Pragmatic Project Automation" is all about how to automate the tasks
<br />associated with building, testing, and deploying your application.  The
<br />assumption is that your project is a Java project, and all the tools
<br />are based around that.  Most of the automation is done with Ant, an
<br />automation tool written in Java and primarily used for building Java
<br />projects.  Since I do most of my work in java and ant, this is right 
<br />down my alley.
<br />
<br />"Pragmatic Project Automation" is one of the "Pragmatic Starter Kit"
<br />series of books.  The words "Starter Kit" should be taken seriously. 
<br />If you are acting as build master for your first project, this is a
<br />great book.  It will have you up and running your one-step builds in no
<br />time.  It provides numerous "best practices" for running automatic
<br />builds, unit tests, and deployment.  Unlike the original "Pragmatic
<br />Programmer," which was a collection of generally good ideas and
<br />practices to follow, the Pragmatic Starter Kits are specific recipes to
<br />follow for good results.
<br />
<br />The book assumes that you are using Java; the ideas behind the
<br />practices are universal and can be applied to any kind of project, but
<br />the specific advice is for Java only.  The specific tools recommended
<br />by the book are Ant for scripting, CVS for version control, and Cruise
<br />Control for scheduling.  Obviously, other tools can be used instead,
<br />but the recipes in the book will no longer work.  The ideas remain valid, however.
<br />
<br />I wish this book had been around 5 years ago when I first started
<br />building Java projects.  As it is, I had to learn much of this by trial
<br />and error.  Most of it is just simple, good sense, like having all your
<br />source in version control and having a script to check out your code
<br />and build the finished application.  But like all good sense, it is not
<br />as obvious and wide spread as it should be.  Every project I've been on
<br />could have used a good dose of pragmatic project automation.
<br />
<br />Though most of the book was already familiar to me, I did learn several
<br />things. One of the great ideas was to make build failures publically obvious through the use of lava lamps! If the build, or build tests, failed, the suggestion is to turn on a red lava lamp which is in a publically visible location.  Ant does not actually have a lava lamp task, so they cleverly provide instructions on automating the lava lamp with the use of an X10 lamp module.  When the build succeeds again, turn off the red lamp and turn on a green one.  I haven't yet implemented this, but I'd like to.
<br />
<br />Using ant for builds and CVS for version control is pretty standard,
<br />nowadays.  I think most projects do this or something equivalent (though
<br />the statistics on this show that statement to be hopelessly
<br />optimistic). This book does move on to a more advanced, and less
<br />standard tool.  They recommend performing builds automatically whenever
<br />code is checked in, and their tool of choice is Cruise Control.
<br />
<br />They provide nice recipes for setting up and running Cruise Control. 
<br />In my job, inspired by the book, we decided to try it and found it
<br />quite simple to set up and use.  It requires a little more
<br />infrastructure than, say, CVS in that it runs inside a java container
<br />like Tomcat, but if you are a Java shop you probably already know how
<br />to manage Tomcat.  If you don't, maybe it is time to learn.
<br />
<br />If you are a new build master on a Java project, read this book
<br />immediately.  Even if you've been doing it for a while, you probably
<br />won't be wasting your time if you read it.  The book is well written
<br />and accurate.  It has a nice style that moves along nicely.  At 176
<br />pages it is not a very long read, a welcome change in computer books. 
<br />The author tells you what he has to say, then shuts up--there's no
<br />padding here.
<br />
<br />All in all, a good book.  I'm glad I read it.  I wish I'd read it 5
<br />years ago.

                    <span>This book is a worthy successor to the previous two Pragmatic Starter Kit books.  You've got unit testing down.  You've got version control processes.  But, you're a programmer who is manually slaving over all of these processes not to mention system monitoring, builds, and deployments.
<br />
<br />Pragmatic Project Automation gives a wonderful, step by step recipe for automating all of the time-consuming, error-proned activities of a (Java) project.  It also instructs and motivates the reader to think in this way, so that future opportunities for automation don't go unrecognized.
<br />
<br />This one is a "must have".</span>
