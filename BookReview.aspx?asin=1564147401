                    <span>I have almost finished reading this book and I think the author really knows what he's talking about.  The only drawback I have is that I am in the Healthcare Industry.  The author refers a lot to the Business/ Marketing/ etc. Industry.  However, even though I would have liked a book that was more in line with my career...this is a really good book.  I feel much more confident about finding a job since reading this book.  He starts at the beginning with knowing who you are...to the end of geting the interview and landing the job you want.  </span>

                    <span>During my job search, I did all the common job search strategies, like posting my resume on job search boards, submitting my resume in response to the classified ads in the newspaper and asking your parents for a job within the company. Times have changed and you need to adapt to the changing job market. 
<br />
<br />I would highly recommend "10 Insider Secrets to a Winning Job Search" to anyone searching for a job. This book is easy reading and outlines proven strategies to successfully land a job in any job market you are up against. 
<br />
<br />This book is a must have and will be beneficial in your job search. As a testimony, this book has been proven to be very resourceful and beneficial in landing my current job. 
<br />
<br />Thank you Todd.</span>

                    <span>Recently, I re-entered the workforce after four years of being in my own business. What I initially encountered when sending out resumes and interviewing was extremely frustrating. I thought I had great credentials and tremendous quantifiable accomplishments. What I discovered very fast was that many companies didn't care because I was either too old to be considered or my rolodex wasn't good enough.
<br />
<br />Then, I read both "10 Insider Secrets to a Winning Job Search" by Todd Bermont and also went through Todd's two-hour paperback workshop "10 Insider Secrets Career Transition Workshop." After completing both books, I discovered that I was interviewing for jobs that I wasn't truly passionate about. I realized that my lack of enthusiasm was translating into job-hunting frustration and failure. 
<br />
<br />After reading both books, I decided to go into a totally new industry where I had absolutely no experience. Oddly enough, I got four job offers in less than a month after reading both books and redirecting my efforts. Now I am working for a company that totally fit my criteria for the ideal company and I found a job that still allowed me to foster my entreprenerial spirit. I can't say enough positive things about these two books. If you are frustrated in your job search you need to read both "10 Insider Secrets" books.</span>

                    <span>This guide to job hunting may provide a practical boost if you're looking for a job. It recaps some of the most widely known and broadly discussed tips about job seeking, and presents them clearly and concisely. Though it has little that is brand new, it does put some things in a different, positive light. Author Todd Bermont backs up his book with a website and provides details about his 10 recommendations. While they may not really be secrets, they amount to an organized 10-step path to finding a new and better job. Bermont is chatty, and uses conversational (as opposed to textbook) grammar, as he boosts your self-confidence and assures you that the perfect job is out there, if you search for it the right way. His first three steps urge you to deal with your own assets and wishes before you begin to contact prospective employers. However, once you are ready for that step, he makes sure you know how to proceed with the right resume, contact strategy and interview technique. We recommend this book to those who are searching for entry level or mid-level jobs. It may not be quite sophisticated enough to open doors into the executive suite, but when you're out of work your job becomes finding a job - and this book will help.</span>
