                    <span>This collection of short stories written during the 1950's and 1960's before the author was well known is easily worth reading.  Kurt Vonnegut delves into human nature, prejudice, oppression, hypocrisy, militarism and greed in this varied collection.  One story introduces us to the first super weapon with a conscience.  Another involves a chess game where the expendable pieces are live humans.  "The Foster Portfolio" is a mystery about why a man would choose working poverty over wealth. "The Long Walk to Forever" shows young adults that almost accidentally discover the depths of their feelings for each other.  There is also politics, hypocrisy, and of course, science fiction.   Many of the stories are excellent; while a few don't measure up.  Overall, however, this is a first-rate collection from a great writer.

                    <span>This was the first book I ever read by Vonnegut, and it was good enough to spur me on to furthur reading. This is a collection of some of his shorter stories, and I think it gives the reader a fairly good idea of his writing style. 
<br />
<br />I think whoever compiled these stories chose a bad one to start off with. Where I Live, while well written and very descriptive, was very boring. I was ready to stop reading after this one. I slogged through to the next, and discovered I had read Harrison Bergeron in high school. This is a great story about PC-ness gone crazy. So then I was drawn into this book and the wonderful stories that followed. 
<br />
<br />Although I could go one by one and review each story, I really think that would amount to an extremely long review. Suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed almost every stroy in this book. Vonnegut's writings are descriptive and vast, and his obviously unique and odd viewpoints make for extremely interesting and thought-provoking reading. This man was very much ahead of the times when these stories were written. 
<br />
<br />The stories are very unique in and of themselves also. Just when you think you have Vonnegut pegged, he throws you a curve and a totally different type of storyline, and you wonder what in the world goes on in this guy's mind. Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Vonnegut, but very much on my mind since I purchased it off Amazon is "The Losers' Club" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.

                    <span>I just read this book last year, as a tenth grader.  It might sound as though I'm exaggerating if I say it changed my life, but I believe that almost everything you read changes you in a small way.  Well, this book changed me in a big way.  I'll still be thinking about these stories months after I read them.  They're the kind of stories that make you want to close your eyes and think for an hour after you're done reading them.  This book was my introduction to Kurt Vonnegut, and it remains my favorite.  
<br />
<br />I also think its amazing how a book read by somebody 30 years ago can still have the same effect on a young person today, and I hope that 30 years from now, this book will still change people.</span>

                    <span>I was once told that the true writer can write short fiction as well as lengthier works.  If that is true then Vonnegut is a true master.  "Welcome to the Monkey House" is a true masterpiece.  The short stroies are a study of our society.  The story that is the name of the book shows how a society can go wrong with the idea of doing good.  The hero is a rapist who lives in a society that actually encourages suicide.  The women who work at these suicide centers have sex with their clients before they die, but the women cannot feel anything below their waist so they cannot enjoy sex due to "medicine" they take.  The "hero" lets the drug wear off then rapes the women so they can feel for the first time sexual pleasure.  The study is the rapes of women by one man as compared to the societal rape by making women not be able to feel pleasure. Tough stuff.  The story ends with the explanation of how the idea of anesthetizing the pleasurable feel of sex started, which is the name of the story. 
<br />
<br />Harrison Bergeron is every bit as scary because it is what happens when the law makes everybody equal.  There is always someone that has to run the show and they can't be equal.  "All of the Kings Men" is about a game of chess where captured soldiers are the actual pieces and their leader has to make tough choices.
<br />
<br />Not all of the stories are so depressing.  "Who will I be Tommorrow" is about a couple who fall in love by never being themselves.  It is fun and light although it does explore the deeper meaning of relationships.
<br />
<br />"Welcome to the Monkey House" is a masterpiece and should not be missed.  It is a thinking man's book, but at the same time so well written that is it is truly enjoyable as it is on it's own.  Highly reccommended.</span>
