                <span id="Label1">No one can accuse director Bruno Dumont of taking the easy road. Dumont's <I>Life of Jesus</I> and <I>L'Humanite</I> are fascinating, but they test the comfort zone of even the most devoted art-house maven. <I>Twentynine Palms</I> serves up more of Dumont's uncompromising rigor, this time set in America. A couple scout locations in the desert around Joshua Tree, and spend most of their time fighting or having sex. The frankness of the director's approach to sex does not prepare one for the shock of the truly bleak final reels. This <I>Last Tango</I> in <I>Zabrieskie Point</I> has a lulling, creepy power before it reaches those shocks, although actors David Wissak and Katia Golubeva are perhaps not as compelling as Dumont wants them to be. Of course, he's showing empty people traversing one of the emptiest places on earth--so maybe it fits. In any case, this film will shake you if you stick with it. <I>--Robert Horton</I></span>

                    <span>The story is basically to see how the man vould understand the woman's desire to certain extent but the story turns into a murder (with knife) towards the woman whom is tagging the man all along. This is a french likke film which is recorded in English and it contains four sexual content altogether with a kill. A recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film. Enjoy.....

<br />
<br />**Major Spoilers**
<br />
<br />Twenty Nine Palms was a hard one to watch. First it bored us to death with long, untrimmed scenes, seemingly about not too much.
<br />
<br />But I didn't think a film that had indulged itself as much as this one would fail to provide a decent payoff at the end.
<br />
<br />Well, the film paid off all right.
<br />
<br />A lot of what seems to be aimless ballast in the film turns out to have informed the shocking ending.
<br />
<br />This guy who looks and acts like Travis Bickel in Taxi Driver, has a lust for sex even Travis, despite his pent up violence, does not display.
<br />
<br />Not that the girl wasn't mostly game, though she complained about the underwater sex act in the motel swimming pool. She said her boyfriend "hurt" her.
<br />
<br />A group of marines jump into the pool. 'Travis' then asks Katie if he would still be acceptable if he shaved his head like the raucous marines. She said he would NOT be acceptable, but the marines were "very handsome." This is a very ambivalent response to a pretty jealous boyfriend. The hair theme is pronounced in the film. It is a manlihood issue for 'Travis.' At one point Katie asks Jim what he uses on his hair. He doesn't answer.
<br />
<br />The Marine discussion is one in a long series of actions, sex play and significant dialog between the couple that inform the violent end of the film.
<br />
<br />'Travis' is ambivalent and a little jealous of those marines that broke up the tryst in the pool. Both the raucous marines and the jealousy theme echo in the rape scene near the end and the devastating Tsunami-like backlash later in the motel room.
<br />
<br />There's a theme of isolation in the desert and in the two lovers' almost total separation from everyone as they wander from motel to desert and back again. The most extreme example of it is when the french-speaking Katy leaves the motel after an argument with 'Travis,' but then is so terrified at just the approach of a car on the street, that she finds herself forced to return to her lover's 'custody.' Figure it out, though. This woman does not speak English, while he does, and would not be able to explain herself to desert denizens and Los Angelenos. She has to go back to him and probably isn't that happy about returning.
<br />
<br />At one point, the couple watches a father confess he had sex with their daughter to his wife on Jerry Springer. All along, Jim-'Travis' has been showing signs of abject soulessness in discussions with Katie. "I feel sorry for her,"says Katie. "For Who," asks Jim? "The Mother," replies Katie. Then Katie asks Jim, "would you do anything like that? "Are you crazy," replies Jim, unconvincingly. Katie looks at Jim to try to divine whether he is lying. In the right circumstance Jim would have sex with his daughter. Jim turns and smiles. The move convinces Katie it is safe to leave Jim alone with her daughter should she ever have one.
<br />
<br />The storyteller is showing us that these two have opted away from civilized ways. In a way, they DESERVE what happens to them for wandering outside the boundaries of civilization. The uncivilized sexual play of the two in deserted and lonely places is still another indication that these two are asking for it. Indeed, their behavior contains the seeds of their destruction.
<br />
<br />Finally, there is a need to explain the final scene of a dead naked body in the desert while a lone policeman does a 360 around body and Hummer. There were two scenes in the hotel room, one of Travis stabbing Katie in a manner that mirrors physically what had happened to him in the desert. It should be noted that he has shaved his head in the way that Bickel did in Taxi Driver, a way that Katie has said she would not approve of on him, but WOULD APPROVE OF on the Marines in the pool. See the link between the thugs in the desert and the marines in the pool on the one hand, and the ironic sheering of Jim's own locks in the bathroom before his act of rage against Katie and the World. Jim is re-enacting exactly what happened to him in the desert, coiffed like the skinhead who raped him and the marines who made him jealous.
<br />
<br />There's the scene of Jim poised over Katie's lifeless corpse on the bed, then one of the corpse alone on the bed.
<br />
<br />So what is Jim doing out in the desert in the last scene? I think it is possible he went out looking for the guys in the white truck and found them. They then stripped him naked again and this time finished the job. A bigger likelihood is that Jim abandoned Katie's body in the motel, drove out to the exact place where he had been raped, and, partly in remorse and despair, partly out of hopelessness, cut his own throat with the same dull knife he first cut his hair with, and then offed Katie.
<br />
<br />This might be somewhat hard for some to admit. I'll bet I wasn't the only male who laughed at the irony when the skinhead pulled Jim's pants below his bare rear end and had a go at him.

                    <span>Others have already described the movie; so I shall not repeat what has already said.
<br />Dumont makes a movie, somewhat reminiscent of the late 60s early 70s "road" movies, in which a couple, gets in a car and drives off, to nowhere in particular. I hated those movies, but at least, in those movies the emotions the characters exhibited had some kind of rationale to it. Here the emotions are totally disconnected from reality, have nothing to do with what is going on in the screen, and seem only to be there to move the plot, if there is one, along.
<br />Katia, the girl, who seems quite psycotic if you ask me, keeps getting angry for no reason whatsoever; for instance, she entices pair of dogs to follow their moving car, then gets p#$sed at her boyfriend, when he hits one of them. By the time the movie approaches its dismal end, I did not care anymore how the director was going to wrap it up. 
<br />The DVD includes a "Director's note of intent" (always a bad sign) A mix of Felliniesque dialog, blended with Sun Tzu; not a good combination. At the end of the "note of intent" the director finishes with "Envisage this film only in relation to the means employed and so only work from instinct"
<br />Well, instinct will not get you a viewable movie; I don't think you could make a worse movie, if you were trying to achieve it. It is not the violence or sex, other movies have that but still have some redeeming values, photography, artistic creation. There is no redeeming value in this. Just a waste of the DVD plastic.

                    <span>Most of our comments regarding the free ice cream, the laughable sex scenes and the dog incident have already been raised by the sensible viewers of this big waste of time.  In regards to the scene with the passengers of the white truck, we thought of them as dog owners seeking vengeance.  It's a shame they didn't take their anger out on the dope who was calling the dogs to run alongside the vehicle as well.

                    <span>The beauty of the film "Twentynine Palms" is that you can place any theory you want on it, and the theory will work. It's possible to argue that the film is about the apocalyptic nature of male-female relationships. There are a couple of clues that stretch the theory that the film is anti-marine. I could just as easily argue that this is an anti-Hummer film. This latter theory is my personal favorite, and I'm sticking with it. 
<br />
<br />David (David Wissak), a photographer is on a road trip with Katia (Yekaterina Golubeva), his French-speaking girlfriend. He is supposed to be driving out in the middle of nowhere to look for locations for a shoot. As they drive through the barren Southern Californian desert, they stop at a handful of motels where they argue--usually over quite petty things. They also engage in increasingly noisy and violent hanky-panky. When I first noted the bruises on Katia's knees, I thought I'd imagined them, but the number and location of bruises increased as the film continued. 
<br />
<br />I will admit that I was a little intrigued by the film, and this kept me watching and also results in a two star rating. I wondered if David was luring Katia out to the desert for some sort of snuff film. After all, I reasoned, a photographer would surely be snapping away at the spectacular landscape. But David (with NO camera) seems more concerned with the scratch marks on his Hummer than the vistas just outside his windshield. The arguments between this ill-matched sour pair become increasingly stupider, more violent and unexplainable, and as the film progressed, I created alternate theories about what was 'really' going on in the film. I just didn't buy the photographer story.
<br />
<br />But all my theories went down the toilet with the film's violent, senseless, brutal and abrupt conclusion. The problem with a film that has such a pointless ending is that it faces the possibility that the entire film becomes pointless as a result, and this is exactly what happened with "Twentynine Palms". It is a pointless film. "Twentynine Palms" (not to be confused with "29 Palms") is mainly in French with English subtitles--displacedhuman</span>
