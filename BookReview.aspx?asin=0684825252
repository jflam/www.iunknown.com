                <span id="Label1">In his bestselling <I>The End of History and the Last Man,</I> Francis Fukuyama argued that the end of the Cold War would also mean the beginning of a struggle for position in the rapidly emerging order of 21st-century capitalism. In <I>Trust,</I> a penetrating assessment of the emerging global economic order "after History," he explains the social principles of economic life and tells us what we need to know to win the coming struggle for world dominance. <P> Challenging orthodoxies of both the left and right, Fukuyama examines a wide range of national cultures in order to divine the underlying principles that foster social and economic prosperity. Insisting that we cannot divorce economic life from cultural life, he contends that in an era when social capital may be as important as physical capital, only those societies with a high degree of social trust will be able to create the flexible, large-scale business organizations that are needed to compete in the new global economy. <P> A brilliant study of the interconnectedness of economic life with cultural life, <I>Trust</I> is also an essential antidote to the increasing drift of American culture into extreme forms of individualism, which, if unchecked, will have dire consequences for the nation's economic health.</span>

                    <span>Fukuyama trots out stereotypes that he must have picked up at his Japanese-Protestant father's knee, under a thick veneer of impenetrable sociological jargon that can fool the occasional reader into believing that this is an impartial scientist at work. Like all stereotypes, Fukuyama's are a blend of breathtaking overgeneralizations, and huge blind spots. And, like all stereotypes, they are utter nonsense.
<br />
<br />The book attempts to update Max Weber's "Protestant ethic" story to include some non-Christian societies. The basic argument of the book is that Catholics are unable to trust people outside their immediate family, and so unable to form associations that are not based on family ties. The same is true of the Chinese, claims Fukuyama. These are the Catholics of the Orient. 
<br />
<br />The Japanese and Protestants are able to transcend family ties and therefore form a vast range of associations that do not have a genetic basis, especially large professionally managed corporations. 
<br />
<br />The feckless Catholics and Chinese however are doomed to form business enterprises that can never be more than over-grown Mom and Pop operations. Fukuyama therefore has a gloomy prognosis for the economic miracles of China or Taiwan or Singapore--however brilliant a businessman Pop may be, sooner or later descendants like Paris Hilton will be running the show.
<br />
<br />There is an interesting chapter on Korea, where Fukuyama is at pains to show that however like wannabe Japanese/Protestants Korean business organizations may seem, they are really Chinese/Catholic at heart.
<br />
<br />The book's thesis is obvious nonsense. Dramatic counter-examples exist, such as the Chinese Communist Party or the Jesuits. Also, the broad idea that Catholicism contributes to poverty lacks a statistical basis. 
<br />
<br />It is certainly true that the average Catholic is poorer than the average Protestant. But this is simply a statistical correlation between two well-known facts: (a) there are a lot more Catholics than Protestants, and (b) there are a lot more poor people than rich people. If one follows a matched-pair approach, comparing say the Netherlands to Belgium, or Lithuania to Latvia, or Bavaria to Brandenburg, or West Virginia to Rhode Island, ... the evils of Catholicism are far less apparent.</span>

                    <span>I live in Europe close to the fault line between (in Fukuyama-speak) low-trust-land and high-trust-land and I have rarely read such an interesting book. In some ways the book is the successor to Max Weber's magnum opus, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (published in 1905) about the impact of protestant religion and culture on economical success in Germany. 
<br />
<br />Rather than compare Protestantism with Catholicism and their economical impact on German citizens, Fukuyama divides the world into high and low trust societies. Within Europe low trust societies largely coincide with Catholic countries and high trust societies coincide largely with Protestant countries, hence some of Fukuyama's work will sound familiar at times to a reader of Max Weber. Still, Fukuyama's categorisation is not based per se on religious affiliation. Fukuyama is at pains to attribute the low trust of Italians or French to historical events or situations. At times it seems he goes out of his way to avoid attributing any causal role to religion. But the advantage of his approach is that his methodology in theory works in any culture outside the European Christian context. Fukuyama also applies his trust criterion on societies such as the US, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. The Middle East and Africa are conspicuous in their absence, possibly because there are few if any examples of so-called high-trust cultures in these parts of the world.
<br />
<br />There are a few shortcomings to the book :
<br />
<br />Fukuyama only draws economical consequences from the presence or absence of trust, for instance, he claims high trust cultures such as Japan and Germany find it easier to form very large companies, whilst low trust cultures such as Taiwan or Italy feel more at home in family companies. It is a pity he does not extend the field of study of consequences into areas such as corruption (low trust countries generally score higher on corruption), the law (for instance perjury is not regarded as a big deal in low trust countries), demographics (intermarriage, such as consanguineous marriages, is much more common in low trust cultures such as in the Middle East), etc...
<br />
<br />The division of the world by Fukuyama into low and high trust cultures is very binary. Some studies by others into trust have first segmented the environment of individuals in concentric layers, starting with the immediate family, then friends, then the extended family, then the local community, then the country and then his or her civilisation. In such a scenario trust typically decreases with each layer which is further removed from the individual (although there are exceptions, such as in failed Islamic states where more trust is put by individuals in the Umma - all Muslims - than in the nation.), but the slope of the curve differs between low and high trust cultures. Still, as a simplification, the division into two extremes of trust is an interesting start.
<br />
<br />Like all human phenomena, economic organisation can never be explained by one variable. But even if trust turns out to be only one of the variables which have a high correlation with economic structure, it remains a valid subject for a book like this.
<br />
<br />Finally, some reviewers have accused Fukuyama of explicitly arguing that economic development is hampered by low trust, whilst I think he actually argues economic structures are merely different in both categories. Nobody will argue Belgium, a typical low-trust culture, is poorer in GDP per capita terms than - say - the neighboring Netherlands, a typical high trust culture that even shares its language with the majority of Belgians. But it is true that Belgian multinational companies are even rarer than famous Belgians.
<br />
<br />Despite the simplifications this is still a very interesting book for those interested in the compatibilities or incompatibilities of cultures in the workplace. One of Fukuyama's underrated books.</span>

                    <span>Summary:<p>The author claims in his chapter, Friction-Free Economies, that it is necessary to turn to a cultural characteristic like spontaneous sociability to explain the existence of large-scale corporations in an economy, or prosperity more generally. The question of spontaneous sociability is particularly important because we cannot take the older ethical habits for granted. A rich and complex civil society does not arise inevitably out of the logic of the advance of industrialization. On the contrary, Japan, Germany, and the United States became the world¡¯s leading industrial leaders in large part because they had healthy endowments of social capital and spontaneous sociability, and not vice versa. Also, the author emphasizes on the economic function of trust and spontaneous sociability. If we presume that if legal institutions exist, the presence of a high degree of trust as an additional condition of economic relations can increase economic efficiency by reducing what economists call transaction costs, incurred by activities like finding the appropriate buyer or seller, negotiating a contract, complying with government regulations and enforcing contracts. <p>In conclusion, traditional sociability can be said to be loyalty to older, long-established social groups. By contrast, spontaneous sociability is the ability to come together and cohere in new groups, and to thrive in innovative organizational settings. Spontaneous sociability is likely to be helpful from an economic standpoint only if it is used to build wealth-creating economic organization. Traditional sociability, on the other hand, can frequently be an obstacle to growth. <p>Critique 1:<p> In the article, the writer talks about the free rider problem. It is said that when a country which has communal solidarity, people will get resources without contributing to society as much as others. The solution, suggested by the writer, is to designate the work in unit base. And, the writer cited a successful example of Mao¡¯s policy, a famous Chinese leader, towards peasants. However, nowadays, it seems that it is more difficult to prevent such problems as the relationship between people become more and more indispensable. It is difficult to delimit the job by unit clearly as what was done in agricultural society in the past. <p>Moreover, there is no perfect government policy in the world as it is impossible to balance all the interests equally among people. For example, the free rider phenomenon is serious in some countries. In some cases in Hong Kong, the free riders are getting the government¡¯s subsidy without contributing to the society. Especially, during the economic depression, people are in hard time and the government tries to help them by providing subsidy to the public. However, in some cases, the subsidy fund for a family provided by the government is similar to the salary during an economic depression. Therefore, many people select not to work which can be said to be a kind of free rider. Even through it is known by the government, it is unpreventable. Therefore, nowadays, the free rider problem is not easy to combat with.<p>Critique 2: <p>In this article, author mentions about the economic function of trust and spontaneous sociability. It is right that a high degree of trust can increase economic efficiency and reduce transaction costs comparatively. But, in my point of view, it doesn¡¯t mean the companies can get great benefit and guarantee from the high degree of trust, their gains are very limited. In economic activities, we should take a minimal level of trust and honesty for every economic partner, even the companies which have good relation and cooperative experience with us. Business is business. When you choose high trust in appearance, actually, you are also taking high risk in disappearance stealthily. Because all the economic activities only focus on one goal-benefits. <p>As the author mentions, societies manifesting a high degree of communal solidarity and shared moral value should be more economically efficient than their more individualistic counterparts. This is due to the ¡°free riders¡± problem. This kind of problems cannot be avoided. The greater organizations become, the greater the tendency of ¡°free rider¡± is. Why it happens? One reason is those organizations¡¯ benefits or efforts are most influence or control, and in the organizations, his or her individual benefits or efforts are ignored. We can see, in a small group, because the group members are highly dependent on one another, and, also when a single partner slack off, which will be noticed immediately by colleagues. So, I think, it needs kinds of high degree of trust and solidarity in a group. Moreover, it would be helpful to put the organization and an individual interest together, create member¡¯s self-motive, and enact proper roles are also good methods to limit free rider in the group.</span>

                    <span>This book argues that economic development is 80% good economics and 20% good culture.  This is not a new concept, as many other authors, such as Lawrence Harrison, have grappled with the issue of culture in economic development.  <p>Fukuyama slices culture and focuses particularly on the issue of trust, as the bond that reduces transactions costs.  The literature on transactions costs is also vast, initiated by Coase in the 1930s.  <p>The main contribution of this book is to establish an empirical link between trust and the reduction of transactions costs which consequently account for a more friction-less economy.  However, as a non-economist, Fukuyama writes to the international relations and political science professional, as a respected scholar mainly in these circles.  As such, he does a good job of bringing somewhat theoretical economic concepts to the forefront of policy makers.</span>

                    <span>In this challenging book, author Francis Fukuyama examines the role of "trust" in economics. He proposes that it is the social capital of a given country (or even area within a country) that defines how its economy functions. In a high-trust society, individuals have a propensity to join voluntary organizations, and as such there are likely to be many organizations (including business organizations), of all sizes. In a low-trust society, where individuals are only able to organize within their own clan or family, organizations are likely to be either small, or very large (and state-operated). Along the way, he examines countries around the globe, but focusing primarily on China and the Confusion countries, Italy, France and Korea (as low-trust societies), and Japan, Germany and the United States (as high-trust societies). <p>I found this book to be quite fascinating. I must admit that I am not an expert on economics, but I found the author's arguments quite convincing. His examination of various countries explained a lot of things that I have noticed before, but he succeeds in putting it all into a whole new paradigm. I highly enjoyed this though-provoking book, and recommend it to everyone!</span>
