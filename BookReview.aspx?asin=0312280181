                    <span>The premise for this WWII novel is excellent, however the execution is awful. This is just about the worst written historical novel I've ever read, and I've read a bunch. The story is based on a Marine Corps myth, which the author notes there is absolutely no record of, or any of the participants, in any USMC records. A number of readers seem to have totally missed this distinction, and think it really happened! Oh well... the story starts by establishing wartime Shanghai, the far eastern city of spies, where American soldiers mix with British administrators, exiled White Russians, and diplomats of all shades and stripes. When a warning of imminent war with Japan is sent out to all American forces in the weeks prior to Pearl Harbor, it becomes clear that the American units will need to retreat from China, which is largely under Japanese occupation. Although most of these troops are concentrated in various bases, there are a few isolated outposts. This is where Cpt. Billy Port, USMC comes in. <p>The younger son of a prominent and somewhat notorious Boston family, Port is highly regarded in the Marine Corps for his works with Gen. "Chesty" Puller in Central America. The first part of the book establishes the lush life of Shanghai and his comfortable living, including an "arrangement" with a beautiful young White Russian exile woman, and weekly tennis matches with an American-born, UCLA educated, Japanese officer. No points for guessing that the latter part of the book will pit friend against friend... When the warning of war comes, Port is tasked with traveling across China to gather up the far-flung American units, and lead them to safety. To do so, he handpicks a small unit and sets up a convoy of four trucks and his Bentley convertible for the mission.<p>The unit he assembles is part central casting, part improbable fancy. There's a Mexican sergeant who's gimmick is that he served with Pershing against Pancho Villa and talks about it incessently. Somehow this manages to be as equally irritating to the reader (because it's not funny), as it's meant to be to the other characters. There's "Sparky" the radio guy, the grease-monkey/mechanic, a big brave lummox carrying the heavy gun, a bunch of anonymous BAR grunts, a college-boy Naval reserve lieutenant, and (I'm not making this up!), his Chinese butler, a world-famous French race-car driver, and a White Russian alternately referred to as "General", "Count", and "Prince" Yusopov. Along the way, they pick up a female Chinese doctor, and a British Catholic priest/paleontologist. Now, an able writer (such as George MacDonald Fraser) could have had a lot of fun with this wild and wacky cast, but Brady just isn't up to it. These characters either seem to serve no discernable purpose (such as the Naval officer), or are very convenient devices (the Russian teaches the Marines how to make a Molotov cocktail and just happens to have a brother at a monastery where sanctuary is available at a critical time, the English priest just happens to know the whole country like the back of his hand and speaks the dialects, etc.).<p>The bulk of the book is one extended chase scene, as this motley band of brothers makes its way across the Chinese country, skirmishing with bandits, ducking Japanese Zeros, suffering in the elements, and ultimately, racing for the Soviet border. The action sequences are far and away the strongest parts, from ambushing a pursing patrol, to facing down huge bandit hordes, it's good stuff (if somewhat predictable). Alas, the bulk of the book is riddled with cliche, repetition (for example, the term "top sergeant" is explained several times), and awkwardness (for example, every time Port meets with his "staff", Brady feels compelled to run through the roll call of who is present). It's the kind of story that might work better as a film, where one is a little more forgiving of hokiness and the dialogue would be much tighter. In any event, Port's race across China is a promising idea for a story, but this book just doesn't deliver the goods.</span>

                    <span>I was disappointed in this book.  The story is of a detachment of Marines getting themselves and any other Marines they can get to join them out of China after war with Japan breaks out.  <p>Since there is nothing from the author about how much of this tale is true, I am assuming that much of it is fiction and thus the lower grade.  Along with the Marines come fortuitous stragglers including a paleontologist who seemingly knows every inch of Mongolia - as well as the language There is also a White Russian prince who aids and abets the detachment when they get to Russia as well as teaching the Marines the handy dandy Molotov cocktail when it happens to be the perfect weapon.<p>Thus the story seems contrived.  Additionally, the star of the book, Captain Port, does something in the end of the book that does not fit the Marine's personality at all and truly seemed contrived.<p>If I could believe more of this book were true, it would be much better in the truth stranger than fiction genre.  As pure fiction, however, I found it lacking.  There was some good background material about China and the times that made it more palatable and worth finishing.  For those who, like me, loved Guns of Autumn, this was a major letdown.</span>

                    <span>***WARNING - Nitpicking Plot points ***<p>Again James Brady gives us a great story about Marines in action against unbelievable odds. Again, his book will probably disappoint military history buffs due to bad editing.<p>Though I loved the story of Captain Port and his ad-hoc group struggling to get out of China, as a military history buff, I couldn't get past some of the glaring inaccuracies.<p>Marine Officers' swords have never been strong enough to behead a man with one chop.<p>Marine Infantry units didn't carry flamethrowers until well into 1943.<p>Even fanatical 1st Sergeants will set aside uniform regulations to take care of their Marines.<p>His intercepted radio reports talked about things happening in the weeks following Pearl Harbor that didn't really occur until well into 1942.<p>Am I nitpicking? Probably. But if you're going to write a piece of historical fiction, then its crucial to get the facts straight. Even though its a great story, it lacks credibility because of these holes. I enjoyed reading it except when these errors popped up.<p>Great story for people who want to root on the good guys. Not so good for military history buffs. Try reading the first novel in "The Corps" series by WEB Griffin instead.</span>

                    <span>There's a lot of Ken McCoy, if you're familiar with W.E.B. Griffin's "Semper Fi" series, in Captain Billy Port, U.S.M.C. They're are both 'China Marines,' underscoring the presence of an American Infantry force in China that in the summer and fall of 1941, had been in Asia since the turn of the 20th century. They both are encouraged by a strong sense of honor or fidelity, have expensive tastes, high intelligence, and have earned the respect of hard men. I am reminded of Orwell's comments that we who are bathed in the warmth of freedom, sleep well because there are 'hard men' who guard our gates. Billy Port, trapped behind enemy lines by the whims of the Japanese government having selected December 7 to bomb Pearl Harbor, doomed by his own sense of honor, recognizing that the only chance he has for himself and his men is to advance smartly in the opposite direction toward Russia, is one of those men.<br> <br>I thoroughly enjoyed the novel. It is a novel, we have to remember, although things like that surely happened. Perhaps there was a Billy Port. There certainly were White Russians, Jewish intellectuals, French dilettantes, beautiful courtesans, Mongolian bandits and the above mentioned Marines trying to get the heck out of Dodge when Pearl Harbor happened.<p>Brady, who himself is not unfamiliar with winter in that part of the world, having spent a cold year in the Marine Corps in Korea 9 years after the events described in Warning of War, does an above average job in making the reader 'feel the cold.'<p>You might want to pick up "The Coldest War," Brady's auto-biographical account of his year in the infantry in Korea in 1950-51.<p>Additionally, I believe the style of the infantry officer, his concern for men, his focus in times of battle, his remorse for losses, brief but heartfelt, is well reported. At one point Captain Port arises at 2 in the morning to walk the perimeter in 18 below zero weather. He stops and talks to the men on watch, saying a few words to each of them, spending a moment with them. He does that, he tells us, because 'that's what combat officers do. Let the men know that you're willing to spend time with them when it's damn cold.'<p>Despite the tale revolving around the character of this infantry officer, this is really a tale of an event. Billy Port is the central piece of the puzzle, but it's a well crafted story of an escape from the great shadow of war by an odd crew of individuals cast, inadvertantly, behind enemy lines. Definitely worth the read.</span>

                    <span>If as the author has said, that this is a true story, then we should Honor the men of this story. They are true heros.<br>If Hollywood doesn't make a movie out of this one, they are even worse then nuts! History is full of stories of unknown heros, and thier fights, I love these stories, Keep em comming!</span>
