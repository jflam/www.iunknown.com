                <span id="Label1"><P> Boy meets dot-com, boy falls for dot-com, boy flees dot-com in horror. So goes one of the most perversely hilarious love stories you will ever read, one that blends tech culture, hero worship, cat litter, Albanian economics, venture capitalism, and free bagels into a surreal cocktail of delusion. <P> In 1998, when Amazon.com went to temp agencies to recruit people, they gave them a simple directive: send us your freaks. Mike Daisey -- slacker, onetime aesthetics major, dilettante -- seemed perfect for the job. His ascension from lowly temp to customer service representative to business development hustler over the course of twenty-one dog years is the stuff of both dreams and nightmares. <P> With lunatic precision, Daisey describes the lightless cube farms in which book orders were scrawled on Post-its while technicians struggled to bring computers back online; the fourteen-hour days fueled by caffeine, fanaticism, and illicit day-trading from office desks made from doors; his strange compulsion to send free books to Norwegians; and the fevered insistence of BizDev higher-ups that the perfect business partner was Pets.com -- the now-extinct company that spent all its assets on a sock puppet. <P> In these pages, you'll meet Warren, the cowboy of customer service, capable of verbally hog-tying even the most abusive customer; Amazon employee #5, a reclusive computer gamer worth a cool $300 million, who spends at least six hours a day locked in his office killing goblins; and Jean-Michele, Mike's girlfriend and sparring partner, who tries to keep him grounded, even as dot-com mania seduces them both. At strategic intervals, the narrative is punctuated by hysterically honest letters to CEO Jeff Bezos -- missives that seem ripped from the collective unconscious of dot-com disciples the world over. <P> <I>21 Dog Years</I> is an epic story of greed, self-deception, and heartbreak, a wickedly funny anthem to an era of bounteous stock options and boundless insanity.</span>

                    <span>There is no significance in this book. Most of the people already know that there are sweatshops out there. It can be in the US soils or not. They make a product or support the operations. Many companies use these practices to make money quick. Also I can imagine most of the people understand that it is difficult to be a customer service representative. I really didn't need to be told these ten thousand times. This book didn't make me laugh it made me depressed. No wonder this book is so repetitive since there is not much for author to write on the subject that it is repetitive to start with</span>

                    <span>Daisey gives an insightful and hilarious account of the insanity that buoyed the Clinton economy!  While any account of this period of delirium where intelligent, well educated, and otherwise rational people bought into such extraordinary hype is always going to be entertaining, Daisey's metaphorical analysis and introspection had me laughing throughout most of the book.  As a post dot-bomb era employee at Amazon, Daisey delivers an extra plus in helping to explain some of the weirdness that exists at Amazon to this day.</span>

                    <span>I was close to putting down this book before I got to the middle of it, but something kept calling me back to it, as odd as it may sound. I was actually very entertained by the few opening pages, since Daisey sure has an odd way of 'knowing' himself and making fun of how (much of a slacker) he is and how he's gone about life so far being that way. Something else that caught me were his ficticious e-mails to Amazon's head, Jeff Bezos, which are a consistent way he has to wrap up every chapter in the book.<p>Granted that he keeps on bring in new "characters" into the story (he actually seems pretty good at disclosing when he's talking about a real person -his BizDev boss, Employee #5, for example- as opposed to when he's aggregating traits from several different characters into one, as a literary license -his peer Cody, for instance), the problem with the book is that his humorous style starts getting old after a few chapters. So, you can see how, when I was close to the middle, the book felt quite heavy. Yet I stuck with it. While I don't feel particularly fond (or sorry) that I did finish it (it is not like a lifechanging book, if you must know), I did find a couple of things of value beyond the sheer fun he insists on making of Amazon:<br>1) Regardless of what company you work for, it is not healthy to idealize them. All companies (like the people they're made up of), even the best ones have flaws, which makes any idealization of them a flawed process, destined to disilussion those who can't deal with anything but perfection from their "idols".<br>2) What goes around, comes around. The author (apparently) tried to go against what he truly was, in trying to be corporate, and it bit him back, because he was a slacker at heart, and as much as he satirized the company's behavior, his was no example to be followed. Simply put, no "wrong" deeds by an employer justify a wrong response by an employee. Still, it took him 21 dog years (3 human years) to realize he was just in the wrong place to start with: good for him that he left!<p>All in all, a book to read in little chunks or in one sitting. Not a source of overwhelming wisdom or a source of endless laughter, but a quite humourous & "philosophical" dot-com-mentary of sorts. A straight-up 3-star book.</span>

                    <span>There was a lot I could relate to in this book.  As a twenty-something college grad with a useless liberal arts degree living in Seattle during the dot.com boom, I was in the same boat as Mike Daisey.  I even applied for a customer service job at Amazon.com back when Mike did, but never heard back (after reading this book I realize I probably didn't quite meet the quirky/over-educated profile they were looking for).  However, anyone who's ever done customer service will immediately relate to Daisey's tales of dogmatic training classes, unpleasant customers, metrics-obsessed micro-managers, and the wide array of characters you find inhabiting the CSR position.<p>Once Daisey is promoted out of customer service into the nebulous "Business Development" department, the book loses some of its steam.  Not because there aren't more amusing tales of co-workers and pointless busy work, but because Daisey tries to turn his personal story into a commentary on the rise and fall of Amazon.com (if not the entire dot.com industry).  When he discusses the folly of Pets.com, it's nothing we haven't already heard, nor does it bring any additional insight to the countless news stories and books on the dot.com boom and bust.<p>I also found his self-analysis to be a bit overdone.  For the most part it didn't bother me, but by the end of the book he seems too determined to find meaning in his time at Amazon.com, when it is clear there is none.  <p>It also struck me as ironic that he could find so much fault in Jeff Bezos and the Amazon.com organization.  If anything, he got exactly what he wanted -- material to write and perform with.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book as a remainder for a couple of bucks, and still I feel ripped off. Daisey is a horrible writer, and the anecdotes are a bore. and believe me, this isn't even remotely close to being funny. (I am pretty sure I would find reading that old knock-knock joke with the punch line "Orange you glad I didn't say banana?" ten times more amusing than 21 Dog Years.) Why oh why can't I give 0 stars?<p>In a word, "Blecch!"</span>
