                <span id="Label1">This is a well-documented examination of the effects of human society on the global environment. Easterbrook's conclusion: Things are getting better, not worse. Not surprisingly, this book has generated considerable controversy in many circles of environmentalists and ecologists, and many of his arguments only apply to overly-developed nations. For example, he stumbles <I>badly</I> when dealing with tropical rainforests, completely ignoring the fact that clearcutting in tropical environments leads to essentially irreversible loss of soils and a sterile clay pan. But all in all, I recommend this book highly to everyone interested in the proper interpretation of long-term ecological trends. In my opinion, he is as often right as wrong, and habitual doomsday-sayers would do well to seriously consider and possibly adopt some of his positions on ecorealism.</span>

                    <span>I found that this book presented a more well rounded perspective of our environement. It is not writen from a conservationists view, but rather in a more open minded analytical way. It represents a open analysis of our interaction with the envrionment. I recomend this book to anyone who takes interest in our surroundings and the effects we place upon it. If you feel our world is being destroyed by human utilization, you MUST read this. Easterbrook leaves his audiance with a happy outlook to end on.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Easterbrook, while still maintaing a pro-environmental stance, points out the flaws of modern eco-philosophy. Anyone who feels they're a supporter of the movement should read the book.</span>

                    <span>Highly recommended for serious students of environmental policy. Easterbrook is one of the recognized experts - and founding thinkers - on environmental optimism. Whether you agree with him or not, this is a must-read.</span>

                    <span>I can see how those who are wrapped up in conservationism dislike this book, it shows them in a terrible light. If you think environmentalists are often histrionic and sanctimonious, you will like this book. If you think environmentalists are protecting what is truly sacred, you will find this book full of misinformed drivel.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>My sense from reading this book is neither that Easterbrook is a purposefully misleading, nor that he is particularly insightful. He is looking for an antitode to negativity that he seems to believe pervades the enrivonmental community.<BR>But whether you agree with his perspective or not, the simple fact is he gets many facts completely wrong, and his arguments are logically flawed. A prime example is the arguments he makes against the need for having regulations on air quality: he points out that the air has gotten cleaner in the US over the last 30 years. Well, yes it has, but BECAUSE of the clean air act, not in spite of it.<BR>There is no reason to be depressed about the environment, but nor is there any reason -- as Easterbrook would have us do -- to ignore it. If you want a balanced view, read the scientific literature, not the quasi-science of an naive journalist.</span>
