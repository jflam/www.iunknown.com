                <span id="Label1">A young, inexperienced team. Insurmountable odds. And the visionary coach that brought them to victory.  <P>During the 2000-2001 college basketball year, Mike Krzyzewski (Coach K) guided a very young and inexperienced Duke University team through a turbulent season filled with unexpected turns. Faced with everything from broken bones to humiliating losses, Coach K still managed to revamp his dispirited team and win the national championship. FIVE POINT PLAY is the story behind the winning season-the players, coaches, and motivational techniques utilized by Coach K, along with the players' feelings throughout this challenging time. Coach K proves that hard work, honesty, courage, and true teamwork can lead to the ultimate triumph.  <P>With his record of back-to-back NCAA championships, seven Final Fours, and one of the most successful basketball programs in the nation, Coach Krzyzewski is easily one of the most respected and recognized figures in all of sports.</span>

                    <span>Duke is on TV almost as much as Sponge Bob. I've probably missed five games in twenty-five years (including my time at Duke). After reading this book, I've missed all of them. The behind-the-scenes, locker-room perspective on how Coach K motivates players is powerful and moving. His preparation for each game centers less on the opponent and more on singling out one player on his own team to lift that player's game. His simple, direct message gets through.<BR>"Next Play," "Confidence Breeds Courage," "Collective Responsibility" and other catch-phrases of K's apply not only to basketball but to business and to life. <BR>How many coaches after winning the National Championship would bring their team back into the locker room two days later to remind them that the Lessons of the Fist (for what those are you have to read the book) apply not only to basketball but to life? How many, in the same meeting, would goad their players to excel not only on the basketball court but in the classroom and in life? <BR>This is a book to treasure.</span>

                    <span>Five-Point Play is the perfect companion to the 2000-2001 Basketball Season. I received the book from Amazon two days ago, and managed to read it in just a couple of hours. The book is a blow-by-blow account of how the Blue Devils grew and matured during its championship run. Five-Point Play is written in the same style as the ESPNMAG article that was written from Coach K's perspective.<P>Although I don't think one has to read "Leading with the Heart" to enjoy this book, I do think that one's enjoyment is definitely elevated by doing so. A lot of what Coach K emphasizes in Five-Point Play has distinct echoes from his previous book. Such important lessons as communication, trust, collective responsibility, caring, etc. are big themes that he re-emphasizes to the team. However, the primary difference is that in this book, Coach K follows the season in chronological order, with descriptions of practices and in-game situations. There are also several quotes from the players, coaches and staff that are inserted during these situations that further illuminate the different perspectives on the team. Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the book describe, in great detail, the team's psyche when Carlos suffered his foot injury and the team's subsequent shift in offensive and defensive strategies. In reality, there was a signifcant amount of doubt that the team would be able to be competitive by practically everyone on the team-- including Coach K! Fortunately, the Duke Blue Devils overcame this obstacle (among many others) and surged towards the National Championship.</span>

                    <span>I was going to flush this book down a toilet; however, I began to think that flushing the book would be disrespectful to the floating excrement. The only true way to enjoy this book is to rip out the contents, page by page, and then burn each one in effigy. I want to hear about Duke's championship season like I want to hear about a terrorist attack. He opens the book by name dropping, then name dropping some more, followed by name drops. I couldn't make it past the third page before my gag reflex kicked in and I started to salivate. I would soon lose my Chalupa. If you are still interested in reading this book, keep an extra bottle of Kaopectate on hand, as well as an apology letter to your dry cleaner.</span>

                    <span>Honestly, it's just a bunch of blather about how supereme Duke is and how despite everyone being injured the team overcomes impossible odds to win the title. Honestly, I don't recall this team being all that injury ridden. If you're a Duke fan, buy it. Everyone else, don't bother.</span>
