                    <span>I have been an NFL fan for 20+ years but, never having played the game, I didn't completely understood all the different player positions and their responsibilities. Joe Theismann did an outstanding job explaining the rules, positions, history and everything else about the game. I knew most of the basic rules but not all of them. For example, Joe explains which rules change in the final two minutes of each half. I believe anyone interested in football would benefit from reading this book, including beginners. I have started reading it a second time, there is so much good information. <P>P.S. I would rate this book 5 stars even if I wasn't a Joe Theismann and Washington Redskins fan!</span>

                    <span>This book has helped me go from first to worst in my fantasy league. Growing up in W. Virginia, we did not much about this American Football. My sporting endeavors tended mostly to the classic sports like discus and Greco-roman wresting. <P>It was very informative, but I was hoping to read more about some of the great figures in Football history. Lyle Alzado, Al Davis and Marv Levy.</span>

                    <span>if you know NOTHING about football from lack of interest or comprehesion, and the love-of-your-life knows EVERYTHING about football from the time he could speak...this book is a great help. you come away from this book knowing more than a little SOMETHING, and it becomes an excellent referrence guide. don't let your love see it until you are done...this is such a great read...you may not get it back for a while if you allow it to leave your hands. there's no boring, classroom type format-just clear fun info.</span>

                    <span>I started reading this book with no base knowledge about football at all when I started dating a Redskins fan. It was a fantastic introduction to the sport, to fandom, and to Redskins fandom specifically (Theismann *is* a little biased). It's well-organized, giving great overviews initially and gong into more depth further along. One caveat (of one big omission): there is no discussion of what a down is. At all. The book is best accompanied by a friend who already knows football and is willing to fill in the gaps. For the complete idiot, it provides not only a great look at the basics, but a good opportunity to impress friends who are fans with knowledge of some of the nuances of the game.</span>
