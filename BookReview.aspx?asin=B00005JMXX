                    <span>Hollywood has a long history of recording how the world may come to a spectacular end. Most of these films are long on special effects but short on human interest. In THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, director Roland Emmerich continues this tradition with Dennis Quaid as a climatologist who correctly predicts the onset of a world crunching ice age. Much of the attendant controversy of this film is spun by comparisons with the nonfiction doomsday thriller book, THE COMING GLOBAL SUPERSTORM by Art Bell, that suggests that global warming would melt the ice caps and the resulting intrusion of massive amounts of fresh water into the salty oceans would deflect the equatorial air and water flow that warms the western hemisphere. DAT is also a thinly veiled political allegory that suggests that the Republican refusal to accord with the Kyoto Protocols to reduce global warming is the primary reason for the cataclysm. The actor who plays the movie vice president is a dead ringer for Dick Cheney, who later sees third world countries like Mexico as the savior of what remains of America. <P>On a technical note, the hard science of DAT falls short of credibility since basic meteorological principles render it most unlikely that the Northern Hemisphere could be subject to a deep freeze in the time scale depicted. Still, other end-of-the-world-films like THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE (1961) offer superior scripts and acting to involve the audience even if the special effects were shoddy by today's standards. In DAT, the special effects range from convincing, computer-enhanced tornadoes wrecking Los Angeles, a tidal wave inundating Manhattan, and bowling ball hailstones pelting Tokyo. The human element revolves around Quaid hiking to Manhattan to find his son who is holed up in the New York Public Library. Director Emmerich did not hesitate to lift entire scenes and characters from an earlier film ICE AGE (1998), which dealt with similar themes: a president who is the last to leave the White House, a book lover arguing whether Dante's Inferno ought to be used for fuel, the hero risking death to find his family. What emerges from the frozen muck of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a film that is surprisingly fun and involving. The viewer may not be convinced that we are headed for a real life Big Freeze, but that viewer almost certainly had the visual ride of his life.</span>

                    <span>Certainly, it is yet another disaster movie, but we film-goers have a huge appetite for disasters. The film makers will keep making them as long as we keep paying to watch them. In my opinion some reviewers have been too harsh about this one. It's not bad, as disaster movies go. There are some very good special effects that save it from being the unworthy crock some people are suggesting.<P>In this film, the Northern hemisphere is covered by big, rotating clouds - there are 3 of them: one for Canada/USA, one for Europe and one for Siberia. The heroes are American (of course) with a nod to a small knot of British climatologists (or meteorologists) shivering over their tea and biscuits in Scotland. The warnings about possible climate change, brought about by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and hacking and burning forests, had been largely ignored by those in the strongest position to do something about it. And now it's too late. The switch to colder global temperatures has been flipped. The genii is out of the bottle and cannot be put back. The course of events is inexorable. The polar ice begins to melt at an alarming rate. The Atlantic conveyor (the ocean current that carries warm water to the cold regions where it gets all cold and salty so that it sinks and flows back to the warmer regions) is altered when a critical desalination point is reached. Climate stability is lost. There are huge storms - unseasonable and in unexpected places. Great flocks of birds fill the sky over New York - a portent of doom - flying south. A huge dome of ocean crashes over Manhattan. Those who survive the drowning are subjected to blizzards and rapid freezing. Wolves stalk the streets. People who are able to, flee south, where they find the Mexican border closed to them. It all looks pretty grim. There's been a sudden catastrophic climate change and the planet is plunged into a new ice age.<P>The quality of the cinematography and CGI, as good as they are, don't make a good story unnecessary, but they still help the film to be very enjoyable despite a high degree of schmaltz. The wolves are obviously computer generated (just as well because one of them gets a series of vicious clouts with a torch and a couple of them have bone-crushing collisions with walls and doors) but the flocks of birds and the movement of water, snow and ice are very realistic. The acting and the dialogue are not bad but the human interest element of the story really is a bit sickly. Now that I've watched the film a few times, I find I just skip all the emotional goo and go straight to the entertaining parts - mostly the special effects. Examples that impressed and entertained me (the sort of clips they show on the trailers):<P> the breaking off of the Larsen B Antarctic ice shelf<BR> the rash of tornados tearing Los Angeles apart<BR> the huge wave that crashed over the statue of liberty and into New York<BR> the quick freeze flag<BR> the discovery in the library of a section of publications on tax law that nobody - not even the most devoted bibliophile - would mind burning in order to keep warm<P>There are a few extras. The commentaries are fairly interesting. The trailers are useful. I now know that I want to see "I Robot" and also "Alien vs. Predator" looks interesting though we only see the 'creature workshop' and not any part of the film. The menu programme on this single disc edition is not too good. If you press the menu button, instead of going back to the menu, as happens with most DVDs, this takes you straight back to the interminable warnings about pirating films and you can't skip them. So best not to press the menu button if you just wanted to select a different scene for example. On balance, I think this is an entertaining film and well worth the price. If you like disaster films, you should enjoy this.</span>

                    <span>The Day after Tomorrow is a outstanding movie. The special effects are awesome. I was not sure about the movie at first but after I rented it from blockbuster and viewed it, I definitely will buy it on dvd fullscreen. There have been a few movies made involving natural diasters but this one is the best. If you have not seen it yet, definitely watch it. The director did a fantastic job, the cast members put a outstanding job. It's one of those movies you'll want to watch again and again. </span>

                    <span>If you've seen the 1997 sci-fi hit "Independence Day", then for all practical purposes you've seen this movie too. The only real difference is that instead of a bunch of ticked-off aliens, the threat of human extinction comes from a ticked-off "Mother Nature". In the former, however, it was all about "us versus them" and the triumph of the human will to survive. In "Day After Tomorrow", the message is: "We have met the enemy, and they are the Republicans."<P>Yeah, the movie is about the epic struggle to survive in the face of an overwhelming natural catastrophe, but it's pretty obvious that the producers were less interested in telling a story and more concerned about sending an election-year political message. From the early scenes of the movie, the "hero" character (a very forgettable paleoclimatologist played by Dennis Quaid) serves as the "voice crying in the wilderness" against the environmentally unsound excesses of corporate America. He warns of the doomsday scenario which does in fact unfold throughout the movie, but the heavily stereotyped conservative politicians (who are, no doubt, in the pockets of the polluters) shrug off his warnings. Maybe it's just me, but I thought the "vice president" character looked uncannily like Dick Cheney. Coincidence? I don't think so, but feel free to decide for yourself.<P>The main story is about a dysfunctional family whose members find themselves separated by the unpredictable (yet somehow predicted) chain of natural events. Of course, the events aren't really natural -- they're caused by foolish and greedy men who fail to pay attention to the needs of Mother Earth. Somehow, against incredible odds, the family manages to reunite, save the human race, and resolve their own domestic issues all at the same time. And of course, the tale is duly concluded with the humiliation of America and its (implied Republican) leaders, as well as some cheap jabs at American immigration policy.<P>In short, this is enviro-hysteria at its cheesy best, but election year political propaganda at its worst. There isn't even a mild attempt to veil the message -- it's right there in your face. If you're a Bush-hater, you'll cheer. If you're a little more honest with yourself, you'll see this film for the cheap trash that it is. The ONLY reason I gave it a second star was because it was chock full of stunning visual effects from beginning to end. Beyond that, your enjoyment of this movie will stand in direct relation to your political affiliation. That's no way to make a movie.</span>
