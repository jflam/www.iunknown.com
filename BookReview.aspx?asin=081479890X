                    <span>This is a very good book, but it needs more information about how government schools started the problem that Brown ended. When government began socializing schools in the late 1800's, it expanded government-mandated racism. Brown v Board of Education stopped government's massive racism imposed on everyone in government schools.  The book let's the government say that its raining, after peeing on everyone's head. <p>Even the Pledge of Allegiance (1892) was written by a bigot who was a self-proclaimed national socialist and advocated that government should operate all schools. The government forced children to attend segregated schools where they recited the Pledge using it's original straight-arm salute.<p>The book doesn't attempt to quantify the monstrous impact of socialized schools teaching racism for so long. <p>It is fortunate that the Constitution prevented government churches, or the same tragedy would have resulted. <p>In addition to ending government's racism, Brown should have ended government schools. As libertarians say: The separation of school and state is as important as the separation of church and state.</span>
