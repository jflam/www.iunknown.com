                    <span>Like the author i can remember the books i read as a child (with great fondness), i have those books even today, and like her they are my old and familiar friends. But unlike her most of those books have been nonfiction, for i thought/think those were the way to see the real world. After reading this book i realize that the gap i thought existed between nonfiction and fiction isn't really important. For she sees books, like i imagine most readers do, as a funny kind of mirror which reflects the reader's inner world at the same time as displaying the author's world. I think the gap is between readers and nonreaders, who like those described this book as visual or picture people, identify with films rather than books. The book is a memoir which asks the big question on our reading minds-- does it matter if i can't remember what is in the books? She answers it- "For in the end, even if all my books where to vanish, I would still have them somewhere, if I had read them attentively enough. Maybe the words on the page are not even the true book, in the end only a gateway to the book which recreates in the mind and lasts as long as we do." The book is a real treat for anyone who like her, is often asked, "haven't you wasted your life, by reading rather than experiencing life?" She answers this with the thought that her life is so intertwined with the books she has read and thereby experienced, and so made a part of her. That it doesn't matter, which is books and which is real life for they together make her, her. It's a good book, short, poignant with echoes and parallels apparent to any readers life. Go for it, spend a pleasant hour with this book.</span>

                    <span>This is part personal memoir, as the author tells about her own<BR>childhood and the books that influenced her, and part essay on<BR>why we read and how what we reads shapes our lives. <P>Schwartz begins with the key question: Why do we read? One<BR>Buddhist scholar she quotes says that reading is a handicap. "It<BR>is better to keep your own mind free and to not let the thinking<BR>of others interfere with your own free thinking." As she thinks<BR>about her own life, she realizes that she doesn't remember much<BR>of what she's read and wonders if this means that she has not<BR>gained by it.<P>She even commits heresy by saying that she has managed "not to<BR>finish certain books," and is proud of it. Still, she is unable<BR>to throw away any of those unread books; they remain on her<BR>shelves, even those she feels have no merit. She may hide them on<BR>a high shelf, but they remain part of her life.<P>She finally concludes that "unlike love, reading is a pure<BR>activity. It will gain us nothing but enchantment of the heart."<BR>But for those of us who are "book addicts, perhaps that is<BR>enough.<P>This is a rather short book (119 pages), but I think book lovers<BR>will enjoy it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>THE PLOT Schwarz starts from a commentary by a Chinese scholar that some people are handicapped by reading too much, and not thinking enough about what they read. From there, she looks at the books she has read in her life and the role they have played. It is not a particularly serious tone throughout, but rather a personal commentary on the books that have been important to her in her life, and the elements of her life that took place in and around books.<P>WHAT I LIKED - Emptying your mind for meditation vs. filling it up during a life spent reading (pg. 14) - On the un-importance of the authors vs. the impact of the words themselves (pg. 17) - A life spent reading (pg. 96) - Choices of reading material (pg. 107) - Ruined by reading (pg. 114) - On self (pg. 119)<P>OVERALL RATING Certainly not a serious tome, but the tone was pleasant, the writing fair, and the material thoughtfully presented. Give it a 3.5 out of 5.0.</span>

                    <span>reading is a common subject matter, countless books have been written on the subject. But here, the author takes a lighthearted but very personal look at the impact of books, and reading, on her life. She probes the question that is seldom addressed - just what impact does reading actually have? Is reading living, or just the written record of living? If we read and then forget, how has what we're read impacted us? Does reading make us a better person? Or even a different person? While everyone will have their own answers to these questions, I enjoyed the author's unstructured reminiscences and ruminations, appreciative that she would share this portion of herself with other booklovers who also ponder these abstracts. One thinks of Louis L'amour's rambling biography, for while these two authors are world's apart in personality & perspective, both are confirmed, card-carrying bookaholics, just sharing their love of and commitment to the written word.</span>

                    <span>This book emphasises the joy words can bring and ignores theme and plot, treating them as secondary aspects of a book; Schwartz reminisces about bindings, memories, and everything but the philosophical ideas behind what she's read. It's cute for about a page before it turns dangerous.<P>To take everything she says without at least a pound of salt is to rob literature of its primary purpose, which is to educate. (Books entertain; literature educates.) By treating meaning and purpose as secondary aspects of books and instead speaking of her wonderful friendships with them, Schwartz devalues their artistic statements. Books say things; they are not written to be read and forgotten.<P>Of course there are more problems than this. Ruined by Reading is a clunky, slow read with an airy, self-indulgent tone. Schwartz tries to impress the reader with how much she is able to get into and enjoy books, but succeeds only in boring him/her to tears. This is not a good read unless the reader, too, flatters himself/herself and convinces him/herself that s/he's identifying with every word about being totally absorbed in and dependent on books.<P>I got nothing out of this book whatseover. It was not fun to read; it added no insight to the business of reading; and it devalued modern literature by focusing entirely on the goofy little memories it stirs up instead of the meaning and philosophy that should not be ignored. It's a short book, thankfully, so go ahead and read it if you're curious, but I'm warning you, there's nothing worth reading here.</span>
