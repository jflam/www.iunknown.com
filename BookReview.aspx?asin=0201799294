The book's step-by-step exercises use the "Lights of the Coast" project Web site to introduce you to Dreamweaver's powerful tools and the best ways to use them. By recreating the sample Web site through the lessons, you'll gather the skills you need to develop sites, working in both visual and code editing environments, that are accessible to a wide audience. The lessons in this easy-to-follow guide provide 18-20 hours of tutorials, which start with the basics of creating a Web page and progressively add in more complex tasks such as working with text, graphics, and tables. You don't need any prior Dreamweaver experience to grasp these easy-to-follow lessons, which, while based on a sample project, provide you with all of the techniques and confidence to build your own full-featured Web sites. </BODY></HTML></span>

                    <span>If you are looking for a book to help you to learn the basics of Dreamweaver MX, then you have found it in this one. The chapters and lessons are well-designed to teach the concepts.<P>Back when I got this book, I was already very experienced with web design and tools, but not with Dreamweaver. This book teaches both Dreamweaver and a lot of basic web design concepts. So, I was able to skim over some sections that were too basic and still gain familiarity with DW. <P>The time estimates for each chapter were a bit too generous. I finished one chapter 45 minutes faster than they had estimated. Others were closer to being accurate. It makes sense that the time estimates would be off by some amount, depending upon the level of the reader.<P>Some of the chapters have an "on your own" bonus exercise at the end where one can apply the skills they just covered to building a web page with no step-by-step instructions. That is where you will find out if you were paying attention in the earlier parts of the chapter. Don't skip these bonus lessons!<P>I needed a way to get up to speed with DW and this book did the trick. Dreamweaver simplifies a lot of tasks that I had been performing manually, so learning it has made me more efficient in my work. This book, and Dreamweaver, are great investments for people who desire to craft attractive web sites in less time. The return on investment was almost immediate for me.<P>The book pays for itself quickly.</span>

                    <span>"Dreamweaver MX: Training from the Source" is an excellent step-by-step *tutorial* that trains the reader on the basics of using DW MX. It is not a complete *reference* where you can find any in-depth discussions on different topics or even advanced web programming techniques. I do keep the tutorial for a reference on techniques, but check out "Dreamweaver MX: The Complete Reference" for more advanced treatment. Rather, the book shows the reader how to create tables, forms, CSS, and simple JavaScript with DW MX. Each chapter covers an individual feature of DW MX with step-by-step instructions and ample pictures to guide the reader. (Honestly, you really have to be brain-dead to get lost following the instructions.)<P>I would recommend that prospective readers have some exposure and experience with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The book focuses on how to create and add web features via DW MX. In my opinion, the ideal reader will be one already familiar with some web programming techniques and design but want to know how to actually use DW MX to create their sites. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I was familiar with pre-MX versions of Dreamweaver, and this book allowed a great refresher course that cleaned a few cobwebs and taught many new features along the way. Teaching method very similar to hands-on projects/case studies in college; the best method to learn the myriad of the software's capabilities is to apply it! Included file disk makes it easy to skip ahead to lessons for more advanced users (i.e. each lesson comes with its up-to-this-respective-lesson's files, such that lesson 10 does not require you to successfully complete lessons 1-9; just copy lesson 10's files!)<P>For those users looking to start a static website (v. dynamic...do a simple websearch if you don't know the difference) this book is a GREAT starting point. Taking your site to the dynamic level will require - prepare yourself for this - the "DYNAMIC Applications" edition (book 2 of this series). I could not help but pick this book up as well.<P>For intermediate users, expect the "time approximation" for each section to be a conservative measure. I find that if it says it will take an hour, I usually get through it in 30-45 minutes, pending restroom breaks.<P>One word of advice: the entire project may seem overwhelming looking at its entirety. However, breaking it down lesson by lesson, you will find that the piecemeal approach avoids the intimidation factor associated with the overall project. It's quite impressive to finish the series and look back to from where you started!</span>

                    <span>I must admit when I first opened this book (even though I still decided to keep it anyway), I found the amount of text and steps in each chapter rather daunting -- so I became a little impatient, set the book aside for 6 months and avoided using Dreamweaver MX altogether. Since I primarily do web design as a hobby, I wondered if I was getting in over my head with version MX.<P>Recently, I've been asked to redesign our company's website and decided it would be a good time to finally dive in and learn MX (I have used Dreamweaver 3 exclusively since 1999 and never upgraded to version 4). So far, I have found this book to be very helpful and have gone though most of the lessons in 3 days!! <P>I picked up lots of great tips and new ways to use the software that I did not originally anticipate. The chapter on Cascading Style Sheets was especially informative and clear, and I no longer feel intimidated about using them in a website (and now feel silly that I never did...).<P>Overall, the book is an excellent resource if you have the patience to read LOTS of copy, but all the essential features of the software are thoroughly covered. The book provided a solid foundation for learning the basics and I found it to be a good review. The chapters could have used a few more illustrations, but were packed with lots of substance.<P>Is this book for advanced users? Probably not -- but for the rest of us, it's a useful guide to MX.</span>

                    <span>I had a little HTML knowledge when I bought and installed Dreamweaver MX, but no web design experience. I was afraid to even open it! I bought this book because it was recommended for beginners. It starts by holding your hand and walking you through the workspace explaining all the tool bars and panels and how they're docked. I laugh now at, "Rest the pointer over a button to see it's name", but I wasn't laughing when I started the book. <P>Training From The Source guides you through creating a web site about light houses called "Lights of the Coast". Although I never want to see another light house after completing the lessons, it was an excellent way of applying what I was learning. I also liked the list of "What You Will Learn" at the start of each chapter, and "What You Have Learned" at the end of each chapter, to keep me on track. The illustrations are numerous and just what I needed back when I was afraid to touch anything. <P>There is a huge amount of information throughout the book I previously knew nothing about. Reading and working through it saved me from a lot of headaches when I set off on my own. Good book!</span>
