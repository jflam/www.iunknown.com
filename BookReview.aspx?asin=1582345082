                    </div>
                    <span>The Line of Beauty is an extraordinarily well-crafted novel with a nearly flawless story arc (hmmm...perhaps a metaphor in and of itself?) and what could be called a perfectly paced plotline. It is Jamesian more in scope than in tone with a rich, diversity of characters inhabiting a world that is subtly complex. Each conversation is fraught with subtext. Hollinghurst's intricate world of sex, drugs and politics in the 1980's is treated with the same curious blend of compassion and detachment that Henry James used nearly a century earlier. It is a world at once familiar and foreign and, while Hollinghurst's view is deliberately Post-Modern there still remains a Jamesian sympathy toward even the most unlikable of characters. While I can understand how a reader might initially regard the characters as being a bit unsympathetic, after finishing the novel, I completely disagree. Yes, at times, these characters appear to live lives that seemed rather vapid and lacking in meaning and direction, but it is essential to keep in mind that that depiction is a deliberate choice by the author. Like James, Hollinghurst creates a rarified world where moral and ethical values exist in a world entirely apart from the reader. (Well, at least the average, person not hailing from a fabulously rich and politically embedded London family.) Like James, Hollinghurst presents his characters intimately, yet objectively - without judgment or undue color - but this does not mean that they are in any way unsympathetic. By the final pages it became nearly impossible not to feel for Nick and, in fact, nearly all of the characters. Without giving away too much, there is a nearly overwhelming sense of alienation and sorrow that is so beautifully rendered that the reader cannot help but reinterpret the story that precedes it. Oh, and as to what one reviewer referred to as "needlessly graphic gay sex" and another referred to as "sexy" the choice is yours. Personally, I found it to be the latter, but if it not your thing, it will only serve to increase the sense of genteel estrangement Hollinghurst's world provides. </span>

                    <span>Yes, he writes beautifully.  Yes, his portrayals are vivid and often satirical, his mockery of upper-crust individuals is enjoyable.  Yes, he is learned, with clever references to Henry James, to music, to antique furniture and to other aspects of culture.  Yes, Nick, the central character, ever anxious to fit in and to please and never quite certain whether he is saying the right thing, is especially well drawn.   Yes, there are many deft touches in symbolism and in plot.  But I found too much in this book that repelled me.  I am not homophobic, but I do find it distasteful when an author, however well he writes, revels in describing randy promiscuity, whether homosexual or heterosexual.  Yes, Nick comes to have genuine affection for three other men (of whom one is unobtainable), but at the same time he is sordidly promiscuous elsewhere, in lavatories, with a waiter at a country house party, and involved in threesomes.  And he is endlessly fantasising, roused by the outlines of other men's genitals and buttocks. It may be argued that Hollinghurst is simply giving a realistic description of this kind of behaviour in a cautionary tale:  after all, Nick's two lovers, as promiscuous as he is, die of AIDS and the book ends with Nick himself due for an AIDS test. But I don't buy that:  it seems to me that the behaviour, described in gross detail (in one place, for example, Nick caresses his friend's genitals through his trouser pocket), is narrated with the relish of a pornographer.  I cannot admire a book like that, however cleverly it is written.

                    <span>While the sex scenes are a little graphic and hard to take, I took it more to mean that the main character is going through some serious changes to adulthood, comging out in the 80s in Britain must not have been easy, and living in a high profile family's house adds to the danger. Of course, in a way, though, the main character feeds off of that. 
<br />
<br />The part that made me think the most though, was how the family who hosted him dealt with the final exposure. Were they right to do what they did? He was living in their house for years, and like his boyfriend, the reader must be thinking "let this guy get his own place." I was torn between siding with the high profile family, and siding with the newly out gay boy. 
<br />
<br />One area the author does well is show through the story how that generation had to deal with AIDS; all of his former partners, and their partners, dying off, also struck me as a narrative line beneath the British priggish politics (the love of Thatcher, the preppiness, etc.). Dancing with M. Thatcher while high, while teasing a waiter, who he finds has been seeing his boyfriend regularly, this is all layers of superficiality and deception.
<br />
<br />I liked the author's use of James to set the context of the artifacts of wealthy life, his aesthetic uselessness to Wani's family, and how he was so obsessed with beauty (thus Wani) ... and therefore superficiality... and how Wani loses that beauty in the end. Is love superficial? Yes, it's annoying that the main character isn't more meaningful. But in a way, the meaningful thing is that he's not meaningful. As he tells the younger sister at one point, isn't finding someone beautiful all love is about anyways?</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Winner of Britain's prestigious Booker Prize, Hollinghurst's elegant, eloquent novel explores the Thatcherite era (in three sections, 1983, 1986 and 1987) and the changing social mores of the `80s; the London gay scene and the coming of AIDs. 
<br />
<br />Hollinghurst's upper class set live in gorgeous mansions casually graced with Cézannes over the dining table and Louis Seize commodes in the bathroom and Herbert von Karajan on the radio. His protagonist, Nick Guest, 23 at the start, son of an antiques appraiser, has a room in the attic of an Oxford classmate's parents' London home, while he pursues his graduate work in the literature of Henry James.
<br />
<br />The house is home to Gerald Fedder, Member of Parliament, his wealthy wife, his unstable, angry daughter, Catherine (who Nick baby-sits when her urge for self-mutilation becomes overwhelming), and Toby, Nick's friend and secret crush. Toby, however, is thoroughly straight. A slightly older man, Leo, a black Jamaican, definitely not upper class, initiates Nick into the lusty mysteries of sex.
<br />
<br />Immersed in the heady realms of wealth and privilege, Nick is tentative and shy, even cowardly, but soon he has left Leo behind and immersed himself in a dangerous, fast-track, glittering world of drugs and sex and a secret affair with a super-wealthy former classmate, Wani, who is engaged to be married.
<br />
<br />Hollinghurst explores Thatcherite politics and scandal, and gay life in the dawn and devastating early days of AIDS, as well as issues of class, cowardice, and pleasure. The prose is exquisite, with Jamesian richness, attention to detail and character nuance, and the satire is subtle and sly. Nevertheless, a young man's obsession with sex, no matter how gorgeously and wittily described, grows tedious, and Nick's immersion in the life is his first and foremost preoccupation.
