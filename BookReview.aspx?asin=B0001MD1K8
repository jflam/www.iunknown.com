                    <span>In reading eBay Secrets : How to create Internet auction listings that make 30% more money while selling every item you list, I was thoroughly astounded by the mechanisms deployed in order to be successful. 
<br />
<br />It is not rocket-science - as a matter of fact I think that's where the book's success lies - keeping it simple and straightforward to realise maximum benefit by applying these strategies. Also, the fact that it's immediately applicable. 
<br />
<br />A second remark would be to now go and test these strategies in other markets on other sites. e-Bay most definitely has the upper hand due to the volumes of traffic that uses this environment daily. It would be interesting to seek the fine-tuning nuances in lesser volumed markets, by still applying these mechanisms. 
<br />
<br />Else than that, all in all an excellent read for immediate practical application which I would highly recommend.

                    <span>I bought this book in desperation.  I had not been getting what I wanted for items that I was selling on eBay.  I realized that I was making some very serious mistakes - especially regarding the titles and descriptions that I was using.  Further, the method that I was using (or, rather, not using) to tell the user what shipping would cost, and using reserve auctions was truly hurting my final prices.  I really appreciated the practical tips on where to find items to sell.  Steve gave me some ideas that I really would not have thought of on my own.  I would highly recommend this book to those who want to improve their eBay selling success.  However, the buyer should make sure that they have a basic working knowledge of computers, a photo editor, and an HTML editor.  These skills will help you to implement the author's suggestions.  These are not mandatory, but will definitely help.
<br />This book is written in an informal, easy-to-read and pleasant manner.  I read it in under an hour and learned at least 40 new things.  That's money well spent.</span>

                    <span>I learned very little from this book, and some of the material is over-simplified.  The "Bid Multiplier Method" works better for some items than others -- for example, some rarer items such as books that have limited appeal but are still hard to find will not sell for top dollar using this method -- if you only have one or two potential bidders your item will not skyrocket.  Also, ebay is different that it used to be -- people are savvy to high shipping charges, especially on cheaper items, and ebay now can calculate shipping charges based on ZIP, which is not mentioned here.  There is no mention of using search items inside the deciption for more experienced buyers.  That being said, this is a great primer for beginners -- it will tell you how to avoid a lot of the mistakes that novices make and it will also give you some useful tips.  Worth the money if you're new to selling -- especially if you just want to sell your own personal items -- but if you're already a sucessful business seller I'd give it a pass.</span>
