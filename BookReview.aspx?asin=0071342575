                    <span>Great examples of cover letters with explanation of what makes them great, but I only know this because I bought the printed version after not being able to read the examples AT ALL in the downloaded digital version.  I even tried reading on a 19" high resolution monitor using the PC version of Microsoft Reader, .<p>The problem is that even though Microsoft Reader allows one to change the fonts of the print to suit the reader, scanned images like ALL the cover letter examples are not scalable, so it is impossible to distinguish an e from an o, l from an i, and so on. <p>Amazon should not sell books with graphics and fixed images in digital format, or at least should warn customers of the issue before they pay to download a book in digital format that has over  70% in unscalable, unreadable format.</span>

                    <span>This book was a great investment!  The cover letters give you examples to use in your own letter and show you the strengths found in each cover.  I actually took a highlighter to this book and highlighted my favorite lines and ideas out of certain letters.  I then implemented them into my letter.  Great for everyone, the professional or the inexperienced.  YOU NEED THIS BOOK!</span>

                    <span>I was very disappointed with this purchase. The only subject the letters cover is for use in getting a job. If I had known that it was strictly targeting getting a job I would have never purchased this. I was looking for a book that had a variety of letters you would find useful in the business world, not getting a job.</span>
