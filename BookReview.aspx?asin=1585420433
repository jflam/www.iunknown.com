                    <span>A very thoughtful book.  Paints a vivid portrait of the major issues we will be facing this century.  I highly recommend it for anyone seeking to understand what future demographics has in store for us, and how we should prepare for it.</span>

                    <span>A book everyone would benefit from reading. It's a MUST read. Not only are the issues well presented with clear and insightful facts, but thoughtful answers are presented - solutions we can all begin to pursue. I didn't realize, as educated as I am, that I knew so little about this issue. Great wake up call!</span>

                    <span>After reading this book at the insistence of a college I have come to the conclusion that this is nothing more than another<br>attempt to force "lite" socialism down our throats with fear mongering.  The good doctor is kind enough to scare people<br>into believing in his utopian remedies.  What ever happened to individual responsibility?  This work was so self serving and liberal in its content that I wish I could give it a quarter of a star.</span>

                    <span>This book maps out the terrain that 76 million people are now entering.  The social implications are dealt with at length. The thought of living in poverty in one's 'Golden Years' should sound an alarm for boomers who are addicted to consumption and worse yet the 'Plastic Enabler'.  I have purchased copies for my siblings whose devil may care attitudes of today presage a painful tommorrow.  Definitive studies on the physical effects of aging are being done by companies like Geron Corp.whose "telomerase" technology could reveal a basis for aging and the slowing or reversal of its effects.</span>

                    <span>In my opinion the author is completely off base with his theories.  I don't see how this book can help anyone of any age.  I'm glad this was a borrowed book.  My time could have been better spent on a cheap romance novel.</span>
