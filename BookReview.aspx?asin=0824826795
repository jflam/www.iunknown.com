                    <span>"The Blessings of Bhutan" is a personal and fascinating compilation of very short, and very readable, essays (or "sketches") about authors Russ and Blyth Carpenter's experiences and understanding of Bhutanese life. The book is separated into eight parts covering Bhutanese culture and geography; ancient Bhutanese religion and its relationship to Buddhism and Bhutanese archery; Tantric Buddhism; Bhutanese art and medicine; reincarnation (especially as it applies to the environment); sexuality in Bhutanese culture; women in Bhutan; and the Carpenter's reflections on Bhutan's policy of "Gross National Happiness" and on Bhutan's future. The book also has a very useful glossary of terms that makes reading much easier as well as a recommending reading list.<P>The authors' love and admiration of Bhutan and Bhutanese people is very apparent in their sketches. While many things about Bhutan can easily baffle a tourist (like the almost contradictory sexual attitude of the Bhutanese or the concept of "Gross National Happiness"), they explain these things in terms of the Bhutanese culture. I found the book extremely easy to read and engaging, and appreciated the experiences the Carpenters shared as well as the facts. You can read the book back to front or just skip around and read about which aspects of the culture you're interested in. <P>This is the first book I have read about Bhutan, and I'm glad I got it!</span>

                    <span>Absolutely one of the best books that I have read on the country of Bhutan. After reading several chapters, I was ready to travel on one of the tours to Bhutan, which are led by authors Russ and Blyth Carpenter.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This meaty little book is informed by the experience of the authors'numerous visits (including working trips) to Bhutan, extensive research, and the wisdom of many lively but respectful conversations with Bhutanese friends. Gorgeous color photographs by the authors supplement the vivid, lucid writing. There is intrigue in seeimg how these two self-described linear thinkers are gradually changed by confronting an intuitive culture with a Tantric lifestyle and a heritage of both Tibetan Buddhism and the remnants of the pre-Buddhist Bon religion. What will be the effect of television, which has only now entered the culture, on this relatively isolated culture? What do monks do all day? What does it mean to measure a culture by its Gross National Happiness? Why is Bhutan known as Little Switzerland? These are among the many questions the Carpenters answer. One could not have better guides to this intriguing country.</span>

                    <span>This is a marvelous series of sketches that illuminate the mystique of Bhutan. The Carpenters, through their work and travel in and love for Bhutan, bring a personal and western perspective to a unique part of the world. Blessings of Bhutan serves as a bridge for the western traveler that allows for full appreciation of the uniqueness of Bhutan as a destination and a way of life.</span>

                    <span>"The Blessings of Bhutan" describes a unique view of the people, religion and culture of Bhutan. It is based on first hand experiences of Russ and Blyth Carpenter over several years of exploration, living and philanthropic work there. They have become deeply involved in the lives of these wonderful people and have been rewarded with a bird's eye view including some rather un-Western but honest approaches to life. I highly recommend this book which can be read all at once or random chapters of interest.</span>
