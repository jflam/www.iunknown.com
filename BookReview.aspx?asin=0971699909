                    <span>Ok, first I have to admit, I'm a huge fan of UCONN basketball, Diana Taurasi in particular, but that doesn't make me biased:). I think this book is well written, fun to read, funny, and insightful. It tels the story of an amazing basketball team that deserves recognition even though they didn't reach their final goal. I learned a lot from this book, and it made me laugh and cry. I think that anyone who has interest in women's basketball will enjoy this book, especially if you are a fan of the UCONN huskies. Go huskies!:)</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>After winning the 2004 NCAA Championship, UConn senior Maria Conlon said, "I feel like it was just yesterday we were lying in the locker room in St. Louis crying our eyes out, saying we never wanted to have this feeling again.  Sure enough, we never did."<p>Perhaps the true greatness of the 00-01 Huskies can only now be appreciated.  Could Taurasi & Co hunger for excellence without first knowing the bitterness of falling just short?  This book can add fuel to the argument.</span>
