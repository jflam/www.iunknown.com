                <span id="Label1">With his usual mix of enthusiasm, optimism, and anecdote, Dr. Wayne Dyer is back again to emphasize that we are in control of our life experiences. Quoting everything from the Bible to <I>The Tao of Pooh</I>, he returns continually to his central point: with truth and self-awareness, all things are possible, including physical healing, improved relationships, and great personal accomplishment. <I>There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem</I> dissects what is meant by the word <I>problem</I> and shows us how to achieve our deepest wishes with surprisingly simple suggestions.<p> Illustrating the possibilities with a variety of stories and letters, Dyer manages to nicely balance the whimsical with the practical. On one page, you'll find straightforward advice like, "If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you. Be honest and frank anyway." In the next section, you'll find a long explanation of the importance of finding "the potential to keep your field of energy uncontaminated." Some may find this disconcerting, yet it also allows careful readers to search out the particular story or method that works for them. Anecdotes from addicts, parents whose children have died, and hospital patients are strewn throughout the book, as are references to Dyer's previous works and lengthy passages from other spiritual authors. In every case, these stories showcase the power of positive thinking and using those positive thoughts to manifest positive change. Although this attempt at changing the world one thought at a time is not vastly different in tone or message from Dyer's previous works, his fans will nevertheless appreciate it. <I>--Jill Lightner</I> </span>

                    <span>I have read the book, watched the DVD and have been able to put ego in it's place and within the silence, hear what matters most. Ego is something that needs to be worked on everyday, as there are always challenging moments that can easily bring that ego or need to be right into play and thus, in a moment, we disconnect from Source. Trusting in the Source is truly an awakening. Letting go and letting God, needs to be a daily discipline until it becomes a natural path without thought. 
<br />
<br />My daughter said to me when she was only 7 .. "Dad, I don't want to grow up ... why don't you grow down" .. here was a child in a happier spiritual place than I was. At age 7 she became one of my mastermind teachers and I the student. 
<br />
<br />The Power of Intention is a book that should be reread many times, it's just that good. I personally have a great respect for Wayne's endless research, sense of humour and amazing ability to communicate a thought so clearly. He is genuine in every way.

                    <span>Wayne wows me again!  Excellent tape set, I've listened to it many times through.  These tapes bring showering and scrubbing the toilet to a new spiritual level.  I find Buddha in the bathtub, Shiva in the shower, quotes from the Tao while making the tacos.  Wayne is da man, he shows us dat we can....find a spiritual solution to every problem.

                    <span>Wayne Dyer brings tremendous gifts of answers in this of his many fantastic books. He shows us all how to tap into our spiritual self, finding a higher reason for the problems that we encounter, while at the same time showing us the spiritual gifts that await us once we become aware of them, by viewing our "problems" from a divine perspective. This is a wonderful book, filled with promise and hope. It's a great read! </span>

                    <span>I read many of the reviews here about this book with fascination.  I have read just about every Dyer book out there, listened to every tape set and attended his seminars.  I can say Dr. Dyer has gone through an evolutionary process and I have followed along with him, which is probably why I find his material seems to resonate with me.  He first started with books that put forth "mind over matter" advice - you know "if you don't mind it doesn't matter" type of thinking.  Dr. Dyer helped people to take control of their emotions and reactions in order to have better lives.  This was a decidely more practical, psychological point of view.  Over the years, Dr. Dyer became more spiritually aware and his work shifted toward tapping into our energy fields, higher self and God/Universe to tap into our potential.  Some folks are at the stage where the earlier works will be of more value while others will find the newer material meets them where they are.  This book met me where I was and I really value it.  If you want concrete steps on how to work with your mind and emotions, read his earlier books.  If you want a more "New Age" approach, for lack of a better term, then this book is excellent.  All of his books have value, you just need to match them to where you are and where you are is exactly the place you need to be right now - there's no right or wrong place to be.  It's also good to realize that no one author has "all the answers" and that all of Dyer's materials are another source of wisdom that you may or may not want to incorporate into your life right now. </span>

                    <span>This is a great series of tapes put out by Wayne Dyer.  In this program he covers all areas of life, health, enlightenment, prosperity, love, happiness and many other areas.
<br />If you live with doubt and feel disconnected spiritually, this is the program for you!
<br />Wayne has always had a gift of making spirituality very, very accessable and even fun.  These tapes are a great example of that.  
<br />As usual, he also directs you to a vast array of resources that even go beyond his teachings and directs you to other great books and teachers out there to continue your spiritual practices.  Also, some of the current scientific proof for understanding the power of Spirit.
<br />You will find many upbeat stories and explanations of manifesting your destiny in these cassettes.</span>
