                    <span>i am currently subjecting myself to finance curriculum at a quant-heavy, top-5 bschool.  this text was recommended for my Intro Cap Markets class (although the prof didnt exactly use it in the class).
<br />
<br />i often used it to gain understanding of what was taught in class.  unfortunately, i found this book to be EXTREMELY painful.  it was verbose, overly complicated, hard to read, poorly organized & full of jargon.  while it is thorough in its coverage of Capital Markets & instruments, i found it to be nearly impossible to read.
<br />
<br />esoteric theories & mathematical proofs were introduced with little background, and often without insufficient detail to understand grasp.  but the jargon & vocabulary are what made the book so unreadable ... trying to read a chapter in this book would literally consume 4-5 hours of my time.
<br />
<br />AND forget about trying to use this book to do problemsets OR assignments. i could go on, but trust me, this book is bad ... UNLESS you already have a good intro & just want to use this as a reference.</span>

                    <span>If one is willing to look aside from the dry substandard humor of the author, they will find one of the best written textbooks around in any subject.  Taken as a given that some of this material is mathematically and analytically intensive, I cannot say that this entire book is easy reading.  However, you will find that the authors due an excellent job explaining and demonstrating difficult concepts.  They also provide a variety of real life examples to supplement their explanations, that help to provide context for some of the seemingly abstract concepts.  Moreover, they extensively make use of Microsoft Excel is demonstrating how to perform some complicated aspects of security analysis in a way that is easily reproducible to the reader.</span>

                    <span>This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon.</span>

                    <span>Anyone embarking upon a study of investments should begin with this book. From an explanation of market structure to intuitive analyses of all core concepts in investments (like Markowitz Theory, CAPM, Black-Scholes, Fixed Income concepts), this book has everything. Newer editions of the book also have very good instructions on how to implement the tools in MS-Excel. Obviously, this book is not meant for those pursuing a PhD. Rather it is meant for MBAs and aspiring CFAs who want to learn and implement investment tools and analysis.</span>
