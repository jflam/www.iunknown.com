                    <span>I think a novice would be at risk in using this book, whether to learn Visual Basic, to prepare for the exams, or both.<P>Prospective buyers should know right up front that this book contains several inexcusable errors. Plan a solid half hour to download the errata from the publisher's website and then mark up the corrections before beginning to read. (The publisher's errata file is by no means comprehensive, however, so you must still be on your guard--and the downloadable PDF errata file itself was so poorly formatted that the text ran irreparably past the margins, and I had to guess at the missing words of several sentences.)<P>The CDROM-based practice exams provided with the book are marginal at best, and are no substitute for the Transcender exams (which I highly recommend). Some of the questions are either dead wrong or address topics completely ignored in the book (one purveyor of the MS documentation style is enough, thank you!). The inexperienced will learn erroneous things through the exams, and experienced VB users may soon question the value of their purchase.<P>In printing the user's incorrect exam answers for review, the software behaves more like a prototype than something for commercial release (developers: don't let this happen to you!), offering the user only the default printer and no control over page margins, font size, etc. This is just one of many "little things" that could have rendered the whole book/CD package a more professional product, had it been done right.<P>Having said all of the above, there are some good aspects of the book. It provides some useful coverage of most of VB's features, and it could certainly serve as a post-exam resource or refresher. But this is almost certainly not the best book to serve that purpose.<P>I'm not sorry I bought this book, but I'm disappointed in the product which it--together with the CD--comprises. The packaging is generally more professional than the package itself, and that's a bad reflection on both author Hawhee and publisher New Riders.<P>--TW</span>

                    <span>This book is way to big to study for the exam.It does cover most of the topics related to vb and serves quite ok as a vb reference book for the basics.But for the exam go Foxall.This may help for stuff like the Treeview controls and menu bars but is too fat to digest before the exam.And yes the practice test that come with it , well they just s**k.The answers are wrong and some question's topics are not even covered in the book</span>

                    <span>I used more that this book, but I thought this was the best coverage and prep. Definitely not for beginners, does have some errors, but definitely has good excersises at the end of each chapter to make you apply and use the concept and details required... <P>As a working VB and ASP pgmr ya don't use all the features reguired to pass the test. This book does supply the complete range on knowledge required for the exam. This book, the product doc and all the practice exams you can find will get ya thru the tests...</span>

                    <span>New Riders Books are one of the most awful books You could ever find: 1) Completely useless Index<BR> ok, lets talk about this book - (besides useless index some more frustrating things):<BR>1) A lot of mistakes in (Apply your knowledge) exercises - How the heck Im going to apply it with mistakes??? and of course they most of the times refer to examples in the middle of chapters (which are small piece of code most of the time also not working)<BR>2) I threw this book garbage when in 3rd attempt trying to read ended in MTS chapter which said - "We are assuming that You are using Windows NT 4.0 Server with MTS installed"<BR> Well im using Windows XP/2000 Professional and I have no clue how to install MTS ( and believe me You dont find that in the book).<P> So everybody in their right mind - DONT BUY Easy Rider books.<P>I know I tried using one of their books for SQLServer7 exam. I passed it not because I read the book but because I had Experience in Oracle SQL language and I used Practice exams from STS</span>

                    <span>This is a pretty good reference (I still have it and use it), but it is too big for the material covered. My bookshelves are overflowing (I have gotten rid of many GOOD books) and it is frustrating when a book is good enough to keep, but the material could have fit into a space half its size. Still, one of the better VB6 references.</span>
