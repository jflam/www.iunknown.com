                    <span>This engagement calendar contains REALLY beautiful photos for every week of the year. The photos range from rocks, to water, to wildlife, to mountains. There are a few closeups of small animals, leaves, and snowflakes. The calendar has photos covering all seasons, as well. The week starts with Monday at the top of the page, and finishes with Sunday at the bottom of the page. There is plenty of room to write in appointments. Dimensions are about 7" x 9", x 1/2". The quality of the paper is lovely. I bought it for myself, and I love it.</span>

                    <span>This is the 15th year I have given my mother the Sierra Club Engagement Calendar for Christmas. I must confess I made a big mistake one year and gave her a different kind. This was NOT okay! She loves this calendar and saves every one of them. She enjoys looking back through them; it is like a walk down memory lane, "Oh, I remember when...". I am grateful that you are able to give her such enjoyment. Last, but not least, the photographs in there are awesome! Keep up the good work.</span>

                    <span>I got this for my aunt for christmas one year, just on a whim, and every year since she's always made absolutely certain that I'm getting it for her again. She loves it. The thing I like most about it is that it's got a new photo every time you flip a page... I hate the kind that only have, like, 5 pictures total in the whole thing. I suppose my only caution would be that having so many great pics leaves less room for actual writing space... so if you're one of those people who need to plan out ever last little 15 minutes of time between 6 am and midnight... this might not be best for you. ;]</span>
