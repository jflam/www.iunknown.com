                    <span>This work warns of the coming increase in the retirement population throughout the world. The baby-boom retirement will create both opportunities and challenges. The opportunities will
<br />be to grow markets to serve the new customer mix. The threats
<br />will be underfunded pension and retirement accounts.
<br />
<br />The author provides the next decade as the time to be careful financially. Although he recognizes that
<br />many investors are educated, there is a difference between school and street smart investing. The book encourages us to invest cautiously and conservatively in mutuals while diversifying to avoid excess pockets of unacceptable risks. The author encourages us to diversify and invest in real estate over the long term.
<br />This is an important work which will assist in long term planning
<br />for early retirement or mid-term corrections in the portfolio
<br />strategy to avoid catastrophic losses. The price is reasonable
<br />considering the value of the information presented.</span>

                    <span>Thank goodness President Bush learned the principles of this book!!!  This book predicts and describes all of the problems with the Social Security system, and tells you why it has to be changed.  Read it and realize that if we don't make the changes like President Bush is proposing, we could all be broke in less than 15 years!  Everyone MUST read this book to protect themselves, their families, and everything they've ever worked for.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book as well as "Rich Dad, Poor Dad". 
<br />
<br />While Kiyosaki has some valid points: financial education is woefully inadequate, it is best to avoid debt, purchase income-generating assets, there is not much else here to commend itself to the reader. 
<br />
<br />That is, unless you want to join Kiyosaki in honoring his "Rich Dad". Rich Dad is surely an entrepeneur with a lot of common sense but he is not a prophet. He may be worthy of respect, but not worship.
<br />
<br />Kiyoaki's writing style is mind-numbingly repetitive and taunting - continually hinting at the scret-he-is-about-to-reveal and never quite delivering on that promise.
<br />
<br />ERISA has influenced companies to change from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans but the real driving force is not conspiracy - it's financial: defined benefit plans are very expensive and place a tremendous fiduciary responsibility on the company. 401k plans and other defined contribution plans are less expensive to administer and put more of the financial liability on the participant, instead of the company.
<br />
<br />Now this is neither evil nor disastrous in itself. It is up to each investor to fully participate in and wisely manage their 401k plans. Just because the Baby Boomer generation will be retiring does not in and of iteself mean a meltdown in the capital markets. Although it will certainly cause some big changes!
<br />
<br />For a more complete treatment of this topic in a rational, studied manner, I recommend Harry S. Dent's work; especially the "Next Great Bubble Boom." available on amazon.com and better bookstores.

                    <span>I was browsing through the aisles in my local bookstore, when the cover of this book caught my attention.  I have watched events unfold in this country over the past 6 years which lead me to believe that America has lost any evidence of good financial sense.  And that's one of the points he makes in this book.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I thought this book could be a voice of reason which might stand out.  Its message is fairly clear, and he makes a general argument as to why the biggest stock market crash is still coming.  But the book is lacking in any kind of significant detail.  Where are the numbers?  Showing me the yearly stock market gains/losses from the 1920s is about all the detail he provides.  
<br />
<br />Instead, what this book does is scare the daylights out of you into thinking you have to buy investment real estate tomorrow, because it's the only thing that will keep you afloat in your retirement years.  And to do that successfully, the author is more than willing to tell you about his other books in the Rich Dad series, his audiotapes, his videotapes, his seminars, and his board games.  While I believe the message of the book is worthy, I disapprove of the manner in which the author uses that message to promote his other books and products.

                    <span>This book takes one, not very unique, observation that most books would cover in one chapter and stretches it out over an entire book.  Despite the title, the book offers no insight regarding how to deal with the expected "prophecy".  EXTREMELY repetitious and wriiten to a fourth grade level, you could easily skim it at the book store and get the entire message.  I have not read the other books in this series, but if they are as bad as this one, it would be a waste of time.</span>
