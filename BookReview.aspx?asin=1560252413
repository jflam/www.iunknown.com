                    <span>Ian Carr's book on Miles is complete, fairly even-handed and really tries to capture Miles as both a Musician and a budding painter and importantly as an individual. It relates the large roller coaster of Miles decade by decade at the top of his game and then coming down, getting involved with seedier elements and then somehow surviving and coming back up to ascension. Anyone who respects the Jazz genre owes it to themselves to read this book if only for the history involved, because during all the twists and turns in Jazz, especially from the Bebop era on, Miles was there, and his place as a central character is assurred, among the Jazz Greats. <p>The only reason I just gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I read Miles' own autobiography a bit later, and although he throws f-bombs throughout that book, I feel that it is still a better book because it comes from the mind of the Man himself.. This is still a great chronology, definitely worth checking out.</span>

                    <span>This was the 4th biography about Miles Davis I had read.  I guess once you read 2 or 3 biographies about a person you don't learn much new information.  Although well written I don't think this is the best account of Miles Davis life a fan could read.  I recommend Miles Davis Autobiography or Milestones before reading this one.</span>

                    <span>Describing any book as "definitive" is absurdly presumptious, especially when the subject is as well-known and widely discussed as Miles Davis. But Carr deserves to be credited with having produced a thorough and meticulous narrative of Miles' life and works. Frequently Miles' music is described to an excessively detailed degree, as if every single piece he recorded was a masterpiece. More judiciously selective analysis would have been preferable. The insights into Miles' working practices and relationships with his musicians are, however, of substantial interest to the jazz fan.</span>

                    <span>This a book for ..., the man Ian Carr is an ..., The comments he makes about western music are truly ..., I agree with the other reviews, he highlights his lack of musical knowledge when he attempts to discuss musical theory. This book is also very, very,very badly written, probably the worsed written book I've ever read. He doesn't write anything interesting about miles either.<p>Read the 'Miles Davis autobiography'  it is a thousand million times better.</span>

                    <span>As I sure has already been pointed out, this is not, as Carr claims, a definitive biography of Miles Davis.  Rather, it is simply a pretty good analysis of his musical career.  You do not come away from the book feeling like you really know who Miles Davis was.  While Carr does talk some about Miles' personal life, he does not dig too far beneath the surface, and does not provide the intimacy or the detail necessary for the reader to gain a real understanding of Miles the person.  One gets the sense that Carr would have viewed a more extensive discussion of Miles' personal life as somehow sensationalistic.  This is unfortunate, as it is difficult to fully understand the music without understanding the man.<p>As far as the musical analysis of Miles' work goes, it is quite extensive and generally pretty decent.  However, Carr does tend to be VERY opinionated about just about every major issue in jazz and this can be frustrating as he has a tendency to dismiss opinions contrary to his own as stupid or ignorant without debating the merits.  As a result, Carr often comes off as arrogant and condecending.  Also, as I believe has already been pointed out, he goes to great pains to set up what I believe to be a false dichotomy between "Western" and "Non-Western" influences in jazz.  He sees Western influences as inferior and scorns jazz musicians who incorporate too much Western influence into jazz (i.e. the cool jazz movement).  He even implies that Wynton Marsalis is somehow less of a jazz musician because his classical trumpet playing.<p>Overall, it is a useful guide to Miles' musical career, but don't expect anything close to a "definitive biography".</span>
