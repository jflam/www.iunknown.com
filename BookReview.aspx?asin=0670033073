                <span id="Label1">If contemporary fiction has one thing to teach us, it's that working for the rich and glamorous is a living hell. This simple truth has already been revealed by such books as <I>The Nanny Diaries</I> and <I>The Devil Wears Prada</I>, but for those who feel that the message bears repeating, Clare Naylor and Mimi Hare's <I>The Second Assistant: Tales from the Bottom of the Hollywood Ladder</I> offers yet another enjoyable (though fairly forgettable) lesson.<p>  The heroine of this gossipy tale is Elizabeth Miller, a young, former campaign worker for a US congressman who finds herself between employment opportunities. Unable to obtain any more socially responsible work, Lizzie is lured into the job of second assistant to an executive at a glitzy Hollywood agency. Once there, she's hit with all the "pick-up my dry cleaning," "walk my dog," "hire strippers for my party" torment that the higher-ups can dish out. At first Elizabeth is isolated, out-of-place, and underdressed in her new world, but she makes friends, builds her wardrobe, and eventually grows to care for her menial job, her Ritalin-snorting boss, and the entertainment industry in general. Finally, she reaches the conclusion that thousands of other Californians have before her: what she really wants to do is produce. At times, Lizzie seems far too na&#239;ve to survive long in the shark-infested waters that the authors describe, but there can be only one kind of ending to such a light-hearted book, so we know she will somehow muddle through. Hare (who was once a Hollywood executive herself) and Naylor throw in a dreamy guy and a few plot twists that most readers could see coming from space, stir, and serve. Of course, a little frivolity is not a bad thing, and <I>The Second Assistant</I> is certainly an entertaining addition the new underling subgenre of modern fiction. <I>--Leah Weathersby</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As other readers have noted, Second Assistant belongs to a new sub-sub-genre: the harried underling on the edge of the glamour world. So if you've read Nanny Diaries and Devil Wears Prada, you'll have a strong sense of deja vue. <P>Although both these other books were better written and more tightly plotted (i.e., no loose ends like the disappearing therapist and no look-alike glamour men who hit on the heroine), Second Assistant deserves to be read. Here the Devil isn't a person but an entire industry. Naylor and Hare give us an inside view of life in Hollywood, from the bottom up. <P>The heroine (improbably nicknamed "Lizzie") takes a second assistant job when her Washington political world falls apart. To her own surprise, she finds herself caught up in Hollywood, enjoying the life and hoping for more. She befriends a neighbor and a few equally oppressed underlings as well as the nice guy from the coffee shop, who turns out to be more Hollywood than she ever expected.<P>I gave Second Assistant three stars because I kept turning the pages. I liked the heroine's openness and admired her ability to cope with all sorts of bizarre situations without losing her dignity. And I'm amazed that she'd say yes to all sorts of requests, even from the boss's wife, but I guess that's why I never would have succeeded as a Second Assistant.<P>The saddest and truest lesson of this book. For some people, especially young attractive women, college degrees and raw intelligence will be less important than willingness to tolerate high frustration levels and creativity in carrying out a list of tasks that, at times, resembles a scavenger hunt rather than a business project.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book for many reasons. It had great story lines combining love interests and career ups and downs. Although Elizabeth Millers life couldn't be further from my own I still felt I could relate to her frankly 'too country for hollywood' ways. Excellent read.</span>

                    <span>After hearing about this book on TV, I figured it would make a great summer read, and I was right! While the book can be a bit random at times, everything comes together at the end, and had me wishing that a sequal was there waiting to be read. <P>I definitely recommend this book to anyone with Hollywood hopes or likes to know the daily office gossip at work.<P>This book made me feel sorry for Elizabeth at points - just when you thought things couldn't be better, they'd go down hill...again - but I was also laughing out loud at the various situations she managed to get into. But who couldn't when she's surrounded by as diverse a group as wackos and backstabbers?<P>But I suppose that's just Hollywood.</span>

                    <span>I don't know what to really say about this book. I'm a big fan of chick lit that dishes about the entertainment industry but the genre as a whole is becoming very stale. This book doesn't help bring in new fans. It was way too long and drawn out, the storyline was all over the place, and the pieces just didn't fit. You know how you're completing a jigsaw puzzle and you're down to the last few pieces and you try to make them fit? That's sorta what this book is like. <P>I still give the book a generous 2.5 stars because I liked the subject matter, just not the way it was written overall. I even smiled at the ending, but that could have been because I actually finished the book and not because it was clever. In my opinion, hardcover book money is too hard to come by so utilize your tax dollars and check this out of your local library.</span>
