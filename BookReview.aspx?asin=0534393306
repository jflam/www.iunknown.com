                    <span>This text, though very readable, teaches too much through example problems as opposed to actually explaining the information in the text. Presentation of some topics (chapter 6 particularly) was very poor. Some chapters were out of place (chapter 9 on differential equations, which should have been placed right before the last chapter).</span>

                    <span>Hey, this isn't a review. I just want to let you know that the people who claim that the fourth edition is the "same content" are trying to rip you off. The fourth edition is NOT the same as the fifth edition. The homework problems are NOT the same. If you get the fourth edition, you will not be able to complete your assignments for class if the instructor gives assignments out of the book.
<br />
<br />These dishonest people are just trying to get you to pay lots of money for an old edition of a textbook they can't resell at their campus bookstore anymore. If you want the fourth edition, you can get it a lot cheaper under the actual listing for the fourth edition.
<br />
<br />Don't be fooled!</span>

                    <span>Having taken 3 Calculus classes in sequence at my university with this book and having used one chapter of this book in my 4th math class that I am currently in (differential equations), I would say that I've used most of this book.  Let's just say that this book needs a professor to go along with it.  There's really not much of a chance, unless you're really smart, that you can only use this book with no other study aids and understand all of the concepts presented.  This book really is made for your math professor to more fully explain.  Having said that, I must add that the CD-ROM enclosed is GREAT.  I guess if you don't have your professor to go over the finer details of some of the more vague concepts, then this is the next best thing.  The sounds-like-a-grad-student voice that explains each chapter in great detail is easy to understand and makes most concepts pretty clear.  I have to say that this CD-ROM is saving me on my midterm.</span>

                    <span>This was the book that I had for my first year calculus course.<br>It was amazing how much detail they put in.<br>Everytime time that I didn't understand something(such as where it was derived from, when it would be used), the book had a detailed explanations and/or proofs to accompany it.<br>This is probably the only textbook that I own that has never had a problem/theory/proof etc. that made me go "Where the heck did that come from?", or "How come I can't seem to apply it to any question that is supposed to be solved using it?".<p>In short, if you're like me and like detailed explanations on everything, you'll be very satisfied with this book.<p>If y = 5x, I give it y' thumbs up.</span>

                    <span>This is the early transcendentals version of Stewart's calculus. The title of the book is quite appropriate, in that to learn calculus well, one must transcend the Stewart approach early and often. I found my self reading another text (Simmon's Calculus and Analytic Geometry) as an antidote to this dry, disjointed, lifeless tome. <p> Stewart takes an inconsistent (sometimes rigorous, sometimes intuitive) approach toward teaching the calculus. It seems as if he has attempted to be all things to all people. Though he may have attempted to present the subject in both an intuitive (to motivate the typical student) and rigorous (to satisfy the professor) manner, he failed to deliver on either. <br> <br> The text is replete with pretty diagrams and some historical diversions, which read as canned, trivial snippets. In spite of this eye candy, the mathematical exposition is poor. Most proofs read as shorthand notes to one who already understands the subject. Is it analysis or basic calculus? Stewart seems to have a schizophrenic writing manner. On the one hand, he presents examples in "workbook" (i.e. Schaum's outline) form, so that if one wishes to solve a particular sort of problem, one might find it here. On the other hand, he does not seem able to meld problem solving with rigor in a coherent manner. So an abbreviated proof is done, with several relevant steps (relevant, that is, to the beginner) omitted. What function does this serve for a pre-analysis student? A proof that might take 10 steps is presented in 4. What is the point of this approach? Perhaps so as to ward off accusations that a particular subject was not touched upon. <p>The book is expensive and bloated. Though the "official" rendering of the page numbers is 781, there are approximately 130 other pages devoted to appendices (some as advertisements for other, i.e. ancillary, materials). Note, this text is intended for a 2 semester Calculus sequence. It seems inappropriate, perhaps fraudulent, that Stewart devoted 900+ expensive pages for his task, and yet failed to present the material in an interesting and efficient manner.  Given his insistence upon this secondary material, I ask Stewart - did you ever intend for this book to be relatively self-contained for the serious first year scholar, or did you expect the professor or CD-ROM to fill in the gaps in your exposition?  Some alternative texts:  Simmons, Anton, Stein, Thomas/Finney.</span>
