                    <span>Generally this is a good book.  It covers some algorithm to the depth.  But many topics it covers are not useful to game development, which I am interested.  It does not cover some important animation related topics like vertex blending.</span>

                    <span>AART is all in all a good book. It covers many graphics related topics and is very interesting reading although some of the topics are not all that relevant for modern 3D hardware accelerated computers.<p>The book is divided into 3 parts:<p>The first part is an ultra compact summary of the computer graphics needed to understand the rest of the book. This part is virtually impossible to understand for people new to graphics - so I recommend reading Foley, et al: Computer Graphics - Principles and Practice first.<p>The second part covers rendering and is an introduction to shadows, mapping, ray tracing and radiosity. <p>The third part covers animation techniques such as bones and blending.<p>The book tries to cover as many things as possible and the consequence is, at times, that it does not use enough space on some things to make them comprehendable. I guess, this is probably only intended as a survey of alternative techniques and references to the original articles are given for interested readers.<p>Finally, the book contains a fair number of errors (one every couple of pages) many of which is in vital equations. There has been no corrections done to the book since its original release in 1992 and the official errata isn't good either. <p>For the sake of other readers I have therefore compiled an unofficial errata list for the book and I recommend that all readers take a look at it. Find it by searching for "watt errata" on Google.</span>

                    <span>This book is the one I learned the fundimentals of the computer graphics from. It covers most of the computer graphics subjects and explains them in a quite easy-to-follow way. If you want to learn computer graphics, this book is a very nice starting point. Most of the chapters do not give the implementation details but in my opinion this is a nice thing since helps the understanding the theory and the concepts.<p>It covers: Parametric modelling, Antialising, Shadows, Mapping, Procedural textures, Ray Tracing, Radiocity, Global Illimunation, Volume rendering, Hierarchic animation, soft body animation and procedural animation subjects.</span>
