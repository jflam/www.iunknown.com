Not only did I use it to get the perfect job for myself, but I also used it to get a raise and a promotion a short while later. Don't let the small size of the book discourage you. Believe me, this book is packed with everything you'll need for success. Buy this book! You won't be sorry.</span>

                    <span>This is a clear, useful guide with a lot of original points.  Not a lot of silly emphasis on superficial aspects of interviewing.  It's also easy to read and digest. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>another strong-titled, very popular book that has watered down content and is so devoid of meaty substance as to make one instantly consider utilizing the pages for rolling papers.<p>A lot of words on the cover - not enough inside!</span>

                    <span>I think anybody who gets nervous in job interviews should read this book and do the preparation exercises it recommends.  It's different from any other job interview book I've ever seen, in a good way.  It's a real, step-by-step process for getting better at it, which was exactly what I personally needed.  I haven't tried it out in a real interview yet, but I feel a heck of a lot more ready to do the one I have scheduled for next week, because I look at the whole thing in a whole new way now.  If you get nervous in interviews, you should read this book because it will give you things to think about that will take your mind off of your nervousness.  It's not about acting in a fake way at all.  It's more about how to "act" in the best possible way in any interview scenario.  If you do what this book says, you'll feel really PREPARED for whatever they throw at you.  And it's actually funny and enjoyable to read.</span>

                    <span>I've been on the dole now for about 3 years now. If one wishes to maintain a lifestyle that one has become accustomed to one must stay informed. That is why I highly recommend this book. <p>Part of the requirement of being able to continue collecting unemployment benefits is maintaining the illusion of trying to find a job. The Interview Rehearsal Book is a great tool in that it teaches acting skills to achieve your goal.<p>Using techniques in this book I have learned to play "The incompetent", "The compulsive liar", "The slacker", "The insubordinate" and many other such roles.<p>If you wish to continue to be able to sleep 10 hours a day, watch daytime TV and generally do anything that you want you must work at it. Freedom is something we must always be willing to make sacrifices for. So where as the few dollars you spend on this book might deplete your beer money, it is a minimal short term price to pay to maintain your long term goal. Sure I had to miss a few episodes of Jerry Springer to read this book and practice my craft but it is time well spent.<p>You may say: Hey but I don't want to learn to "act" to be something I am not. Well to that I say you are learning to act to be what you are, which is unemployable. Ethics and morality are all well and good for used car salesmen or the folks at Enron but when living in the real world one must learn to develop their own code of conduct. Forget about who you think you are and learn to be what a potential employer does not want in an employee. Unemployment statistics are at an all time low so you must get an edge and this book will give you a virtual razor to cut any potential ties to the day to day working grind.<p>So read this and be the best that you can be!</span>
