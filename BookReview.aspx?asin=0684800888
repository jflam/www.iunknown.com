                    <span>For anyone who has ever been interested in baseball's Hall of Fame, from being a serious historian of the game to simply being a fan who wanted your favorite player to be honored, this book will teach you a great deal. <P>Bill James, in a very entertaining style, will show you how some of the game's greatest players have been overlooked for the game's highest honor, while lesser men have been awarded. He will show you the passion of those who promote a certain player for election, while also demonstrating how illogical many can be as they argue for their favorites. He shows the inconsistency of the various voting bodies, the chronyism, the politics, and most other aspects of the long history of the Hall of Fame's process for determining the game's greatest players. It is a subject not often outlined in this depth, and James does a splendid job with it.<P>There are some flaws. James, as he often does, contradicts his own previously stated views on some players, and does so without explanation, which can be maddening to anyone who has read most of his work. He also has the unnecessary habit of insulting people for no real reason. As a man who can write so well and express his views in such detail and with such clarity, it doesn't appear to be necessary, when citing an example of one fan's opinion about Mickey Lolich, to answer this question:<P>"Am I the only baseball fan who feels that statistics provide, at best, a meager measure of a player's worth?"<P>with this answer:<P>"Well, no, Mr. Miedlar, actually, there are an amazing number of idiots in the world."<P>Stooping to that level is entertaining at times, but it also serves to convince the reader that James is a bit full of himself, and a bit of a bully to boot.<P>Still, those flaws are minor when compared to the overall quality of both the information presented and the manner in which James presents it. Anyone with an interest in baseball in general, or baseball history or the Hall of Fame in particular, will be pleased with what they find in this book.</span>

                    <span>Terrific book by baseball's best author. James pulls no punches in ripping the Hall of Fame for some very poor selections. He introduces several new concepts such as the Black-Ink test. As a Cub fan, I appreciate his advocacy of Ron Santo's selection to the Hall. As good as the book was, though, I couldn't give it the 5 star rating. James spends way too much time debating Phil Rizzuto's merits; Rizzuto v. Reese, Rizzuto v. Stephens Rizzuto v.Jerry Priddy (?), etc.. Nonetheless it is a great book and well worth buying.</span>

                    <span>This is where Bill James tries to convince us that he knows more about baseball in the twenties and thirties than Frankie Frisch. Through half truths, a ruthless manipulation of statistics and delusional statements revealing his souless mathematical vision of baseball, James basically carries on a campaign of petty character assassination against many of the people in the Hall and those who put them there. That so many baseball fans would rather believe a statistically obsessed nerd who never saw the players he evaluates rather than a great athlete like Frisch who actually played with and against the men he helped put in the hall is very disappointing. I can tell you that people who actually work in baseball think of James as somewhat of a joke. Others, like me, are not amused. It would be a very sad day if entrance into the Hall was controlled by opinionated statiticians like James rather than people who actually understand the game.</span>

                    <span>Talk about an interesting baseball book. Bill James has outdone himself with this one. No, Phil Rizzuto does not belong in the Hall of Fame! But neither do a lot of other guys, so we might as well leave them in. It's all politics anyway. Just get a good lobbyist like Frankie Frisch on your side. This is why baseball is so great. In what other sport would so many people care about who is in the Hall of Fame?</span>

                    <span>After reading "Politics of Glory" I would like to nominate Bill James for Hot Stove League Commissioner. The Hot Stove League is where baseball hungry fans spend their winter days arguing that "My favorite player is better than yours!" James approaches baseball arguments the way a Philadelphia lawyer evaluates lucrative contracts, by examining every point with microscopic clarity.<P>A book about the Hall of Fame, with its unending controversies over just who is truly deserving of entry and who is not, is ideal grist for the analytical mind of James. He covers many controversies, two of which surround Dodger pitcher Don Drysdale and Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto. Drysdale had been voted into the Hall by the time James wrote his book while Rizzuto was elected just as James was completing his final chapter. The evaluations of both players were so thorough that James concluded his analysis of Drysdale by covering the tall right-hander's performance in pennant stretch drives of the Dodgers as well as in the twelve games James deemed the most crucial of his career excluding World Series performances. Rizzuto's Hall of Fame worthiness was ultimately evaluated by a statistically microscopic comparison of the Yankee star with his counterpart New York contemporary at shortstop, Pee Wee Reese of the Brooklyn Dodgers.<P>In addition to comparing and contrasting players both in and out of the Hall, James also delves into the politics of Cooperstown. He decries the period of the fifties and sixties for what he deems less than deserving choices made by the Veterans Committee. James pinpoints the reason as the leadership influence of Frankie Frisch, the great infielder of the Cardinals and Giants, whose love affair with the game of his playing days continued even when he was managing teams years later. James notes that the "Fordham Flash" was less than a hit with his players for constantly proclaiming that "The players of my days were much better than the players now." Frisch's period on the Veterans Committee resulted in numerous former teammates being selected, including choices James statistically debunks as inadequate, including three former St. Louis Cardinals, pitcher Jess Haines, first baseman Jim Bottomly, and outfielder Chick Hafey.<P>Reading James improves a baseball fan's instincts for looking beyond the sheer numbers, such as park advantages, i.e.: Did a pitcher perform in a home park favorable to pitchers or hitters or did a hitter play half his games in a stadium with short or long fences? James comes up with some convincing arguments by searching in places where most fans have never treaded.</span>
