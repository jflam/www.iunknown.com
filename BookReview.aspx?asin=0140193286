                    <span>very challenging, stimulating and ultimately satisfying dialogue that nicely coalesces with the seminal works of such great writers as Alan Watts, Fritjof Capra and Robert Anton Wilson.<p>The science versus spirituality "conflict" dissipates into thin air with each elegantly written page of this wonderful book.</span>

                    <span>Talbot opens the book with an introduction that gives the reader some idea of where he's going.  The first several chapters lay down a quick ground work, introducing the reader to the old physics' universal precepts.  He then goes into what new areas of quantum research are uncovering and postulating, and ties it in with mostly eastern mystical thought: Tantra, Buddhism, and the in-betweens.  He makes references to specific cases, specific theories, and specific thinkers, past and present.  The work is overall well written and well cited, very coherent and unesoteric.  I recommend the book to anyone looking for an explaination for what they can't explain and who is not satisfied with occidental mythoi.</span>

                    <span>this book likes to do the same thing over and over again. tell you about some bizarre concept that mystics have had for thousands of years, and then tell you that the new physics backs up those concepts. you keep thinking, 'maybe this time physics will be completely at odds with this bizarre  concept.' but no. so as you can see it gets kind of predictable. but maybe  ive given away too much. oh well, i might as well tell you a little more  while im at it. none of this is real. so why does it seem real? what  exactly is it that seems real but in reality is not? what is real if  anything? and what is it that thinks its perceiving reality? and this  process of thinking, is it real? and this word process, is it valid? or  does its implication that time is passing destroy its validity? all these  questions are raised, answered, explained why they are not valid questions  and then dismissed. TRUTHTRUTHTRUTHTRUTHTRUTHTRUTHTRUTH. read up children.  youll either find new wonders all around you or kill yourself or turn into  pure energy.</span>

                    <span>A truly amazing book. although i found this book a little hard to understand but once i got used to the language i found it very interesting. It says "world is an illusion' and through different philisophical and  physical phenomenon has proven it to be correct ( atleast to me). a really  good bokk the reader has to wear the writers shoes in order to understand  it and enjoy it to its fullest</span>
