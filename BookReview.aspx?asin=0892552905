<br />Anyway, I had to read this book this year for American History and I have to say that it was just God Awful. This is some of the most hackneyed reading I have ever seen. Not only are the characters ridiculously boring, but the story is just plain bad. Everything that you would expect to go wrong does, everytime things start to look up, something goes wrong. The metaphors used in this book also sound like the first attempts a 3rd grader trying to use metaphors. Not only is it bad, but Yezierska is just plain inconsistent with her characters.

<br />After his first wife dies, Reb remarries but his new wife is just after him for the money. When sleeping at his house, his daughter hears his new wife trying to get the still weak Reb to sign over his inheritence to her. The daughter quickly gets up and yells at the new wife. The next day though, the wife is now helping the husband put on his clothes and is asssisting around the house and the daughter realizes that he is dependent upon his new wife. There is no explanation for her sudden change of heart, it just happens. Then the daughter makes some food for the new wife who in return makes apple struedel for her and then they become the best of friends. The whole novel is like this with it's stupidity and inconsistency. Even our teacher said that its a pretty bad book, but that we read it because its a first hand account. Please, dont think this book is worth getting, it's really just a horrible piece of recycled trash you've heard a thousand times.</span>

                    <span>Often when in such a class, European immigrants are not thought of as having as much of a struggle. This book about an East. European family is very heart-wrenching and interesting.</span>

                    <span>My name is Bessie Hurwitz, and I read this book in my 6th grade LA class.This book is deep and touching. It is told though the youngest of the Smolinsky daughters, Sara. The father is a preaching tyrant. He cannot make a living, but sits and prays all day, saying the woman is the curse, and blames his daughters for his mistakes. Sara runs away and tries to survive in the world by getting a college education. This story paints life for immagrants in New York during the early 1900's. Sara tells about how she feels about life.  I can really enter her world. It is not a light read, but it is worth your while. The ending seems disapointing, but I don't want to ruin it for you. It's one of the books that you'll never forget about.</span>

                    <span>I started this book with the mentality that this was just going to be another one of those immigrant accounts where the characters tell their rags to riches story. I wasn't wrong, but the book held so much more. I would probably categorize this more as a feminist book since gender is such an issue. <p>The main character, Sara Smolinsky, narrates the story of her family and their experience in living in perpetual poverty in early twentieth century New York. Her father, an Orthodox Russina/Polish Jew, spends his days studying the Torah so that he can bring 'light' to the world, while his daughters and wife take sole responsibility as being the burdern bearers. He adds further distress to their lives by arranging loveless and grim marriages for each of his daughters. Only his youngest, Sara, doesn't let him ruin her life, but rather sets out to make something of herself on her own terms. Also, the fact that both Sara and her father's lives are so intwined gives the lesson that no matter how far a person goes, they really can't escape thier past, as Sara tried to, but for her feelings of guilt could not.  <p>Overall the book displays various insights to the condition of the 20th century immigrant and displays how far the Old World really is from the New World. Most importantly, it shows that with the proper dose of good sense and courage, one can truly transform their life.</span>

                    <span>I read this for my history of childhood course (I'm a history major) and this was a fascinating read into the life of a Jewish immigrant from Eastern Europe.  She learns to find her own happiness after watching her father arrange marriages for her three sisters to men they don't love.  After every chapter, I felt like going into the book and just screaming at Sara's pious, lazy Orthodox Jewish father who does nothing but study his Holy Torah.  This book should be required reading not just in colleges but in high schools, too.</span>
