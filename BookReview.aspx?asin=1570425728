                <span id="Label1">These 11 historic sermons--some complete recordings of entire addresses, others reconstructed from various church services--make plain why Martin Luther King Jr. considered his "first calling and greatest commitment" to be a preacher of the gospel. As an orator he is second to none, drawing his audience in with an urgency that resonates through every soaring cadence of his familiar, powerful voice. Using insights from psychology, philosophy, and the Bible, he appeals to the heads as well as the hearts of his congregations, explaining that personal and social change can only be effected by adopting a morality of love in service of God and humankind. While King's concern for social justice is a common theme throughout, each sermon is a jewel of literary artistry, as it presents a simple problem, examines its complications, and offers a startling and often challenging resolution. Topics range from "Rediscovering Lost Values," a caution that scientific progress without moral progress can result only in a step backward for humanity, to "An American Dream," a wake-up call to the "self-evident truth" of equality proclaimed in the Constitution.<p> Brief introductions to the sermons from spiritual leaders and friends, including Dr. Joan Campbell, Billy Graham, Dr. Robert Franklin, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, offer personal insights into King's life, work, and legacy. An interesting note from the producers explains how the recordings of the sermons (published in a hardcover companion of the same name) were pieced together. In word and in voice, these are masterpieces of theological literature from one of the world's great orators, who Robert Franklin rightly says may well be "the greatest religious intellectual of the twentieth century."

                    <span>Simply phenomenal added dimension of Dr king that the general public who know him as an inspired civil rights leader must come to know. He was nspired, energized and directed by the word of Almighty God and conscience. Oh for leaders today to be likewise constituted.</span>

                    <span>The sermons in A Knock at Midnight are both deeply moving and a powerful reminder of the greatness of Dr. King.  This collection should be read and heard by everyone, especially the young of today who have been fed a Dr. King who somehow only delivered one speech ("I Have a Dream").  As a middle school teacher I found the sermons to be an excellent way for my students to move beyond the platitudes about Dr. King to a much deeper understanding of his life and ministry.  To read and listen to these great sermons is an absolutely wonderful experience, but at the same time a sad reminder that today we have no great voice of moral authority like his.  Fortunately we do have his words and voice preserved for us and our children.</span>

                    <span>Notice I refer to the cassettes and the companion book as an EXPERIENCE as I both listened to and read the REVEREND King! Although the media focused on the visible part of his ministry, the civil rights movement, his sermons  are profound and awesome in their implications for today as well as their  in their powerful delivery during the mid-1950's through 1960's. Although I  will cherish both the cassette series and the book, it is through hearing  the SPEAKING of Dr. King that really made me breathless! Thank you LORD God  for sending us your messenger Dr. King to give us a wonderful earthly  ministry for a brilliant and brief time (much like Jesus Christ). Simply  awesome!</span>

                    <span>A fabulous collection of soul-stirring preaching by one of this century's finest preachers. Many people know King as a great political leader, fiery orator, and creative organizer. This collection of sermons will convince  the world that King was first and foremost an anointed preacher. His  sermons ring with authenticity and resound with relevancy. Kings messages  speak profoundly to our troubled times and offer both prophetic insight and  divine guidance as we attempt to find our way into the next millinium. This  collection of sermons, with their superb introductions and commentaries, is  perhaps one of the finest efforts of its kind. It will certainly be a  source of pleasure and insight for generations to come.</span>

                    <span>A Knock At Midnight is frightfully prophetic,subperbly truthful and dynamically inspiring.It shows what the great mind of King brings and brought to the forefront while he was living and while he continues to live  in our hearts.These sermons are chillingly lifelike as if King speaks  directly to your heart and mind---NOW! It is truly a must read! The sermon  A Knock at Midnight delivers the powerful and sensitive message concerning  where the Church has to take the people as far as their needs are concerned  and it deals with the advocacy of having to open the door to the truly  oppressed and needy.It is a thought provoking  theme set against the veil  of modern times.There is a a Knock At Midnight and it is now answering the  world.</span>
