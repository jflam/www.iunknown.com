Journey behind embassy walls and closed doors to learn what drives these ambassadors to a life of conquest and compromise, danger and even deception.

                    <span>Don't waste your time on this garbage, I didn't remotely learn anything from this DVD. There's some clips of the ambassador's to Japan, Pakistan & Guatemala, and it says that people go to the embassy to get a VISA to get into the US. Basic, basic information. No one should waste thier time with this garbage. It wasn't worth a second of my time, yet alone an hour of my time. Save yourself, and don't see this.</span>

                    <span>This DVD was a good brief look at life "inside the Embassy." I probably would have given it five stars, but as a possible future Foreign Service Officer I would have liked to hear more about the Foreign Service itself!<P>This documentary gives a brief overview at the ambassadors in Pakistan, Guatamala, and Japan as well as talking about the bombing in Kenya (as the current Guatamalan ambassador was ambassador there when the bombing occurred). They also showed the intensely personal debate between family and service (the Pakistan Ambassador's 14-year-old daughter asked her to give up the position to be with her family, which she did).<P>One of the points I found most interesting was the ambassador in Japan's visit to a memorial service for fishery students killed on the Ehime-maru when a US Naval submarine collided with it and how much that incident affected US-Japanese relations. It was a wake-up call to me that something that most Americans considered so minor was a fairly major international incident. I was teaching high school at the time and don't even remember it being on the "news" they showed students daily. <P>Since most Americans rarely even think about how important Ambassadors (as well as the whole US Foreign Service) are to the safety of our country, I thought this documentary was very well done and important. I also thought most people would find this interesting, even those that are not usually documentary watchers (for instance, I passed this one on to my mom).</span>
