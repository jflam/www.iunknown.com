                <span id="Label1"><P> "Have mercy on me, Lord, I am Cuban." In 1962, Carlos Eire was one of 14,000 children airlifted out of Cuba -- exiled from his family, his country, and his own childhood by the revolution. The memories of Carlos's life in Havana, cut short when he was just eleven years old, are at the heart of this stunning, evocative, and unforgettable memoir.  <P> <I>Waiting for Snow in Havana</I> is both an exorcism and an ode to a paradise lost. For the Cuba of Carlos's youth -- with its lizards and turquoise seas and sun-drenched siestas -- becomes an island of condemnation once a cigar-smoking guerrilla named Fidel Castro ousts President Batista on January 1, 1959. Suddenly the music in the streets sounds like gunfire. Christmas is made illegal, political dissent leads to imprisonment, and too many of Carlos's friends are leaving Cuba for a place as far away and unthinkable as the United States. Carlos will end up there, too, and fulfill his mother's dreams by becoming a modern American man -- even if his soul remains in the country he left behind. <P> Narrated with the urgency of a confession, <I>Waiting for Snow in Havana</I> is a eulogy for a native land and a loving testament to the collective spirit of Cubans everywhere.</span>

                    <span>Carlos Eire has created a memorable record of his childhood in Havana writng beautifully of his lovely surroundings populated by colorful characters, many of them related to him. The shadow of impending doom in the shape of Fidel's revolution slowly but relentlessly advances over this idylic scene and ultimately results in his secure world and his family being torn apart.<BR>This book brilliantly combines a distinctly Cuban coming of age tale with a view into Cuba at the time of the revolution as experienced through the eyes of a comfortable middle class child.<BR>Eire's writing is so evocative of the feelings he associates with the various episodes in his early life that the reader is drawn into his experience in a very visceral way.<BR>I thought this book was beautifully written and at times emotionally wrenching. A wonderful eye-opening read . Highest reccomendation.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book ostensibly is a memoir about the author's last few years as a child in Cuba, before being airlifted, without his parents, to the US in 1962 as part of the infamous Operation Pedro (Peter) Pan, and also about his initially very difficult adaptation to life in the US. But as the reader peels back layer after layer of Professor Eire's story, he soon realizes that it is far, far more than a memoir. It is a novel-like tour of both life's mysteries and life's little details as seen through the eyes of a child, in this case made far more poignant because of the author's particular life circumstances. Professor Nieto Eire weaves a special kind of historical/spiritual tapestry, recounting real events through use of natural and religious imagery to give the reader not just a sense for what physically happened to him and his loved ones, but also what happened to him spiritually and intellectually, when Fidel Castro elected in 1959 to imprison the Cuban soul. This book is high (very high) literature indeed, and what I most enjoyed about it is its ability, in the space of any five pages, to evoke from the reader a wide range of emotions; from joy to sadness, from laughter to tears, from dread to relief. Through it all, the reader develops an understanding for the uniquely Cuban experience, and also for how special a person Carlos Eire must be.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a misty-eyed memoir of an egoistical man who had a very privileged childhood. Because that idealized world was sundered, he believes he has a deeper take on suffering and displacement and he asks the reader to sympathize with his plight and along the way, to blame it all on Castro. The writing is precious, almost cloyingly so--one would expect a historian to be more careful of his language. If the Cuba he remembers is a paradise lost, then he needs to move on. Cuba has survived well enough without him.</span>

                    <span>Having left Cuba as a young girl of 10, I lived through what he shares in the book. His story is told with sentiment and true emotion, as only one can tell it having lived through it. I hope Mr. Eire keeps on writing books such as this.</span>

                    <span>Very beautiful and as lyrical as one can possible get, "Waiting for Snow in Havana" embraces with equal fervor, both the beauty and innocence of childhood with its laughter, pranks and endless fascinations with lizards and the heartbreaking tragedy and the ensuing political upheaval that would eventually destroy it all. I'll admit that Mr. Eire is occasionally prone to fits of self-indulgence, rambling endlessly about trivialities and the collaboration of a sympathetic editor didn't help matters, but this is ultimately a gorgeous and haunting memoir that should be read by anyone interested in the Diaspora, Cuban or otherwise. The humorous segments are laugh out loud funny (especially if you, like me, are Cuban and can relate to the quirkiness that is inherent to the Cuban temperament) and the sorrowful ones were enough to bring tears to my eyes. The pages are seemingly perfumed with a palpable sense of longing yet eternal optimism lends its unmistakable scent to the heady brew. To those directly affected by the Cuban revolution, Operation Pedro Pan and/or endless exile, this beautifully rendered chronicle will bring back many wonderful, if equally painful memories and to those fortunate enough to have been spared those sorrows, it is my fervent hope that it will serve as insight into the beauty and warmth of the Cuban people and our much cherished culture.</span>
