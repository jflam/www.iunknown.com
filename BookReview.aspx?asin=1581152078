                    <span>I'm called a veteran photographer these days, but I learned a lot from the newest edition of this book. It's easy to forget expenses when estimating or billing, and the book shows you how to avoid such pitfalls. There are many new stock uses relating to the web etc. and I now have a basis for pricing such uses. If you are starting out, read the book carefully, it's as good an introduction to the business end of photography -- that is of course about making money -- as you will get. If you know a photo student, give it to him or her as a graduation present. Highly reccommended.</span>

                    <span>I'm a professional photographer so I have experience in pricing, but until I read this book I didn't realize how much more there was to learn. I have picked up a lot of subtleties in negotiating techniques which has given me increased confidence in dealing with clients. Another plus for me was the language rights section. By using the careful, precise language when writing an invoice I am now avoiding some pitfalls in the permissions I grant to clients. The pricing charts are a great reference so I can see where my rates fall in comparison to the national average. Sometimes I even show the price charts to my clients so they can see what a good deal I'm giving them! The book is a gold mine of information -- all spelled out in photographer-friendly language.</span>

                    <span>"Pricing Photography" is the perfect book to take the mystery out of charging for your photo assignments and stock sales. As a staff photographer for a university, I know my photography techniques. However, I have been wanting to branch out into some commercial jobs without being sure how to handle the business and pricing aspects. This book opened my eyes.<P>The tips on negotiating really remove the intimidation of talking money with a client. The price charts are helpful, but it's the advice that makes the book such a boon for me -- it is friendly, practical and usable.</span>

                    <span>When I bought this book, I was looking for info on how to price a photo assignment for sale. The title and short abstract of the book led me to believe this would be a great reference for my purposes. However, when I got the book, the first few paragraphs pointed out that its focus was on assignment stock photography, not for pricing photo assignments in which the finished prints are to be sold to individual clients. If I were submitting stock photos to publishers, it would be a great reference for me. It gets 2 stars only because it didn't suit my purposes at the time.</span>
