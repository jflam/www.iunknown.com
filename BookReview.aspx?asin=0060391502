                    <span>I found this book in a thrift store for $2, after hearing about it from an ex girlfriend.  It takes a while to figure it out, but after like 2 weeks I mastered it.   People who have problems understanding this, just are't trying hard enough.  Anyway , I lost 20 pounds, and I'm at my ideal weight now.  All this with barely working out.   I have more energy throughout the day, and more importantly, a lot more confidence.  There is sacrifice involved, but once you get to where I am, you really can't see living any other way.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I Lost 42lbs. in three months on the zone, but a person must not get out of the zone or the weight comes back! so if you want to lose, stay with the zone forever!
<br />
<br />This is a really interesting book about how eating affects our health. There is a lot of useful information in here to provide much thought about what to eat. There are also interesting references for wellness products. 
<br />
<br />The author does suggest you go off coffee slowly before you start the plan. This would minimize headaches during detox. I couldn't wait to get started so, of course, did it all at once and had the most horrible awful headache for 4 straight days. I finally broke down and had a 1/2 cup coffee one day instead of taking aspirin and that did the trick...for the moment. Now I'm completely caffeine-free and don't miss it at all. 
<br />
<br />My doctor prescribed a wonderful replacement for coffee made from soya beans called "soyffee". I bought it online at www. S o y c o f f e e.com and cannot believe how good is the taste.</span>

                    <span>Are we all reading the same book?
<br /> 
<br /> Dr. Sears DOES base his work largely aournd the glycemic index! So much so that there's an entire chapter early in the book discussing nothing but the glycemic index, where foods lie on it and how to mange your personal glucose levels.
<br /> 
<br /> Sears began his reseach over 30 years ago when his male relatives were suffering from heart problems at young ages. He realized his fate, and didn't want to go the same way. He doesn't simply propose a "diet", and if you are looking for a diet rather than an understanding of biology, then this won't be helpful.
<br /> 
<br /> Sears managed the diets of Olympic and college athletes and teams over the years, developing an understanding of what it takes to enable a body to perform at it's peak. Realizing that everyone is different, his advice is to understand the systems and then provide the appropriate nutrition.
<br /> 
<br /> If you want to understand what each type of food provides from a nutritional standpoint, then to develop an approach that is specific to your life, Sears provides an education about what you're really eating and a simpler way of choosing foods.</span>

                    <span>"The Zone" is a good instructional manual for people who have extremely poor diets, but for the average person with a modicum of common sense, it's quite useless. This is the first diet "manual" I've read and no doubt it will be my last.  I picked up a lot of good information reading "The Zone," and indeed, I did loose three pounds in about three weeks.  Many of the recipes are tasty - if you have an hour to cut up eight cups of fresh broccolli, that is.  But counting out the various "blocks" took an inordinate amount of time and energy from my already busy schedule.  Once I replaced the time I spent planning Zone menus, grocery shopping, prepping my meals, and other minutiae with daily cardio exercise, *that's* when I started to notice results!  Now I just follow a simple routine of limiting my caloric intake.  One thing that was very misleading about "The Zone" is that the authors claim that the dieter should not feel hungry.  Not so.  Make no mistake:  this diet hinges on portion control and calorie counting, and I, like many people I know who are on the Zone diet, was famished beyond belief, particularly during the first two weeks. Bottom line is, if one is healthy and fit, nixing carbs from your diet doesn't matter, 'cause ultimately, it's about how many calories you put in your body and how many you work off.</span>

                    <span>First of all, it's not for everyone.  No diet is, I suspect.  If you hate having to keep track of portions or if you freak out about the fact that all the recipes are "4 block" but you need a "3 block" meal and you don't like to multiply the amounts by 3/4, you will hate this diet.  Save your money and try something else. <br>I'm a 35 year old woman.  I've been on the Zone for about 2 months.  I've lost 20 lbs (all of it fat), my blood pressure has dropped and I feel great and have lots of energy.  For the last 5 years I've been struggling with excess weight that I couldn't lose with a combination of exercise and (mostly unsuccessful)attempts to eat less.  I was kind of dubious at first about the Zone, but it has done wonders in terms of helping me eat sensibly without getting hungry between meals.  My skin looks a lot nicer as well.<br>There are many misconceptions about the Zone.  It's not Atkins, it's not South Beach (although they do share some similarities), and it's not a magic diet in which you eat unlimited amounts of food.  (And in response to the previous reviewer, glycemic index is mentioned many times in the book.)  <br>It is a portion control diet.  You will need to eat appropriate amounts of protein, carbs and fat at every meal.  It seems weird at first. It takes work.  You will need to do more food preparation than before, or at the very least you will have to learn about portion sizes. Exercise is strongly recommended.  You will probably be consuming fewer calories than before unless you were already on a very low calorie diet. Yes, you lose weight because you eat less, same as any other diet.  (I never understood why some reviewers seem to think that this is a bad thing) If you do it right, however, you will be eating quite a lot of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein sources.  It is not difficult to stay in the Zone when you go out to eat.  You probably won't get the Atkins bad breath or constipation.  Yes, it's a bit of a pain keeping track of amounts, but it's not really that different from counting carb grams or fat grams.  And once you know the amounts, you really don't have to do much measuring.  <br>I have to admit I'm not a big fan of the recipes in the book, so usually I just find appropriate recipes in other cookbooks or cook without recipes.  There are a lot of good low fat, low carb meat recipes - all you have to do is add enough fruits and vegetables and you have a good meal without the annoying 'everything mixed together' aspect of some of the book recipes</span>
