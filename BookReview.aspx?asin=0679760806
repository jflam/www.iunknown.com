                <span id="Label1">Mikhail Bulgakov's devastating satire of Soviet life was written during the darkest period of Stalin's regime.  Combining two distinct yet interwoven parts-one set in ancient Jerusalem, one in contemporary Moscow-the novel veers from moods of wild theatricality with violent storms, vampire attacks, and a Satanic ball; to such somber scenes as the meeting of Pilate and Yeshua, and the murder of Judas in the moonlit garden of Gethsemane; to the substanceless, circus-like reality of Moscow. Its central characters, Woland (Satan) and his retinue-including the vodka-drinking, black cat, Behemoth; the poet, Ivan Homeless; Pontius Pilate; and a writer known only as The Master, and his passionate companion, Margarita-exist in a world that blends fantasy and chilling realism, an artful collage of grostesqueries, dark comedy, and timeless ethical questions.<br><br> Although completed in 1940, <i>The Master and Margarita</i> was not published in Moscow until 1966, when the first part appeared in the magazine <i>Moskva</i>. It was an immediate and enduring success: Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to its expression of artistic and spiritual freedom. This new translation has been created from the complete and unabridged Russian texts.</span>

                    <span>The supernatural Woland, Azazello, Koroview and the black anthropomorphic cat Behemoth visit Moscow in the 1930s, creating a series of paranormal events that leave the reader reeling with laughter and shock. The supernatural powers play with human pawns (sometimes aided by the "evil" human inclination) to comical and sometimes tragic ends. The supernatural forces are omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent. The humans are duped into seeing what does not exist, teleported to Yalta, intimidated, assaulted, turned into ghouls (against their will), they strike up an involuntary chorus, etc... It is thoroughly humorous. The plot spans multiple realms and timelines. There are spin-off stories that lead nowhere and others that are tied back into the main story line. There's the story of the struggling writer (the Master) and his soul-mate (Margarita). The Master has a revelation and writes an epic novel. The novel is a new perspective on the events said to have occurred in ancient Judea circa 33 CE. The story within the story is that of the 5th Procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate and the wandering philosopher Yeshua Ha-Nozri. The book takes us to otherworldly realms, a midnight satanic ball, a witches coven, ancient Yerushalaim, an insane asylum, the air space above Moscow and several Moscow haunts. I found the beginning discussion of comparative religion (the occurrence of the immaculate maiden giving birth to a god in Eastern religions) and philosophy (the proofs of the existence of God proposed by Kant, Immanuel and Strauss) interesting. Although this is a work of fiction, after reading it, I am less apt to dismiss the existence of dark angels or evils spirits (Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, Belial, Baal, Molech). Keep in mind that this work casts a harsh light on the atheistic intellectual outlook of the former Soviet state. This book languished for many years (censured by the Stalinist state) and was published after the author's death.</span>

                    <span>"The Master and Margarita," Mikhail Bulgakov's sparkling fantasy of Satan's visit to Moscow under the guise of a magician named Professor Woland, must rank as one of the greatest acts of literary heroism of the past century. Bulgakov wrote the novel in the late 1930s, under what was arguably the most repressive government ever on earth--the Soviet Union at the height of Stalin's power. When even the mildest criticism of the regime led to a death sentence, Bulgakov dared to place all the cruelty, venality and treachery of 1930s Russia under a microscope. The book was of course unpublishable in Bulgakov's lifetime; it only appeared in its original form nearly a half-century after the author's death. We can chuckle at the wicked tricks Woland and his retinue play on various arrogant, incompetent Soviet officials, but knowledge of the power wielded by the real-life counterparts of those officials gives the chuckles a grim undertone indeed. The titular characters don't even appear until the book is nearly half-over: the Master, a despondent writer sent to an asylum after his novel about Pontius Pilate is rejected by the Soviet writers' union, and Margarita, the beautiful woman who loves him and will literally go to Hell for his sake. Through their dealings with Woland, Bulgakov exalts the power of the imagination, the need for the spiritual dimension in life and the courage to live by one's own convictions--virtues that Stalinist Russia strove, mostly successfully, to undermine. Interspersed with the tale of Woland, the Master and Margarita are chapters from the Master's novel, depicting Pontius Pilate's dealings on the day of the Crucifixion with Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus of Nazareth), Levi Matvei (St. Matthew) and Judas of Kerioth (Iscariot). The leading theme of those chapters is the essential nature of humankind: are people good, as Yeshua argues, or bad, as Pilate does? Bulgakov never answers this question, and Christian fundamentalists will be outraged to find Levi Matvei and Woland at the end to be allies, albeit uneasy ones. But in the Stalinist moral vacuum that denied the existence of both Heaven and Hell, how could they avoid working together? Bulgakov insists that people have moral choices, and that the greatest evil comes from abdicating those choices, as Stalin not only encouraged but demanded. The Vintage International edition of "The Master and Margarita" benefits mightily from the idiomatic, easily flowing English translation by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor, and the afterword by Bulgakov biographer Ellendea Proffer provides invaluable information, from the standpoint of both the societal context and Bulgakov's own life history.</span>

                    <span>There are four translations of "The Master and Margarita" presently available Two of them, those by Mirra Ginsburg and Michael Glenny, are based upon a 1966 censored Russian version of the novel, while the later, Burgin/O'Connor and Pevear/ Volokhonsky translations are based upon the final uncensored version. Additionally, the latter two translations contain useful endnotes (footnotes would have been preferable) that explain references to people, places and things in the Moscow of the Thirties.<P>Despite these shortcomings, after reading all four translations, I found that I enjoyed the Ginsburg translation the most. Since I do not read Russian, I based that opinion on the facts that (1) for me, it read the most smoothly, and (2) the comic passages were simply funnier in her translation (Russians, justifiably consider the novel to be a comic masterpiece). I attribute these characteristics to the Ms. Ginsburg having been born and raised in the country of Byelorussia and her being a successful writer (in English!) in her own right.<P>Based upon those criteria, I rank the translations as follows:<P>1. Mirra Ginsburg (1967) [ISBN 0802130119]. Simply the most readable. Read also her translation of "Life of a Dog."<P>2. Diana Burgin and Katherine O'Connor [ISBN: 0679760806]. Conveys a wonderful sense of mood, especially in the Pontius Pilate chapters.<P>3. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (1997) [ISBN: 0141180145]. I had the sense that this is the most accurate translation, but it is less literary than the two preceding choices. The comic passages simply do not come across. Pevear and Volokhonsky, a husband and wife team, are prolific translators of Russian literature. I have enjoyed several of their other translations, but this one just does not seem to work.<P>4. Michael Glenny (1967) [ISBN: 0679410465]. No reason to buy this one.<P>Having read all four, would I do it again? Absolutely! I'm convinced that this is one of the great novels of the 20th century, and with each reading I picked up subtleties that I had not noticed before.</span>
