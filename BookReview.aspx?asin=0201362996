                    <span>If you use LaTeX --- and if you want to create nice looking documents you probably should --- then you'll want this book. <BR> <BR>This book is well organized and well written. The information is presented very clearly and with many examples. While it is fun to browse through, it is also easy to find any specific information that you're looking for. And any information on LaTeX that you want will almost certainly be in here; the book is quite comprehensive. I had expected the book to cost much more than it does, particularly given how much it covers; I was pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive it is.<P>While it isn't a tutorial for someone who's never used LaTeX before, anyone who uses LaTeX for non-trivial documents will find themselves leafing through this book</span>

                    <span>I have been a TeX/LaTeX user since 1982, and have authored several classes and styles (newlfm). I just got my copy of the new The LaTeX Companion (2nd Edition). I just love it!! Why? 942 pages of text, 94 pages of the index (YEP!), wonderfully clear examples, 136 pages on fonts, a whole appendix on debugging, 72 pp on mathematics, etc. The book is well-written and uses clearly distinct fonts for user commands, internal commands, etc. There are 138 pages about fonts. In the mathematics chapter, there are 104 examples in the Math chapter alone; one REALLY COOL section shows 10 different font choices and their impact on the typesetting of a small page of mathematics. HOT STUFF!!<P>In short, there is only 1 limitation to the book: It does not have LaTeX/TeX lion on the front. That is hard to accept. However, everything else is really good. I highly recommend this.</span>
