                    <span>This is the best of the best New Orleans cookbooks. I bought my first copy in 1975. It is stained and falling apart and I will not part with it. The recipes are authentic,well written, easily understood and they all come out delicious. I have given copies of the book to each of my children and now my friends want copies, too. I can't recommend this book highly enough. the navy bean soup and the shrimp creole recipes are family favorites, along with the chicken gumbo, soaked salad...I could go on and on. if you like Creole food you can't go wrong with this book.</span>

                    <span>This is my favorite New Orleans cookbook. It contains all of the definitive creole and cajun recipes. I have been cooking from this book for over twenty years. My dishes made from these recipes are good enough to allow me (and anyone else) to pass as a native New Orleanian. <P>This book is an original. It was first compiled in 1975 -- before the Cajun cuisine became a national fad. In our family recipes are generally referred to as "THE", implying that no mere imitation or substitute will do. What! this in not "THE" potato salad! Are you bringing "THE" gumbo? Rima & Richard Collin have created "THE" New Orleans Cookbook.</span>

                    <span>This is a romantic book. I have read it cover to cover and it brought up wonderful memories of the brief time I have spent in New Orleans and vicinity. So far, I have made only one dish (White Bean Soup) so far and it was very bad. I found the directions confusing, which may have contributed to the failure. I also suspect they got the recipe from some colorful Cajun type sitting under a live oak smoking something funny. However,in spite of my nasty comments, I will make good use of this book as a source of ideas to adapt my tried and true dishes. As an example, I will adapt the bean soup recipe in an attempt to replicate a memorable bean soup I had in Tupelo, Missippi many years ago. <P>This not a cookbook for inexperienced cooks</span>

                    <span>This is the real actual thing. I have inspected perhaps 40 books on the local cuisine. This book easily comes closest to the way regular N'awlins folks cook and eat. It is simple, unpretentious, and quality. People everywhere will be able to either find the ingredients or make simple substitutions with locally available items. Bon appetit!</span>
