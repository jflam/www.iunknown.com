                <span id="Label1">Coauthored by Brian Kernighan, one of the pioneers of the C programming language, <I>The Practice of Programming</I> is a manual of good programming style that will help any C/C++ or Java developer create faster, more maintainable code.<p> Early sections look at some of the pitfalls of C/C++, with numerous real-world excerpts of confusing or incorrect code. The authors offer many tips and solutions, including a guide for variable names and commenting styles. Next, they cover algorithms, such as binary and quick sorting. Here, the authors show how to take advantage of the built-in functions in standard C/C++. When it comes to data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and trees, the authors compare the options available to C, C++, Java, and even Perl developers with a random-text-generation program (using a sophisticated Markov chain algorithm) written for each language.<p> Subsequent sections cover debugging tips (including how to isolate errors with debugging statements) and testing strategies (both white-box and black-box testing) for verifying the correctness of code. Final sections offer tips on creating more portable C/C++ code, with the last chapter suggesting that programmers can take advantage of interpreters (and regular expressions) to gain better control over their code. A handy appendix summarizes the dozens of tips offered throughout the book.<p> With its commonsense expertise and range of examples drawn from C, C++, and Java, <I>The Practice of Programming</I> is an excellent resource for improving the style and performance of your code base. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>Unfortunately, this book didn't give me much. It more or less is a extract of scattered wisdoms found in Steve McConnells "Code Complete" and Jon Bentleys "Programming Pearls." A lot of the examples and ideas brought forward in "The Practice of Programming" seem to be taken more or less directly from those books. I highly recommend getting the original works instead, as they are more complete, in-depth and also present a more consistent and enjoyable read.</span>

                    <span>Simplicity, Clarity and Generality are indeeds the qualities of fine code. This is one of the few books that strives to make you a better programmer. Most books are about how-to, this is a book that goes beyond that and gives you information that can make you better. The other two books that do this for me are "Programming Pearls" by Jon Bentley and "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler.
<br />
<br />The pedigree of the authors is something that you should not dismiss lightly, after all, Brian Kernighan is the "K" in the K&R book, and also with Rob Pike the author of "The Unix Programming Environment". 
<br />
<br />Lots of good stuff.</span>

                    <span>This book is perfect, it's not really for beginners, but more for someone crossing over to an intermediate level of programming, and wishes to learn some golden rules to keep in mind while programming.<p>The book is written in an incredibly simple and straight-forward way, which makes everything incredibly simple to grasp, and memorable. I know more than a handful of UNIX programmers that all either keep this book on their desktop for reference, or read it at least once a year.<p>This is the book I'd recommend to anyone who wants to "program better", this book probably won't teach you any new techniques, but it will teach you how to make your code more solid, more readable, and more enjoyable to maintain/debug.</span>
