                <span id="Label1">   Make the ultimate connection to the consumer with a gripping story about your brand. <P> <br>    Inspiring fanatic loyalty and consumer involvement, heroic brands tell a story that consumers are eager to adopt as their own.  Working step by step, marketing strategists learn to unleash their narrative powers in order to craft a powerful brand story that mirrors the core beliefs of the consumer group.  <P>    Laurence Vincent's book examines the powerful mythology surrounding such revered brands as <i>Kodak, Starbucks, Harley Davidson, Coca-Cola</i>, and many more.  He shows marketers how to think like storytellers in order to draw consumers into a lifelong relationship.  Step by step, readers will learn how to craft a narrative that is based on the most fundamental, or "sacred", beliefs of their consumer group.  From creating a "brand bible"(containing unassailable truths about the brand), to inventing characters, plot, conflict, and resolution, <i>Legendary Brands</i> is a practical guide to storytelling as strategy.</span>

                    <span>Harley, Kodak, Nike, Apple, Linux. The secret to the phenomenal success of these brands is the "narrative" that communicates the underlying brand philosophy, one that engages and inspires consumers to use and stay loyal to these "legendary brands".<P>A slew of pages is devoted to theorizing about these brands' narrative structure and occasionally the pseudo-scientific verbiage is a little distracting (e.g., "Brand mythology acts upon the cognitive orientation centers of the brain in much the same way that religion and other deeply held philosophical beliefs do").<P>Yet, all this could have been easily overlooked by the fastidious reader, but without a more organized analysis of how these seemingly facile narratives were conceived, attained, and then maintained by our "legendary" brands, the book falls short of its expectations. Some discussion of the evidence, even anecdotal, would have made this 5 star material although it may still be an interesting collectible for the insightful magazine style discussions of successful branding endeavours.</span>

                    <span>What makes a brand become the stuff of legend? Author and consultant Laurence Vincent says it's the power of a good story. Vincent, whose specialty is forging alliances between consumer brands and entertainment properties, presents an interesting parallel between marketing and storytelling that makes sense in today's increasingly cluttered media environment. Vincent introduces you to the basics of myth and storytelling. He explains how these concepts apply to marketing strategy and offers plenty of real-world examples and case studies to illustrate his points. Except for predicting the coming integration of advertising and content (it's been around for decades), Vincent's book is full of fresh insight. We from getAbstract recommend this book to brand managers and marketing executives who want to learn how to turn their brands into powerful icons. Legendary Brands takes the reader step by step through the process - just like any good story.</span>

                    <span>There are several excellent books on the subject of brand management and this is one of the best. Vincent selects several of what he calls "legendary brands" and explains how each flourished through a combination of storytelling and a "winning market strategy." These brands include Levi's, Starbucks Coffee, Absolut Vodka, Apple Computer, Nike, and Kistler Vineyards. Vincent insists that legendary brands do not depend on size, tenure, quality, and geography and reach as well as advertising and design don't matter. What does? "A Legendary Brand is different from other brands because it projects a sense of celebrity within its consumer base. It takes on a human persona, and attracts a following in much the same way that human celebrities do." Moreover, Legendary Brands "stand for concepts, values, and objects that consumers use to interpret meaning in their own lives." That is, they represent, indeed manifest the personality of the consumer. As a result, a Legendary Brand "allows consumers to order themselves in social, cultural, and personal space." Each "is a story handed down for generations among a people, and popularly believed to have a historical basis, although not verifiable." <P>Vincent introduces and then explains what he calls a Brand Mythology System. It has four components: a worldview comprised of a set of sacred beliefs, a brand agent, brand narrative (or "story"), and consumer participation through a special set of of consumer feedback activities. Frequent patrons of a local Starbucks, for example, have the same shared values as those who belong to a private club. <P>Some of the most interesting ideas are provided in Chapter 10 as Vincent examines different types of brand agents which can be persons (e.g. Hugh Hefner, Martha Stewart, and Colonel Sanders), places (e.g. Disney theme park, Sesame Street, and Augusta National Golf Club), or things (e.g. Kate Spade handbag, Mont Blanc pen, and Rolex timepiece). In each instance, the agent connects the brand with the consumer through the power of positive association: wearing Michael Jordan's brand of basketball footwear, entering the Magic Kingdom, or wearing golfwear bearing the Masters logo. Obviously, there are few Legendary Brands. However, those responsible for managing new or emerging brands as well as those attempting to revitalize established brands can learn much of value from Vincent's book by understanding his various concepts and then following the guidelines he suggests. <P>Those who share my high regard for Vincent's book are urged to check out Stephen Denning's Springboard: How Storytelling Ignites Action in Knowledge-Era Organizations, Brands: The New Wealth Creators co-edited by Susannah Hart and John Murphy, and Bernd Schmitt Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands.</span>
