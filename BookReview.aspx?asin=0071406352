                    <span>This is an amazing book that is a must-have for anyone that is in the industry, interested in being in the industry, or just plain interested in the world of digital video. Editing Digital Video by Robert M. Goodman and Patrick McGrath is an exceptionally well-written book that covers techniques in craft and theory about editing that can benefit the novice home video editor to the professional feature film editor. The authors complete the daunting task of covering all of the many different digital editing interfaces by stripping them down to the essentials. They also cover the many different kinds of formats, such as narrative, documentary, commercials, music video, etc. For the expert, I found the Keyboard Shortcut Cross Reference exceptionally handy. This book also covers recording DVDs, EDL formats, and details about exporting graphics. Being an editor initially learning editing techniques by physically cutting film and graduating to digital video editing, I very much appreciated this book that respected editing as a craft and art. <BR>The fundamentals about storytelling and editing are definitely worth reading. Some of it might be a bit too Editing 101, but surprisingly, held some gems. The "Films to Watch" chapter with films that have been recommended for different genres of editing to lists of Eddie Award Nominees and Oscar Nominees is an added bonus.<BR>Written in a very readable and likeable prose, Editing Digital Video is an absolute joy and a must for any editing enthusiast, whether in trade or in hobby.</span>

                    <span>Let's face it, most people doing digital video are self-taught. Sure, there are some who've been to film school or have lots of experience with film but of all the DV camera owners, they're in the minority. The result: hours and hours and hours of weddings, school plays, birthday parties and... well... tripe. This book can help turn that tripe into gold because it covers the black art of editing.<BR>Editing is one of those subjects that seems to be hard to teach through a book and, therefore, hard to learn. The solution employed by the authors is to include a CD containing three video clips for the reader to edit. The overall process is described in the text.<BR>There's a wealth of other good information, some quite basic, some fairly advanced - a perusal of the table of contents will be informative to you.<BR>Pros:<BR>* Platform and edit system neutrality<BR>* Video clips to edit<BR>* Tour of all the important concepts<BR>* Simple terminology<P>Cons:<BR>* No finished professional edit of the project<BR>* More detailed info on professional techniques would be nice</span>

                    <span>I've been in the marketing communications field for twenty years. During my tenure, I have worked in a variety of professional environments - from one of the world's largest marketing communications and advertising agency networks to operating my own small consultancy out of a home offfice. And, everything in between. Obviously, in larger organizations there are typically support personnel to develop and produce all video related efforts. In my past life all I needed to do was properly fill out a requisition form and wait for the results. Now that I'm operating independently, I'm always searching for the most appropriate educational resources to support my efforts in developing the best work I'm capable of. Upon discovering Editing Digital Video by McGrath and Goodman, I knew I found the perfect tool to enable me to more thoroughly understanding and orchestrate the many nuances associated with producing and editing professional videos. This book is a must-have for anyone needing to understand the road to better video editing and production.</span>

                    <span>"Editing Digital Video" is a good overall review of editing. The book tries to touch on both the creative and the technical. It may be hard to teach the creative in these short pages, but it at least points you in the direction. Although it was in depth in teaching the basic of the basics of editing, such as "What is a shot?" it lacked when it came to describing more technical terms such as "What is 16:9?" It also gives an overview of all editing systems, nothing in depth on specific ones, such as Avid or Final Cut Pro, granted many have conformed to the same operations, it would have been nice to have subtle differences pointed out.<BR>Overall, I think this book is a good book for beginner's and for advanced editor's that occasionally have brain freezes when working.</span>
