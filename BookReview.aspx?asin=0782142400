                    <span>This book has meat and breaks it down so that you can get it all.  A lot of people do project management and this book is a great introduction to the terms that are used in the test.  For me, knowing the terms for what I already do has encouraged me to sit for the exam.  I think that there are a lot of you out there who do project management and don't even know it.  This book will help you formalize and tweak what you may already know.</span>

                    <span>I started reading the book as a reference tool and have actually found it very useful for the work I've been doing.  I like how easy it is to follow.  It condenses Project Management down into a readily available format which, for some of the things I've needed, is quite helpful.  <p>While I haven't tried all of the exercises yet, the scenarios presented are real life and easy to identify as existing in any project or organization.   <p>I also like the fact that ANSWERS get included in the workbook.  I hate having to contact the instructor for the answers for questions in the text.  I'd rather have them on hand for when I'm ready for them.<p>While designed to go with the study guide, the workbook can stand alone and really brings the content into focus.<p>Personally, I think the book works as an excellent "Quick Reference" guide as well as a workbook to study by.<p>Overall, I like what has been done!  That's why I keep it with me.  I'm seeing practical application of what I've studied in the pages of the workbook and I love having the information in such a user-friendly format.</span>
