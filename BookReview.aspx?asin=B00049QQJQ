                <span id="Label1">This big, boisterous adventure is more inspired by than based on Rudyard Kipling's famous poem. Legendary screenwriters Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur have fashioned a rousing Hollywood movie full of high adventure, knockabout comedy, and old-fashioned male bonding. And old-fashioned it is: the trio of British officers and best friends who form the core of the film are a 19th-century three musketeers in India, threatened by the interventions of a woman who means to marry the dashing Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). Blustery commander MacChesney (Victor McLaglen) schemes to keep Ballantine in the army while his second in command, the treasure-hunting Cutter (Cary Grant in a hopelessly mugging comic performance), continues searching for his elusive mother lode, but all their plans are thrown into chaos when the rise of the bloodthirsty Thugs threaten Britannia's soldiers. Sam Jaffe takes up the rear guard in turban, loin, and full-body make-up as the titular Gunga Din, the loyal water carrier who dreams of becoming a soldier. Bombastically chauvinist and naively imperialist, the film is bound to rub some people wrong, but Stevens creates a thrilling spectacle in the grand Hollywood mold, a handsome, exciting classic comic adventure that helped make 1939 Hollywood's grandest year. <I>--Sean Axmaker</I></span>

                    <span>If you want a great "ripping yarn" about the British Raj, this 1939 Hollywood classic is it.  It is, indeed "more inspired by than based on Rudyard Kipling's famous poem" although you will see a Kipling character at the end, much as in Huston's "The Man Who Would Be King."  The film revolves arounbd a trio of British sergeants in late Victorian India. There's Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) and his senior sergeant, MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who teams up with Sergeant Cutter (Cary Grant) to get Ballantine to re-enlist and avoid becoming a tea merchant.  The interaction between the three is delightful.  Carey Grant loves every second as a cockney fortune-seeker. Victor McLaglen, well, he always plays the burly, blustering, loveable type, whether it's John Wayne's sidekick sergeant in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," brawling Squire Red Danaher in "The Quiet Man," or the head of the broken clan in "trouble in the Glen."   The cult of Kali and the Thugees are on the loose, and threatening the Raj!  But the three sergeants need help.  Loyal and sycophantic Sam Jaffe answers the call as the noble-spirited, eponymous water bearer, and he'll remind viewers of Saheed Jaffrey as Gurka Billy Fish in ".  The film will strike modern viewers as a little racist but fits well into the milieu of the times.  Its fun, a good adventure, and a true classic!</span>

                    <span>  The British Army battles a Thuggee uprising in colonial India.
<br />  There are action movies, there are good action movies, and there is George Stevens' 1939 GUNGA DIN, the greatest action movie ever filmed.  It has it all, as the director's son George Stevens, Jr. reminds us in the recent `making of' feature bundled with this dvd - humor, action and humanity.  Not - alas - romance (poor Joan Fontaine.)  A disappointing, albeit beautiful, actress up to that point, Fontaine is nothing much than a plot device used to lure one of the film's soldiers three - Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. - away from the other two, Victor McLaglen and Cary Grant.  
<br />  In that same feature are some circa 1985 interview clips of Fairbanks, who tells us that while filming some of the actors wondered if GUNGA DIN was dosed a little too liberally with humor. Indeed, few action movies this side of Indiana Jones are quite so persistently jaunty, few lean so close to slapstick.  Grant has the lead comic role, but McLaglen and Fairbanks have their share of gags as well.  It's not a comedy, but the humor adds essential air to the proceedings.
<br />  The bad guys in GUNGA DIN are malevolent, grim, Kali (the Goddess of Destruction) worshiping Thuggees.  The Thuggees are a deadly threat who aren't allowed a slapstick moment.  If GUNGA DIN'S humor adds a necessary lightness, the Thuggee menace adds essential weight.  These guys are creepy, evil incarnate, and it's in the battles with them - especially the breathtaking grand battle at the end - that the movie generates its thrills.
<br />  We have only to account for that rarest of action movie qualities George Jr. mentioned - humanity.  Of course, it's embodied in the title character Gunga Din, played by the then relatively unknown Sam Jaffe.  Jaffe is pitch-perfect in the role of the beastie, or water-carrier, who dreams of becoming a soldier. Film historian Rudy Behlmer tells us on the commentary track that Jaffe modeled his performance on Sabu, the Indian actor who was the first choice but unavailable for the role. Jaffe, we're told, approached the role as if he were Sabu - a derivative approach who's only virtue is that it works.  Jaffe's Din IS humanity - childlike, questing, capable of deeds that make hardened soldiers (and most of the audience, I wager), weep. Din's simple wish is to be accepted, and it is Din who is the soul of this movie.
<br />  GUNGA DIN is the best action movie ever, bar none.  Strongest recommendation for this essential movie.

                    <span>1939 was a bumper crop year for cinema magic and George Steven's "Gunga Din" is no exception to the rule. A sprawling, sweeping, comedy/action/adventure yarn with few equals; it is a masterful example of Hollywood's studio system hard at work. RKO pulled out all the stops; casting Cary Grant (Cutter), Victor McLaglen (MacChesney) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.(Ballantine) as a trio of mischievous knockabout British officers who stumble upon the murderous Thugee cult in 19th century India (...one can see where Steven Spielberg borrowed his idea for `Temple of Doom'). When the inhabitance of a nearby village to their outpost mysteriously disappear this bombastic sect of musketeers set out for truth, justice and revenge - not necessarily in that order. The outstanding and poignant performance by Sam Jaffe as the turban and loin clothed title character, Gunga Din, is a naïve and imperialist incarnation, but carried off with such panache that its hard to resist. Joan Fontaine gets the thankless role of the romantic ideal for Ballantine, working against type as the sometimes headstrong, Emaline. A handsome and enthralling screen spectacle, "Gunga Din" is what Hollywood used to mean by grand entertainment! <p>Warner's DVD transfer is a mixed blessing. Though much of the film looked far younger and is more perfectly realized than ever before on any home video format, the print source material is riddled throughout with age related artifacts (dirt, scratches, tears and misregistration) and a considerable amount of film grain in spots. The gray scale has been very nicely rendered with solid blacks and generally clean whites. There are no digital anomalies (aliasing, pixelization, edge enhancement) for an image that is otherwise quite smooth. The audio is mono and, at times, somewhat muffled. Extras include a brief but comprehensive `making of' documentary, a fine audio commentary and two theatrical trailers.</span>
