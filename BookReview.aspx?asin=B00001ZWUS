                <span id="Label1">When Steven Spielberg was an adolescent, his first home movie was a backyard war film. When he toured Europe with <I>Duel</I> in his 20s, he saw old men crumble in front of headstones at Omaha Beach. That image became the opening scene of <I>Saving Private Ryan</I>, his film of a mission following the D-day invasion that many have called the most realistic--and maybe the best--war film ever. With 1998 production standards, Spielberg has been able to create a stunning, unparalleled view of war as hell. We are at Omaha Beach as troops are slaughtered by Germans yet overcome the almost insurmountable odds. <p>  A stalwart Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a soldier's soldier, who takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action. It's a public relations move for the Army, but it has historical precedent dating back to the Civil War. Some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes. If that is so, this movie gives stereotypes a good name: Tom Sizemore as the deft sergeant, Edward Burns as the hotheaded Private Reiben, Barry Pepper as the religious sniper, Adam Goldberg as the lone Jew, Vin Diesel as the oversize Private Caparzo, Giovanni Ribisi as the soulful medic, and Jeremy Davies, who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance. <p>  The movie is as heavy and realistic as Spielberg's Oscar-winning <I>Schindler's List</I>, but it's more kinetic. Spielberg and his ace technicians (the film won five Oscars: editing (Michael Kahn), cinematography (Janusz Kaminski), sound, sound effects, and directing) deliver battle sequences that wash over the eyes and hit the gut. The violence is extreme but never gratuitous. The final battle, a dizzying display of gusto, empathy, and chaos, leads to a profound repose. <I>Saving Private Ryan</I> touches us deeper than <I>Schindler</I> because it succinctly links the past with how we should feel today. It's the film Spielberg was destined to make. <I>--Doug Thomas</I></span>

                    <span>Master filmmaker Steven Spielberg presented this groundbreaking film, set against the backdrop of World War 2. And the resulting film is stunning, gritty and powerful. It pulls no punches with its realistic display of warfare, avoiding glorification. In the first 25 minutes, D-Day is recreated with a level of reality never seen on-screen. Aggressive filmmaking, Spielberg and Uber-composer John Williams left the Omaha Beach invasion without a musical score making the attack all the more realistic.<P>The story itself follows a group of soldiers sent on a mission to pluck one soldier, PVT RYAN from the war and send him home safely to his mother. The squad leader Miller, portrayed by Tom Hanks works hard to keep his group focused on their mission, as the thought of their mission causes morale issues. All the time, lives are lost as the war conflict escalates.<P>The casting is great and many of the young soldiers have since started fruitful careers. Tommy Sizemore, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Edward Burns and Matt Damon have gone on to more roles. Even Ted Danson makes an appearance. Spielberg uses some of his most aggressive filmmaking yet and earned his Academy Award. This is a stunning film, but may be too graphic for more sensitive viewers.<P>The DVD has a great audio transfer whether you get the 5.1 or DTS issue. The video transfer in 1 1.85:1 widescreen format is stunning preserving Janusz Kaminski's gritty cinematography. Also included is a short making of documentary. A stark and important film.</span>

                    <span>Does anyone still believe WWII was the good war, and that cynicism, spin control and U.S. brutality were born in Vietnam? If so, Steven Spielberg's visceral re-creation of the Secend World War experience will be a shocker: The film's battle scenes are anarchic, bloody, frenzied and studded with atrocious acts. Screenwriter Robert Rodat's script (based loosly on an actual incident and heavily indebted to historian Stephen Ambrose), however, sticks to familiar ground. Battled-scarred Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent on a special mission to retrieve one Private Ryan (Matt Damon), who merits heric efforts because he's the sole survivor of four enlisted brothers, and his safe return is conceived as a home-front morale booster. Miller's hand-picked squadron is a checklist of war-movie types--hard-nosed sergeant (Tom Sizemore); decent private (Vin Diesel); Brooklyn wiseass (Edward Burns), introspective medic (Giovanni Ribsi); tough Jew (Adam Goldberg); pious Southern sharpshooter (Barry Pepper); and bookish corporal (Jeremy Davis) with no frontline experience--whose destinies follow a well-worn path. The exception is the GI who clings to the hope that war exposes the hidden strength in men, and instead has the worst wrenched out of him in a scene that elicits scattered applause but seems designed to evoke a mixture of pity and contempt. The movie's greatest strength lies in phenomenal performances that reach from the leads right down to the smallest supporting roles: Hanks' affability is worked under Miller's hardened skin, and Damon gives Ryan a boyish determination ans convincing as it is naive. Spielberg does some of his best work (the pointless preasent-day framing sequence notwithstanding), but follows in distinguished footsteps: Among the films that should'nt be lost in the rush to praise are Samuel Fuller's harrowing BIG RED ONE, whose credo--"The only glory in war is surviving"-- could be the movie's own.</span>

                    <span>Most of us expect a low-rate, pointless and overall tacky war movie from today's money-hungry industry, but SPR has done well in distancing itself from our presumptions. If you've never seen it before, than you'll be surprised at how well the movie is puit together. Aside from the usual modern-day method of pumping a movie full of A-List actors, a predictable script, less-than-impressive direction, irrelevent acting, and the overall novelty that one can come to expect of supposed dramas of today's glamour industry. <P>The story follows Captain John H. Miller and his team, including a sniper, a medic, an Arab, a surly private, and an acceptable Vin Diesel, to rescue James F. Ryan, a private in a paratrooper squad whose three brothers have been killed in action. A mission susceptible to much protest, and ultimately one that will cost many lives.<P>Everything about the movies feels as if it was done right. The overall atmosphere feels right, and it makes you feel as if you're sitting inside the movie--you can almost feel the moisture of the air seething through your clothes or the subtle sunshine warm your shoulders and forehead. The acting is very good as well, although you can spot some parts where improvement wouldn't hurt and it at times feels tacky and stunted. The direction is done well, as the actors can easily pass as soldiers, but the aforementioned cut corners could bring you away from the total immersion and feeling.<P>Saving Private Ryan is very worthwhile, and any war movie buff in his right mind would praise it as innovative and a revival of the genre.</span>

                    <span>I watched SAVING PRIVATE RYAN not knowing what to expect. I'm not a big war movie fan, my taste running more toward horror / sci-fi / comedy. Within seconds I was totally engrossed in this all-too-real depiction of WW II. The bullets ripping men apart, the panic, the frantic kill-or-be-killed atmosphere, the almost continuous chaos, interrupted only briefly by spurts of calm, all added up to one joltingly great movie classic! Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, and every castmember is believable and human. There are no cigar-chomping superheroes in this story, just regular guys in an overwhelmingly dire situation (I felt like even I could be one of them). Spielberg tears off the sugary coating of the typical war film, revealing the squirming guts beneath. Pulling zero punches, he shows us war up close and disturbingly personal. Still, SPR is filled with warmth, humor, and that sense of brotherhood that would risk so much for one soldier. I love this movie and cannot recommend it highly enough...</span>

                    <span>This movie was shafted at the 1998 Academy Awards. Just goes to show you that Hollywood doesnt have the depth to understand a film of this magnitude. Gross injustice is the best way I can describe the snub. Sure there are some parts of the film that appear to be a little unbelieveable and perhaps a bit embellished. All in all the film is an amazing portal into the Normandy invasions and spares us the Hollywood glitz that too many war movies in the past have shown. Tom Hanks best role and Stephen Spielbers finest moment on the silver screen. The tandem is golden and certainly showed in the "follow up" Band of Brothers. This ranks in my top 5 films of all time. Words cant express its emotional stranglehold on your heart and soul. The buzz is there will be an HBO miniseries preimering in 2005 focusing on the Pacific theater of WWII. Should make for some mind blowing viewing.</span>
