                    <span>I really enjoyed reading about Satchel Paige in this story. Here is some information on this terrific book about Satchel Paige. Leroy or, Satchel Paige was one of the greatest pitchers of all time. He once pitched three innings for Oakland A's when he was 64 years old, which is a world record. When he was little he grew his strong arm by throwing rocks at chickens. Satchel was sometimes a trouble-maker also. Once he got into trouble the police because he tried to rob a store. When Satchel was older he played in the Negro Leagues. A little later he had arm trouble and became a coach of a team. Then suddenly his came back and he could pitch again. Even though Paige was such a good pitcher he never made it to the majors until he was in his 50's because he was black and blacks weren't aloud to play at the time. Then he met someone who was with the Cleveland Organization and he then singed with the Indians. He retired at age 64 after he pitched for the A's. Lesa Cline-Ransome tells a great life story about Leroy Paige. This book is a great book for kids who like baseball or just for anyone.</span>

                    <span>Leroy "Satchel" Paige was a larger than life figure, whose legendary exploits do not easily lend themselves to pictures, even boldly colored paintings by James E. Ransome.  In her folksy narrative, Lesa Cline-Ransome tells of how some of the facts of Satchel's life are a bit exaggerated, like the idea that he was born with his right fist curled around a baseball.  Young readers will learn how he got his nickname and how his talent for throwing rocks at chickens eventually led to Satchel becoming one of the greatest baseball pitchers of all time, but they will not really get a sense for how he became the great and colorful character that made him the one and only Satchel.  In this book Satchel gets out of reform school, starts playing baseball to make money to help feed the family, and suddenly he is coming up with creative names for all of his pitches and taunting batters.  I think that in the final analysis only Satchel's own words can do justice to the man's life and career.  Mere images can never hope to truly capture him and any words other than his own seem incomplete.  However, if reading this book leads young readers to learn more about the legendary Satchel Paige, then that would be a good thing.</span>

                    <span>We thoroughly enjoyed reading Satchel Paige, and feel it is a terrific book for folks of all ages, not just the younger set. Lesa Cline-Ransome truly captures the time period in describing the hardships the league players had to endure for their love of the game.In addition to being a good biography, as well as a reference book, James Ransome's beautiful  illustrations put this work in the category of coffee table book, to be on  display for those who visit to peruse. It's a perfect combination: a good  read, and compelling illustrations!</span>
