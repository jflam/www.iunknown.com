                    <span>When I first read an excerpt of this book I was floored. Just the excerpt made me remember that group of ballplayers. The only one I liked was Mookie. I grew up as a Cub fan and that stretch of Mets was so hated. 
<br />The first time I ever swore in front of my father and didn't get smacked was when I was swearing at Gary Carter. After this book I wanna swear at him some more.
<br />Dykstra, Hernandez, Knight, I hated them all. Now I'm glad they didn't stick together to kick the Cubs around for another 5 years. 
<br />Pearlman's personal investment in his subjects seems to detract a little from a complete madhouse story about a bunch of madhouse escapees, but he gets the job done with an obviously sympathetic style. So many "what ifs" and so few answers. Jesse Orosco's presence will be felt forever. </span>

                    <span>This is an outstanding book for any Mets fan and should be a blast for any baseball fan to read. I laughed my ASS off at some of these stories. As for the reviews that claim this book was 'poorly written', hey, this isn't freakin' War & Peace, it's the kick-ass '86 Mets. GREAT BOOK!!!!</span>

                    <span>This book takes you back to that unforgettable '86 season when baseball players weren't unbelievably rich, didn't take supplemental growth hormones, but did many other things that would be taboo by today's standards.  Here was a team that we remembered that was so diverse that you would be hard pressed not to identify with at least one of the members.  The story is about redemption for some and fulfilling destiny for others.  It is a great account of the full season and what led up to it when all most people remember is the Bill Buckner play of Game 6 in the World Series.  This provides insight as to much more of what that Mets team was.  Although they were favorites to go the distance from the onset, it is an underdog story when you see the players that make up the team and the story of the Mets franchise itself.  You will find yourself taken back to a not-so-distant time when Times Square wasn't a real nice area and the baseball players loved those 2 classic male vices...booze and women.  However, the book is more than a sensational version of events retold.  You do get a real sense of what made the team tick and how each member in his own way played a vital part to their collective success.  This is a great read for baseball fans everywhere.    </span>

                    <span>"The Bad Guys Won..." is what it is -- a collection of stories and player profiles set against a single championship season, one of the most impressive and unique seasons a baseball team has ever produced.  Unlike other books chronicling one single baseball campaign, like David Halberstam's "Summer of '49" or "October 1964", or others like "The Last Good Season," there isn't much else the book has to offer.  But that's not to say it wasn't entertaining and enjoyable.  
<br />
<br />Jeff Pearlman takes you through the 1986 Mets championship season, focusing almost entirely on the players and their antics, seemingly going through the entire roster and passing along stories that the reader cannot help but laugh at.  All the major characters are covered heavily -- Dykstra, Strawberry, Gooden -- but there really shouldnt be anyone from the team upset over a lack of print.  Fans of the '86 Mets probably won't learn all that much, since, I'm pretty sure, many of the antics described in the book have become common knowledge by now.  But they'll probably love it anyway.  As for non-Mets fans like myself, I still got a kick out of it, and I'm sure most others will as well, unless you're in the hunt for a book with solid baseball analysis.
<br />
<br />The book shines in a couple of areas outside the realm of the players themselves.  There's the background of how the team was constructed after the filthy teams of the early-80's, the classic 18-inning Mets-Astros NLCS game, and some in-season tales like "Get Metsmerized" and such.  Also, it's funny to think about what would happen if this team was present in today's uptight sports world.  The 86 Mets couldnt exist today, not even 20 years later, because every little detail is so heavily scrutinized today that the media storm these guys would kick up would be off the charts.  Just look at the frenzy stirred up two weeks ago by the Randy Moss "fake mooning" in Green Bay -- can you imagine what would happen if today's New York and national (especially the national) media got a hold of some of the things Pearlman describes in this book?
<br />
<br />Speaking of Pearlman, one of the drawbacks to the book is the writing.  Luckily the stories themselves carry the book, because the storyteller leaves much to be desired.  He comes off too much as a fan and less like an author, and you could sense that he's so giddy writing about these guys that he rooted for as a kid, it's almost like he wants to think he was in that 1986 clubhuse with them palling around and being stupid.  He tries too hard to inject his own humor when it's not necessary, and a lot of his stuff falls flat.   I'm not saying he's a bad writer, but there is probably a reason why a lot of the more renowned books of this type are written by older, more experienced authors.  Perhaps Pearlman will reach that level eventually, but his writing in this book is what knocks it down a peg to me.  Although at one point, Pearlman does put his fanship to good use in his description of an encounter with former Met Dave Kingman.
<br />
<br />Overall though it's highly entertaining for all baseball fans, and sports fans for that matter.  The 1986 Mets were very unique, and with the way the sports world has become, a team like that probably won't be seen again.  </span>

                    <span>If ever there was a team that embodied the crazy 80s this was them.  The New York Mets were expected to do great things with their collection of stars and their 108 win regular season.  However, the playoffs were far from easy for them, with some miracles (including a Boston meltdown) helping them along the way to their second World Series title in history.  Most of this is well known by the casual baseball fan.
<br />
<br />What is less-known are the exploits of this group of meglomaniacal, immature misfits throughout the course of that crazy 1986 season.  Pearlman's look back as a guy who has grown up now but was only a young kid at the time is truly fantastic. You'll read about Doc and Darryl's run-ins with drug accusations, entire team food fights on airplanes, who had the worst gas (Doug Sisk), and the circumstances of how four Mets found themselves arrested by overzealous cops in Texas.  
<br />
<br />If you're a baseball fan, you'll enjoy this easy read.  It's nonstop fun and never seems to have slow moments.  An added bonus is that you need not be a Mets fan to enjoy this book -- it's a tale of adult immaturity and debauchery that anyone with a sense of humor and a love of baseball can (and will) enjoy.   </span>
