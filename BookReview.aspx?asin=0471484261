                    <span>This book was part of the required reading for my MBA program at UCI and so far it is the best strategic marketing text I have read. Prof. Aaker's writing style is both concise and eloquent, very well organized and easy to read. I will keep this book on my bookshelf for a long time, it is very "reusable" and goes way beyond the class room. A must-have for both corporate executives and enterpreneurs.</span>

                    <span>I used this book when I took a strategic marketing class in my MBA program. The author of this book did an excellent job in explaining strategic marketing concepts in a simple but practical way. The main  strength of this book is it is very well-organized and easy to follow. The  author also used many real-world samples to explain and support marketing  concepts presented in the text. I recommend that any business student who  has to take business policy class use this book as his or her reference.</span>

                    <span>I was first exposed to Aakers Strategic Market Management during a marketing strategy course at National University of Singapore. I really appriciated the disposition of the books. It is relatively thin, not many  words are useless (which is uncommmon in the case of marketing text  books).<p>Later, still a student, I got the opportunity to develop a  marketing strategy for a smaller firm. During this time Aakers book was of  the outmost value, being used for reference throughout the analysis. Highly  recommendable.</span>
