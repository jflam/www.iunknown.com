                    <span>And he gets bored with baseball books, according to his review on the sleeve.  You wouldn't think a regular season game would be all that interesting that it would warrant a book.  But the Yankees and Red Sox are perhaps the only two teams which a book like this could be written.  The story flows very nicely and there are some interesting tidbits on certain players that you may not know about.  Every perspective is covered in this book.  Player, general manager, owner, and fan are all accounted for.  I took off a star because of Kettman's epilogue that turned into a rant saying basically that the Yankees are evil and the Red Sox will someday win a World Series because of this wonderful group running the show.  Hey Steve, if I want a Red Sox homer I'll listen to Peter Gammons okay?  Other than that, this is a enjoyable book.  Just stop after the game is over.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. It made me feel like I was there watching the game along with the fans, owners and players that were interviewed for this book. An easy read,but a great way to get through the non-baseball months.</span>

                    <span>The author does a fantastic job of capturing the many nuances of Fenway that make her so unique.  I was particularly interested in reading about the Red Sox executives and their passion for their team - as fans.  As casual fans, we often forget that baseball is more than just a business to the many officials within the sport.  We at home often criticize the many decisions that they make, yet most do not have any comprehension of how complicated the business of baseball is.  Kettmann does an excellent job in bringing this out to the reader.  As another series gets under way between the Yanks and Sox, I feel like I have a deeper understanding of not only what makes this rivalry the best in all of sports, but also what makes rooting for the Sox in Fenway so special.   Kettmann and his crew of reporters deserve to be praised for their spot-on coverage of old Fenway.  If only they can make Shea seem half as interesting.</span>

                    <span>The book was entertaining and I felt it worth the read for the baseball angle (I didn't see the game in question so the ending was not spoiled for me in advance).  However, I found it a bit ironic that its depiction of a sport so lively and emotional came across as somehow bland and a bit dry.  The figures depicted in the story, though real life flesh and blood, came across as wooden and mechanical, even when emoting.  Somehow they seemed a little two-dimensional, and the story flowed along almost with machine-like predictability.  There were a few exceptions: Marty Martin, the fan who caught Jorge Posada's home run, threw it back onto the field, and was ejected from Fenway Park to find himself an instant hero, John Henry, owner of the Red Sox, and director Spike Lee, whose unpleasant rage-filled diatribes against the Red Sox - despite being given the honor of throwing out the first pitch at Fenway while decked out in his beloved Yankees shirt - brought a rancid taste to an otherwise vanilla-flavored story.  Perhaps Mr. Kettman's intention by incorporating the infantile views of Mr. Lee (who feels the Red Sox and their fans should  suffer for eternity due to allegedly racist decisions made by former managers long before any of the current team was ever conceived) was to depict the wide range of viewpoints present at Fenway on that day, from giddy to maniacal.  However, this component detracted from the appeal and dignity of the story.
<br />
<br />All in all this is a passable beach or plane book with some interesting insights, particularly into the rivalry between the Yankees and the Red Sox, but a bit lightweight in terms of plot or character development.</span>

                    <span>Having been born and bred around New York City and being a graduate of Boston University, I have the dubious distinction of being both a Yankee and Red Sox fan; although, I must admit that the Red Sox hold a place in my heart, and a defeat at the hands of "The Evil Empire" is always hard to swallow.  It was not until the account of the collision of Johnny Damon and Gabe Kapler in Mr. Kettmann's delightful book that I realized that I had watched that heart-wrencher of a game on TV.  It was at best a two-dimensional rendering compared to the multi-faceted story Mr. Kettmann relates.  Very familiar names and faces became real persons and Fenway Park came alive.  As though in slow-motion, every pitch and every at bat was relived with no commercial interruptions.  It was the most attention I ever paid to a baseball game.  If you love baseball, I suggest you read this book.</span>
