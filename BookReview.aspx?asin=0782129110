                <span id="Label1">C# is Microsoft's brand-new object-oriented language for the .NET platform, designed to make it easy for developers to create Web applications. Mastering Visual C# .NET is aimed at experienced C++, Visual Basic, and Java programmers who want a comprehensive resource to Visual C#. It delivers complete coverage of the essentials of the C# language, plus writing Windows and web applications. Topics include using the .NET base class library for basic programming operations like I/O and threads; database programming with ADO.NET; Web programming with ASP.NET; and creating XML Web Services. There is also a chapter on programming security with C#, including permissions and encryption. Author Jason Price has more than ten years' experience in the software industry and has worked with C#, .NET, Java, and Oracle. Coauthor Mike Gunderloy has written numerous books on Microsoft programming topics for Sybex, including ADO and ADO.NET Programming and .NET E-Commerce Programming.</span>

                    <span>Overall, I'd say this a great book for learning C#. Prior to reading the book I had knowledge of C++ fundamentals. For the most part, I didn't have any issues digesting most of the material in the book. Although, I will say that I didn't catch on to Mike Gunderloy's writing style quiete easily. I could tell something was different in the quality of the writing later on in the book and then realized (from the examples) it was Mike's writing. Maybe cause his topics were a bit more advanced. Knowing more now, I look back at it all and say its a good book to learn from scratch and a useful reference later on.</span>

                    <span>If you are familiar with OOP/C++/Java and want to pick up main C# concepts in a hurry, get this book. Although I did read Tom Archer's "Inside C#" before this one, and some tutorials on the net, I think this book deserves to be the first C# book for a beginner or an intermediate programmer. It has a decent aggregation & coherent explanantions of all the major C# topics and uses Visual Studio.NET IDE in its examples (which I think is really important for a C# book). One minor drawback is that some important topics(like Web Services and .NET Remoting) are given just a cursory treatment. But I guess, such vast topics merit devoted books just for those. Beware however, I came across 2 critical bugs - Ch 12, first page it says method signature is composed of method name,return type and parameter list (actually its just the parameter list and method name) and on page 794, chapter on ADO.NET it says to use Fill method on DataSet object to synchronize changes made to the DataSet with Database(in reality you should use Update method). It even gives an introduction to ASP.NET and ADO.NET but you have to look for other sources to learn those technologies well. 
<br />
<br />Overall, its a good book to invest your money and time in.</span>

                    <span>I got this book about a month ago and found it to be the best book on C# currently available. It teaches the C# language from scratch, and also teaches Active Server Pages .NET and VS .NET.<p>Highly recommended if you want to learn C# and .NET together.</span>

                    <span>No question this is the best book on C# out there. Section 1 teaches the core C# language. Section 2 teaches advanced C# programming. Section 3 teaches .NET programming, like ASP.NET and ADO.NET. This is really great value for money and I use this book on a daily basis. I have other C# books, but this one is the only one actually use.</span>
