                <span id="Label1">Brian Underdahl&#146;s <I>Complete Reference for Macromedia Flash MX</I> serves as a solid cornerstone for the library of new Flash designers. Covering every aspect of building interactive Flash projects from a beginner&#146;s perspective, this handy tome is an ideal reference guide for the interactive designer starting his Flash journey.<p>  Underdahl wastes little time getting the reader up and animating with Flash MX and things start to really happen in the "Adding Animation" section of his book. He opens with a short description of Flash&#146;s approach to animation, then quickly launches into a short set of tutorials. Before the end, you&#146;ll be moving, rotating, scaling and tweening objects all over the screen. The largest part of this seven-part volume is all about efficiency. Tool-by-tool descriptions fill up the first chapter in this section, but the author falls short here by not including the keyboard shortcuts for each tool when they&#146;re described. His descriptions and examples, though, are clear, and most are matched with screenshots demonstrating the tool at hand.<p>  Graphics and sound are thoroughly covered, especially importing and optimizing sounds, and using them efficiently within a Flash movie. This is critical, since the misuse of sound files can inflate the size of a Flash movie, as well as impact performance. ActionScript, the underlying programming engine that drives Flash interactivity, is presented clearly in a non-programmer manner. Flash is a unique application that bridges the gap between an animation tool and a programming environment, and lucky is the artist who can plant his feet on both shores. The enclosed CD contains project files and art elements for every chapter, as well as demo versions of Canvas 8 and the Windows versions of ToonBoom Studio and Swift 3D. The CD does not, however, have a searchable PDF version of the book with color pictures. This omission is exacerbated by the lack of color pages, making any discussion of color palettes or color schemes (chapter 6) somewhat theoretical.<p>  Complaints aside, this "Complete Reference" for Flash MX serves as a solid reference book, and should be seriously considered for any novice Flash designer looking for an encyclopedic tome on Flash MX. <I>--Mike Caputo</I></span>

                    <span>I got my hands on this book and at first I was so excited because this was one of the first Flash MX 2004 books on the shelves so I just bought it immediately. After reading the introduction, I learnt that this book decided to not cover Flash MX  2004 Professional. Oddly, it wasn't a "Complete" reference after all. Nonetheless, I wanted to get my money's worth so I started reading on.
<br />As much as the book seems to take a more text-based approach to explaining every tid bit of Flash, it fails miserably because it just seems like after reading 20 pages, you learnt something that could have been explained  to you in merely 5 pages. I felt like I was wasting my time and eventually I just stopped reading the book, went out and looked for other books available.
<br />If you REALLY want to learn Flash mx 2004, I'd suggest getting a book that takes you through tutorials rather than simply tells you what each thing does and runs you buy a tutorial the author does..
<br />Oh and there is simply not enough screenshots or graphics to go along with the text, either they are uselessly detailed images or they simply dont exist.
<br />I really hope I never come across another Flash MX 2004 book like this again. I wasted 384 pages worth of reading to this book and finally just let it go, I couldn't go on because it became so boring, reading it was like a painful job.</span>

                    <span>The first thing I liked about this book were the notes and tips in each chapter. Someone could just read the notes and tips and get some pretty good applicable tips on Flash MX. The book begins with the beginner in mind. I found the chapters on sound and video extremely helpful. I too have not read the Actionscript part yet, but know it will help me understand object programming using Actionscript 2.0 better than I do currently! Thanks for a great book!</span>

                    <span>This book does not attempt to cover the full edition of Flash MX 2004. If you have the professional version of Flash DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! The book is titled "The Complete Reference" for Macromedia Flash MX 2004 but "Complete" it is not. The book is only 700 pages. I should have purchased the "Bible" series for this application. Osborne books are pretty much hit or miss... and you don't know until you try to look something up.</span>

                    <span>I have quite a collection of Brian Underdahl's books and I have always found his writing style to be easy to understand, accurate, and entertaining.  I'm not new to Flash, but this book did a good job of introducing me to the changes in this new version of Flash.  <p>One of the other reviews said this has little coverage of Flash ActionScript, but then I noticed the review is from 2002 and seems to be referencing another book.  This one has PLENTY of ActionScript coverage- Chapters 20 to 31 to be exact!  And these aren't short chapters!<p>I always try and write up reviews of books I find useful and this one demands a 5-star review.  If you're looking for a book that covers Flash in-depth and will get you quickly up to speed (and not just making simple little animations) I can't recommend this book enough. <p>I am a technology consultant in Houston, TX and I have about 30 books in my collection on Flash alone.  Only about 10 are used frequently and this is one of them.</span>
