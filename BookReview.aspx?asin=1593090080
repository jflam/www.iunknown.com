                    <span>...and sometimes its takes a second try to actually get it right. This was an excellent book. Ms. Cheekes vividly painted the characters so well that I could picture them and I felt like I knew them personally. I finished it in three days and only because I made myself put it down. 
<br />
<br />Yani is a woman emotionally scared after being abandoned by her husband of over a decade. Alex Chance is a man sick of "gold diggers" and ready to settle down with someone who is sincere about wanting him for him. The two meet and its a match made in heaven...that is until her MIA husband returns and Yani has to chose between her first love who abandons her and the new love who has given her all the love she wants and needs. This is definitely a page turner that is sure to leave you wondering whats going to happen next.</span>

                    <span>After hitting a slump in reading...I found a book that gave me the kick I needed! Once I began...the pages kept turning and turning! A story that gives you that romantic feel...tear-eyed feel...anger feel, and suspense feel all in one storyline. With each chapter dedicated to each character of the book, you are able to know the thoughts and actions of each person in detail...which makes the story believable. I can't wait until the sequel!</span>

                    <span>This book was a very smooth reader.  Once you realized that each chapter was based on one of the characters in the book it made the reading more of a visual.  We can all relate to Carmen, intelligent, successful and a smart mouth.  Then there's Asia, who makes you know that you have a real friend in her.  Let's not forget Yani, who we all know is a little naive but has a beautiful spirit.  Hallelujah for Alex and Bryce to help us GAAL's keep hope that there are still good men left.  We all like happy endings, so thank you Shonda for leaving us with a smile and a positive spirit.   It's nice to see our loved ones living happily ever after.  This was a true example of the blessings you may be missing when you continue to live in the past.  Very postive book and I can't wait to read the next one.

                    <span>fortunately for me, were having a winter blizzard that would leave me trapped at home with my husband, the soccer channel, and (THANK GOD!!) Another Man's Wife. i had time on my hands, and i started the book, intending to read it, along with some others, over the next several days. think again! i couldn't put the book down. i was so feeling the main character and her desire to hang onto the ghost husband who'd disappeared, but i was still relieved when she met a man who seemed trustworthy and ideal. i was pulling for the new relationship and even identified with the main character's sister. no problems there, right? but then the story began to spiral into suspense and drama, and i got caught up! my hubby had to order in chinese and leave me alone while i spent the whole day and the whole night finishing the book. it was a really nice escape from reality-- very well-developed, and very believable, even the ending!
