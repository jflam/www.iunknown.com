                    <span>As I biologist, I am constantly frustrated by the unscientific (and often ultra-philisophical) interpretation that goes on when considering humanity, and particularly love. This book took the extreme interest that exists about human sexuality and love, and places them in a scientific light, without necissarily demonizing or undermining the amazing feelings that go along with love; Fisher simply explains the science behind these amazingly rich and powerful feelings in an attempt to better know ourselves.</span>

                    <span>A fascinating study of human mating behaviors, written from a non-judgmental, 
scientific point, "Anatomy" is a satisfying alternative to the ubiquitous self-help manual.
Flirting, love, adultery, and divorce are convincingly explained as mileposts in
 (wo)man's evolution on the African plains back thousands of millennia. The mating
 behaviors are shown to be anatomical, in that they are instinctive, not learned. There are
 hard truths here. Woman in middle-age are divorced because they can no longer
 reproduce and promulgate their male partner's genes. For women, sex is a commodity to
 be traded for comfort and security. Love is a few year thing, hooking a man long enough
 to raise a child past total dependency (today's Kindergarten.).
 	Knowledge without sentiment is powerful and can be dangerous. Exploitation of
 the mechanics of flirtation could be used by the unscrupulous. (certainly not a new
 thing!) The demystification of love may remove much from its experience. A wiser lover
 isn't a happier one.
 	"Anatomy of Love" weakens about half-way through as it becomes bit redundant.
 Not much is missed if the reader were to skim a little towards the end.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Fisher is to be congratulated for trying to extend our understanding of the mechanisms through which we experience the various forms of love she enumerates, and for trying to see beyond the trite social codes that are normally accepted at face value as received wisdom. But sadly her efforts are compromised by two fatal flaws. The first, and merely annoying, flaw is the inevitable requirement that a working academic must genuflect to the gods of Political Correctness. So after an interesting chapter that basically demonstrates we're unable to control ourselves when in the throes of strong emotion, she then makes the glib assertion that in fact we can and should control ourselves and never become stalkers etc. Dr. Fisher may herself believe in the moral "correctness" of this assertion but it is wholly unsupported by her work and therefore has no place in a would-be scientific book. <P>The far more serious flaw in the book is that Dr. Fisher, as she searches for explanations for some of the more dramatic mechanisms acting within us, seems utterly to misunderstand the rudiments of the theory of evolution. She posits all kinds of "evolutionary" forces that simply could never exist. She does not grasp that selection forces can only operate in the present and can never operate for some notional effect in the distant future. Evolution is simply not teleological, but this understanding eludes Dr. Fisher and so her "explanations" end up being silly and implausible. <P>So, what we have here is basically a work that provides a few tantalising glimpses into the biochemistry of emotions, yet fails to take more than the first baby-steps. It is greatly to be hoped that a more thoughtful and rigorous account will one day be written by some other researcher operating in this important area of study.</span>

                    <span>Helen Fisher tackles an extraordinarily important but seldom scientifically scrutinized aspect of human existence; love.<P>In this book she delves into the physiological and behavioral contributors to the state of being in love. Referencing both nature and nurture, the animal kingdom, and (still relatively) modern science she makes a darn interesting case to support "objectively quantifiable" factors as being responsible for an oft classified "ethereal" love.<P>Fun, informative, intensly interesting, I recommend this book highly.<P>Enjoy...</span>
