Finally, after five straight years of disappointments,  the Amherst Lady Hurricanes found they just might have what it took to go all the way. This is a fierce, funny, and intimate look into their minds and hearts during one very special season.  A finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction.</span>

                    <span>I confess to being a fanatic about girls basketball.  I've coached my daughters over a total of close to 9 years, and loved every minute of it.  I also went to college in Amherst, as did my eldest daughter.  She even knows one of the assistant coaches in the book.  
<br />I loved the book because of those interests, but I was a bit disappointed that it didn't provide more that would catch the interests of people who are not already passionate about it.  I was hoping I would be able to recommend it to the middle school girls I coach to provide them some inspiration, but it didn't fit that bill. It is more of an almost superficial study of some very committed girls without giving any insights as to why they were so committed.  Everybody knows that it takes commitment to win championships.  Where does that come from?  
<br />
<br />I recommend the book to the parents of girls who are passionate about basketball.  I recommend it to coaches of girls teams.  And I recommend it to anyone with ties to the Amherst area.  Beyond that, it's an ok read, and pretty short so it won't take a whole lot of time.
<br />
<br />p.s. unlike another reviewer, I didn't find a feminist agenda coloring the book. </span>

                    <span>I have read dozens of books about sports, and this one ranks up there with the best.  First of all, Madeleine Blais tells a great story, start to finish, of an exciting basketball season played by high school girls at the top of their game.  But Ms. Blais makes the reader care deeply about these girls by bringing them to life as full human beings.  The snapshots of their home lives, academic efforts, and personal relationships brings these girls alive.  Finally, this is a thoughtful book that, without ever preaching, makes you realize that girls are naturally just as competitive and spirited as boys.  Indeed, in these girls hope is a muscle.  May they all live long, productive, and happy lives.</span>

                    <span>I first read this book while I was still a member of a high school girls' basketball team.  While my teams never reached nearly the pinnacle that the Amherst team did, I think that this book captures the dynamics and ongoing relationships in sports, especially on a girls' team.  Each character comes vividly to life after reading it just once, and after a few times, they seem like good friends.  This book is a must for anyone who plays sports, watches sports, or is a sports parent.</span>

                    <span>This was probably a great magazine article before being padded out with geography and feminism history lessons. The story of the team and girls is great, but too much non-basketball stuff. Also more about the years they didn't win to set the stage would have been nice.</span>

                    <span>Blais creates an elegant tapestry which depicts the struggles of families undergoing the rite of passage of adolescence. Her characters embody the sacrifices which they and their families make to achieve success. <p>Why should you read this book? First, Blais blends humor and pathos in telling a 'feel good' story. Second, her prose and style simply inspire all readers to improve their writing. Third, she illustrates the generational transition resulting in the empowerment of women and the role athletics has played. Finally, she captures the spirit and the vicissitudes of the relationships between her characters, for example the two hour phone conversation where the team stars become friends instead of rivals. <p>You don't have to worship at the sports altar to enjoy this book, but it won't hurt. If you make the small effort to read this outstanding book, you may understand better how life has improved for your daughters and sons, your peers, and yourself.</span>
