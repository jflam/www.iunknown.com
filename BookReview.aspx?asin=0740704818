                    <span>If you're bored or sad or feeling lonely or just down, this is the perfect fix. With a cute animal photo and a brief sentence on every page, this book helps you see that everyone has bad days and that tomorrow promises wonderful new things. The black and white pictures are works of art and the captions match them perfectly. This book made me smile and laugh and cry. I received it as a gift from a good friend and I want to run out and buy copies for everyone I know who has ever felt down and out! A great gift idea!</span>

                    <span>This is not a self help book, nor is it a deep philosophical discussion about depression. I don't believe the author presents this book to be either of those things, and if that is what you are looking for then this is not for you. The clue to readers should be the fact that the book is heavy on pictures and light on writing. <P>That being said, the book is a wonderful look at how we feel when we are "blue", and why we sometimes feel that way. It is a simple little book that will hopefully make you smile, and know that this too shall pass. The pictures are wonderfully expressive, and match what is written perfectly. And what is written, though simple and concise, is honest. It brings a smile to my face, and to those with whom I have shared this book. What more can you ask for?</span>

                    <span>Greive has produced a cute little book that encourages the reader to make it through those inevitable and sometimes too-common blue days.<P>The book is about 90 pages long with a picture of an animal (often a funny-looking picture) with a caption mentioning either one of life's struggles or maintaining an optimistic point of view.<P>The book is good for a quick pick-me-up and some good laughs, even if some of the phrases are trite. While sometimes all we need is a quick change in our attitude to make things better, I would look to other titles for deeper issues.<P>Read and enjoy!</span>

                    <span>A true delight for anyone with even the least interest in unusual animal photograpy. Even aside from that, the captions and photos together are clever and provide a way to laugh at our own humanness.</span>

                    <span>Great animal pictures. One dog looked like a girl I knew. But the poems/captions seem rather trite and contrived. Its a nice coffee table book, but somewhat cheesy. I read it at my aunt's house. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy it.</span>
