                    <span>This book by Shilov covers the fundamentals in beginning analysis(both real and complex). It has in common with Walter Rudin's book (entitled 'Real and Complex Analysis') that it covers both real functions (integration theory and more), as well as Cauchy's theorems for analytic functions. Shilov's book is at an undergraduate level, and it can easily be used for self-study. The Dover edition is affordable. Rudin's book is for the beginning graduate level, and it is widely used in math departments around the world. Both books have stood the test of time.
<br />Comparison of Shilov with Rudin: Rudin's 'Real and Complex' has become an institution, and I have to admit I have loved it since I was a student myself, but conventional wisdom will have it that Shilov is a lot gentler on students, and much easier to get started with: It stresses motivation a bit more, the exercises are easier (some of Rudin's exercises are notorious, but I find the challenge charming--not all of my students do though!), and finally Shilov gets to touch upon a few applications; fashionable these days. But that part easily gets dated. I will expect that beginning students will enjoy Shilov's book.
<br />Personally, I find that with perseverance, students who keep at it with Rudin's book, will end up with a lot stronger foundation. They are more likely to have proofs in their blood. I guess Shilov can always serve as a leisurely supplementary reading to Rudin.
<br />There will never be another book like Rudin's 'Real and Complex', just like there will never be another van Gogh. But the fact that we love van Gogh doesn't prevent us from enjoying other paintings.

                    <span>As Shilov write in the introduction "I have tried to accomodate the interests of larger population of those concerned with mathematics" and at that he seems to do. However, the book does require some mathematical background as he appears to omit defining a few things. I believe the book would be ideal for those who want a handy reference, or an easier book when struggling with an analysis course.<p>However, for the more mathematically inclined readers, the problems are often too easy, and many things are proved that could be better left as exercises. For a more difficult Analysis book, I would reccomend Rudin.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book as a reference book for my first analysis course.  It is very well written, and easy to follow.  Dr. Shilov has a very nice way of organizing this text:  He puts all the definitions at the beginning of the chapter and the subsequent sections are results of those definitions.  It makes for a very quick reference.  His presentation of the included proofs is also very nice.  There were several occasions I found myself thumbing through it for a second perspecitve.  <p>As far as the actual material presented, Dr. Shilov starts off with funtions of one real variable, then rather quickly generalizes to complex variables and N dimensional functions, so you'll quickly see metric theory and some topology.  He does keep in mind this is intended for undergrads and first year grads though.<p>Oh, another nice feature is the price!  I'd recommend this book to any math enthusiast as a reference, or to someone going through an early analysis course.</span>

                    <span>Coherent and comprehensive, this "Elementary Real and Complex Analysis" is an emphatic introductory text, which will provide undergraduates with all the guides that they may need.<br>The presentation of this book is such that anybody who is taking Pure and/or Applied Mathematics course would value it. From Analysis Basics to Complex Functions, the authors of this book fulfilled every desire.<br>Worthy of mention is the way they simplified the rather complex Cauchy's Theorem. The same could be said of the chapters covering: Power Series Representations, Topology and Analysis in the Complex Plain, Holomorphic Functions, and Contour Integration.<br>Each topic that appeared in this book received accurate simplification. They are all object-oriented, and were designed to be of great use to self-learners.<br>Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>I study math for 4 years, so I think that I'm able to say if this book is good or bad. This book is excelent. If I am not a teacher on high school, but I'm interesting in mathematical analysis, this is the book what I need.  There is a lot of mathematic's basics, which are usefull in the later  courses as Funkcional Analysis or P.D.E.</span>
