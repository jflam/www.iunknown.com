                    <span>I'm a senior in an independent reading class. I enjoy action and adventure novels as well as mystery and non-fiction books. As you can tell this book is non fictional book that tells the life and tragedies of Tupac Amaru Shakur. This book gives all the information you need about the life Tupac led as well as followed.
<br />
<br />This book begins with giving background information on his mother and what she did and accomplished in her earlier years as a Black Panther. Not only was his mother a powerful and strong Black Panther but so was his father. His mother, Afeni Shakur, not only was a powerful and strong leader, but was also a motivational speaker.
<br />
<br />Tupac's childhood was both bad and good. He grew up poor with no money, always moving around from place to place, ghetto to ghetto. This was both good and bad because nobody in this world wants to be poor, but his experience in those situations made him a stronger person. As he grew up he had no confidence because he knew he had nothing important in his life. Confidence didn't come until he became famous as a rap artist. During his career Tupac also got into a lot of trouble that involved gangs, fights, drugs, and many other things that got him into either jail or the hospital. Those experiences gave him the knowledge to do what he does best which is to rap and share those experiences with others.
<br />
<br />Overall, most of the things Tupac did or accomplished in his life were for the good. Although he did bad things at times and got into trouble, the things he did helped people do certain things that they do today which is why this is a good book to read. This book helped me understand things in a different perspective.

                    <span>Tupac: Resurrection is an autobiography of the late Tupac Amaru Shakur. It's based on the documentary film with the same name. Although it's an autobiography, it's actually more like a biography. The book is written in his own true words. All you can read is actual quotes from him put together to tell the story of Tupac.
<br />
<br />His mother, Afeni Shakur, was sick and tired of watching people put together movies and write books trying to interpret Tupac's life, so she decided to make Tupac: Resurrection - The true story of Tupac. A documentary as true and real as it can get. The only person who knows how Tupac truly was like, must be himself, and the person who knows Tupac best after himself is most likely his mother. So she did the best she could and hired people to collect pictures, poems, lyrics, screenplay ideas, personal letters and most importantly quotes throughout Tupac's life.
<br />
<br />Here's a little note from Afeni Shakur that is written in the back of Tupac: Resurrection which pretty much explains how she feels about the book:
<br />
<br />"Tupac loved to read! Books were a constant part of his life. As much as Tupac loved to read, he enjoyed talking.
<br />
<br />From our earliest commitment to a documentary of Tupac Shakur's life, we had to allow Tupac to narrate his own journey through film. The embryo of this important book was already beginning to impose itself upon our production plans for the film. It was as if Tupac's spirit reminded us that he wanted to tell his own story not only on film, but in print. The film is a very powerful voice of Tupac, but an accompanying book was obviously unaviodable. Amaru's own Ms. Karolyn Ali went searching for publishers who would not distort our vision for this project. Thankfully, we did not have to search further than Judith Curr, who published Tupac's The Rose That Grew from Concrete. When Judith took over the helm at Atria, we became reenergized with her faith in our project.
<br />
<br />This book is a result of the work of many people. More importantly, the book is an extension of my son's thoughts, beliefs, and the way he viewed life! Thank you, Tupac, for sharing your world on film and in the pages of this book. We hope you are not disappointed.
<br />
<br />Love,
<br />
<br />Mom"
<br />
<br />The book lets you get under Tupac's skin and into his mind, and in some way you can actually relate to what he is saying, not because you might have been through it, but because you hear about most of it in the news every single day. Although all his music and all of his words are from the past, they still have a meaning today. The life he lived was a life of a caring and giving individual. He really reached out to his community and to the whole world.
<br />
<br />It was a true pleasure to read this book becaure I really got a good and intimate insight to Tupac's work and life. I strongly recommend this book to not only the ones who are devoted fans, but to everyone.
<br />
<br />It's the biography Tupac Amaru Shakur never got to write...</span>

                    <span>Oh wow I am one of the most avid Tupac Amaru Shakur fans you will ever meet. I have bought every single one of his DVD(including Juice, poetic justic, gridlock'd and gang related) his books (the rose that grew from concrete among others" and simply other documentaries and memoriabilia. He is a great and extremely talented man that managed much especially from growing up in the Baltimore ghettoes. This book, which was his "biography" is no that at all. It is merely a recollection of his life and past attributes. I must say that I was disappointed by the fact that this wasn't a biography. I must say though that how could I have expected a true biography out of a man that has been dead for 8 years almost. Although I still read this book and enjoyed it, I must rate it 4 stars. </span>

                    <span>First of all i would just like to say that Tupac was the most amazing himan being on earth. His music was excellent. Most people in the music industry just take from there music, but not Tupac, Tupac gave back to it. He wrote lyrics that made you understand the life of the ghetto. He didn't sing about cars and such like that. You had to understand him as a person before you can judge him. This book was wonderful. It even helps the most ignorant of all people understand Tupac and learn to love him. Tupac was ruthless becuase he had to be. If you're soft the world walks all over you. He portrayed the real side of the world through his music. The only reason many people hated on him was the fact that his music was so factual. Tupac did not and refused to rap about the world glories, because there isnt many to tell. The world is cold and who better to know it than somebody who the worlds prejudice against. It all comes with understanding. You cant not listen to his music and judge that its crap. You have to listen to it and pay attention to what hes saying. People who are ignorant wont even try to understand what hes saying. You cant expect somebody that has had a hard life to rap about the world being beautiful, becuase that they've seen and been through is not beautiful. When you understand you feel the emotions you project. I highly reccomend this book to people who dont understand Tupac. It shows the many sides of him, in his own words. Read the words, and in his own words "Only god can judge me, because you dont even know me". Dont talk about something you never experienced, and no nothing about, because being ignorant will get you no where but understanding will help you keep and open mind.<p>R.I.P to the greatest man ever, Tupac Amaru Shakur.<br>Who cared enough about his music to justify it and make it something we can listen when we are down</span>

                    <span>the book is a great way to sum up the late great Tupac Amaru Shakur. the book is one of the best books i've ever read. it shows you (the reader) how Tupac was not only a rapper but also a poet, artist, and an all around influence on any community. i have always been a Tupac fan but this book bought me closer to him. i can relate to his life's struggle because i've been there and just knowing that i'm not alone makes me feel better.  
  
  
 long live the greatest
