                    <span>While I am still a novice at working with the hexagrams, I was frustrated with trying to make sense of I Ching, until I found this workbook. Sometimes, it just takes a picture or a simple chart to make things clear.</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book for those not interested in deciphering the English translation, which can be most difficult.  It is straight forward, with all the information needed for imediate use.  It stirs your imagination to desire the highest ideals, and gives information on exacting those ideals or actions.  Years ago I studied an english version of the I Ching, but never understood it as clearly as I do now, and therefore only applied it to problems.  After reading the brief but concise info on how and why this book is used, I am applying it to all aspectds of life, living, my enviornment, and more; with ease and awe!</span>

                    <span>This book is indeed a Workbook for using the I Ching. There are so many books about the hexagrams, but not many go into enough detail as to how to really USE them from a practical perspective, and leave the reader to figure it out for him or herself. R.L. Wing's interpretations of each hexagram are more detailed than one usually finds. As the other reviews indicate, Wing keeps a impartial distance, however, and that requires the user to read between the lines to apply them to their own circumstances. <p>For each hexagram, he gives several paragraphs where one gives an interpretation if you're asking on a personal matter, another if the question has to do with career, another if your question is about family relationships, etc. For myself, I used it heavily when I found myself in a new job or with new acquaintances and found it to be extremely useful in navigating the political ups and downs and figuring out who to trust. I spent a while asking deeper and deeper questions into each area and it helped me to transform my professional relationships and find a more meaningful career. Thanks, R.L. Wing!</span>

                    <span>I've had this book for more than 20 years. It is in almost constant use.  It is truly like conversing with another entity.  I own many different copies of the "I Ching", but this is my most valued.  It is a beautiful translation and in keeping with the spirit of the "I Ching".</span>

                    <span>The I Ching workbook has a unique feature which allows you to track the appearance of the hexagrams in your readings.  The forms also allow you to track lines that change frequently in certain situations.  This is an excellent way to develop your thinking about certain aspects of your life.  I quite enjoy this feature, and it has helped greatly in my fledgling understanding of the hexagrams.<p>  That being said, R.L Wing's translation is rather dry and uninspiring.  It is intended to facilitate understanding, but the poetry which first attracted me to I Ching in the first place is eschewed in favor of prose dissertation.  That's precisley how it feels, as though someone had written an academic thesis on the hexagrams.  This, in my opinon, makes it extremely difficult to form an intuitive response to the text.<p>   Still, I reccomend the workbook simply for the journal feature.  You may or may not have the same response to the translation.  If you do, there are other translations that you can refer to, while still using the tracking feature to follow the influence of the hexagram.  Better still, combine insights from both translations.  A more poetic viewpoint actually helps render the thesis more inuitively intellegible.<p>   An excellent tool for exploring the hexagrams in your own life.</span>
