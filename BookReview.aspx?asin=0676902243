                    <span>This is a good book for getting an overview of where to go and what to do. It also does a good job of listing hotels (though it's not the best for lower end venues). The book is frustrating, however, in that the person who makes the maps does not seem to be coordinating his/her efforts with the person who writes the text. Maps list main streets, but not the ones where major hotels are located (except in the big cities). Hence, you have no idea if your hotel is near or far away from major sites. This is especially problematic for single travelers who might wish to favor a central location to minimize commute times and the troubles that accompany them. Also, there is some inconsistency in the text. A suggested "ideal" itinerary will exclude an item that is later listed in the text as a "must see." Perhaps the problem occurs when different reviewers provide updates for the guides and don't bother to read the existing text carefully. Is the book worth your time? Yes, for the early stages of planning a trip. But you will definitely need another guide for information that could easily have been provided here. Finally, the guide subscribes to the PC nonsense that has become so popular lately....they soft peddle important things like SAFETY tips. It's not being a wet rag to acknowledge that there are some serious safety concerns you must keep in mind....and spelling them out for each area.</span>

                    <span>When you're embarking on any big adventure, and India certainly is, you'd be foolish to rely on one guide, and this one is no exception. (Take a look at my review of Lonely Planet India). Fodor's is always pretty reliable when it comes to restaurants and hotels, especially if you're not a low budget traveller. Prices of course are usually out-of-date pretty quickly, and the exchange rate fluctuates all the time, but their "$$$" system gives a good idea of the relative costs of different places. I also like the "star" system highlighting sites to see--in a country chock-full of palaces, temples, forts, and natural wonders, it helps to prioritize if time is short. The maps of local areas are OK as you plan your trip, but of course no guide book has really good maps--pick one up as you arrive in a major city, and as you plan your itinerary around the country, a country map is critical. Fodors is, however, short on history and culture, and some reading before you go is critical. And remember--things change, particularly in a place like India--local knowledge from your hotel or guide (from a reputable company, not someone you stop on the street) is always the best bet.</span>

                    <span>Hello to fellow travellers to India.<P>I bought this 2000 edition of Fodor's India because I got a deal online, but found the book to be of very limited use.<P>One of the best features of this book is the recommendation of itineraries based on the number of days that you might spend in a neighborhood. For example, if you intend to visit the state of Tamil Nadu, the book recommends specific itineraries if you have 4 days, 7 days, or 10 days at your disposal. If such a feature is important to you, this may be a very satisfactory book for you. The section on travel tips is also a good one.<P>I found the book to lack in comprehensiveness. For example, if you intend to visit any places in Maharashtra other than Bombay (Mumbai) or the Ajanta, Ellora caves, you wont be able to find it in this book. The hotel and dining recommendations were also disappointing. We stayed at the beautiful Park guest house on the beach at Pondicherry and ate at wonderful Annalakshmi restaurant in Madras (Chennai). Neither was listed in Fodor's.<P>Another helpful feature that you find in other guides such as Footprint is the location of money changers (for foreign exchange) in any given city - a feature that you will not find in Fodor's.<P>If you are looking for historical details about locations, it is hard to beat the Blue guides. I was also impressed by the Rough guide and Footprint guide. The latter is especially good about including detailed maps of cities. (I got a chance to look at these various guides in a local library and would recommend to others that they look at as many guides as available in your local library before buying one to take with you to India.)<P>No matter which travel guide you use, I hope you have a great time in India!</span>
