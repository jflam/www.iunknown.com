                    <span>Richard Wright (1908-1960) describes his southern upbringing in this superb autobiographical tale.  Wright grew up in a fatherless home in Mississippi, where harsh Jim Crow segregation was the rule.  As a young black man, Wright endured abuses by arrogant white co-workers and was even hit with a bottle for failing to call a white man "sir."  Unhappy with the Jim Crow south, Wright left for Chicago where racial abuses were lesser, but poverty remained.  In Chicago Wright joined with communists in an uneasy association that he eventually ended.  This book makes for superb reading about youth and injustice, and displays Wright's stellar literary talent, although some see the book as fading a bit towards the end.

                    <span>Black Boy is the autobiography of the late Richard Wright. This book gives you a shining glimpse into one of the greatest writer's mind, and it is a book that you won't be quick to forget. Black Boy is not only an autobiography but a glimpse into racial, and social tensions and other problems in America   
<br />	
<br />This autobiography explains what shaped this great writer. Wright had a troubled childhood filled with a hunger for the basic need of food, and the never dying desire to live a free life, away from the South. His life was outlined by a mentally and physically damaging family. Growing up in a highly religious family Richard Wright found no belief in God, and he was constantly viewed as a horrible devilish child by his family. After enduring a childhood filled with trouble he saved enough money to leace the south and travel to Chicago.
<br />	
<br />In Chicago, Richard Wright, during the Great Depression, joined the Communist Party. Joining the Communist Party helped shape many of his political and social beliefs. He was the president of the John Reed Club, a faction of the Communist Party, in Chicago until he was suspected for working with authorities, because he had been compiling interviews with fellow Communist. Afterwards he left the Party and began to write full time, a dream he had had since childhood.
<br />	
<br />Black Boy is an insightful look into what makes a great writer. It's a must read even if you've never read anything by Richard Wright. This book not only takes a look into his life but the lives of African Americans trying to work their way up.</span>

                    <span>Very good memoir of Richard Wright's childhood growing up black in the south.  Book is divided into two sections, the first about young Wright in the South, and the second about his experiences as a young man in Chicago.
<br />
<br />Some brilliant writing, and heart-wrenching sequences when Wright is a young boy, facing the racism of the South, and dealing with poverty.  His love of books and writing is a fascinating journey to watch unfold.
<br />
<br />For me, the second part, "American Hunger" was not on the same par as the first, "Southern Night."  The focus here was largely on the Communist party, and not as enthralling for me.  Although the revelations of the politics of black communists was interesting. </span>

                    <span>This book is profound! It projects the life-story of an African American man-child in America during the early Twentieth century. Wright talks so frank and vividly about life as an African American and that of a man-child during a time of racial discord and divisions. Fear is etch upon every page. This book gripped me. It demonstrated such hunger. And assured hunger. Driven by desire. And intellect. Wright etches his a horror story the pages of his first written manuscript, a draft, that he shares with a neighbor female friend. Ahhh what a friend. If only she knew at the time for her light and enthusiasm a purpose was born into Wright.
<br />
<br />The thing that caught my eye while reading this book was not about how his life was in the beginning. It was hard. But what really captured me was how he described the writing of his first piece. He describe the glow of the young female neighbors eyes and the amazement and the light that shown when she was so impressed with his written "words". The light that shone in her eyes upon reading something that he made. That he constructed!
<br />
<br />From an educator's perspective whenever one can remember vivid details of one's life there's always a certain dividend of time that has been ascertain through trauma. Nevertheless, despite such a traumatic life he did remarkably well with what he had. He wrote. Which to me is a testimony to all and any writer. 
<br />
<br />Sometimes life can be filled with such an intensity of tragedy and discord that all one can do is promise oneself a memoir of sorts. . .  To mark the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, and even years in which one had to endure such dreadful things. Because the rain can fall and is falling so hard in a life that one can nearly drown in their own tears.
<br />
<br />Rain did fall in Richard Wright's life but he wrote truth from his heart. . . And thus, the legend.</span>

                    <span>Richard Wright, known primarily as the archetypal author of Native Son, has written his most endearing work (in my opinion) in Black Boy.  Although he received financial security and immense critical acclaim upon the advent of Native Son, it was, however, Black Boy that firmly cemented his name amongst the civil rights pioneers of the 1940's.  
<br />
<br />Is it merely a racial coming of age book? NO.  It is, without question, infinitely more than that.  It would be doing the book a grave disservice to merely pigeonhole it in that category.  Black Boy, whether you want to label it an autobiographical novel or a semi-fictional autobiography, provocatively enthralls and envelops the reader into young Richard's tangled web of racial injustice, coming of age, and more importantly, self-actualization.  
<br />
<br />As we follow young Richard from his young formative years in rural Mississippi to Memphis to Chicago, we feel as if we grow with him and are rooting for him all the while to succeed and to grow both physically (from his almost constant lack of food) and mentally (his insatiable appetite for knowledge is something we all can learn from).  
<br />
<br />Although I enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book the most (the ending was somewhat abrupt and the tales of his involvement with the Communist group in Chicago were not as engaging as those in the beginning), I came away both impressed and enlightened from reading this life account of a time and place so vastly different from today's society, yet not as far removed as some would have you think.    </span>
