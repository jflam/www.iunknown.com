                <span id="Label1">In the preface to <I>A Moveable Feast</I>, Hemingway remarks casually that "if the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction"--and, indeed, fact or fiction, it doesn't matter, for his slim memoir of Paris in the 1920s is as enchanting as anything made up and has become the stuff of legend. Paris in the '20s! Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley, lived happily on $5 a day and still had money for drinks at the Closerie des Lilas, skiing in the Alps, and fishing trips to Spain. On every corner and at every caf&eacute; table, there were the most extraordinary people living wonderful lives and telling fantastic stories.  Gertrude Stein invited Hemingway to come every afternoon and sip "fragrant, colorless alcohols" and chat admid her great pictures. He taught  Ezra Pound how to box, gossiped with  James Joyce, caroused with the fatally insecure  Scott Fitzgerald (the acid portraits of him and his wife,  Zelda, are notorious). Meanwhile, Hemingway invented a new way of writing based on this simple premise: "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know."<p>  Hemingway beautifully captures the fragile magic of a special time and place, and he manages to be nostalgic without hitting any false notes of sentimentality. "This is how Paris was in the early days when we were very poor and very happy," he concludes. Originally published in 1964, three years after his suicide, <I>A Moveable Feast</I> was the first of his posthumous books and remains the best. <I>--David Laskin</I></span>

                    <span>Whether his stories were fact or fiction, reliable or unreliable, Hemingway had always presented excellent reading material. This small book is a classic piece of literature representing his experiences as a young, starving writer in Paris during the 1920s.
<br />
<br />The direction of his writing and personal life was determined from his interrelationships during that time in Paris. His insightful and exuberant moods of that time created an unquenchable enthusiasm within him for the rest of his life no matter where he was or what he did. Long live Ernest Hemingway...who by the way was an acquaintance of mine; while living in Florida I had once wrestled him in a bar over a beer.</span>

                    <span>My God, if you're a writer or hoping to be -- you will love this book! These are sketches of Hemingway's early days in Paris as he joined other expatriate writers and artists living there. Need I say more? How about that he recalls meeting the likes of Ezra Pound, Getrude Stein, Scott Fitzgerald, and that the writing is quite beautifully understated and so easy to read. This book was suggested to me in the back of another terrific book called THE LOSERS' CLUB: Complete Restored Edition -- also about artist and writers but set in pre-9/11 downtown New York City. Anyway, pick up A MOVEABLE FEAST and THE LOSERS CLUB -- both books will stroke your fantasies of being a creative person. Both books are also intensely entertaining and compulsively readable. Take my word for it you won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorites of Hemingway's work.  It is a easy read, almost light when compaired with Hemingway's other work.  Of course the brilliant word crafting is still there but I found it more enjoyable that some of his other work.  I have never been a big fan on Hemingway novels, preferring his short stories, but do make an exception with this one. I enjoy works which address this time period and place, and here we have a first hand account by one of the principle players.  To be fare though, you really need to read some of the memoirs of some of the others written of that period.  Hemingway did probably have some axes to grind, but hey, who dosen't?  All in all recommend this one highly. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a thoroughly nasty book. Not a celebration of Paris or anything else, but rather an attempt by an aging and embittered man to settle scores (imaginary and otherwise) against people no longer able to defend themselves. 
<br />
<br />Take the chapter on Ford Madox Ford. Hemingway was well aware that Ford was the superior novelist, but rather than confront him on that level, he makes a point of mentioning Ford's horribly foul breath. The heroic ambulance driver fails to add that Ford's lungs were nearly destroyed in a gas attack while he was leading troops in the trenches. Very classy, particularly since Ford's injuries later killed him. 
<br />
<br />Similarly, Hemingway bends over backwards to make it seem that something of Lovecraftian depravity was going on between Gertrude and Alice, while presenting no evidence whatsoever. You don't have to be a radfem or a Stein idolater either to find this obnoxious.
<br />
<br />And on it goes, one chapter after another, almost without relief. It's difficult to grasp what readers see in this thing. I can only surmise that they've been blinded by Hemingway's genius. Though in point of fact, there's little enough of that in evidence here. This book was written by the man who wrote so gloatingly of rotting "Kraut" corpses during World War II. If you want the artist who changed fiction writing so profoundly and permanently, you'll have to look to the early novels and collections.</span>

                    <span>this anyway. It's wonderful,poignant,gossipy, and a must for anyone who fantasizes about Paris in the 1920's. It is a fast read, and very revealing about what was going on in Hemingway's head before he died. His goal as a young writer was to write just one true sentence a day, and in this fascinating book, he achieved much more than that. I take back all the rude things I ever said about him as a writer, and maybe I'll go back and have another look at some of his other books.</span>
