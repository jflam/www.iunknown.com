                    <span>I should have read more reviews before buying this book. It was about 2 pages of writing and the rest pictures. All the pictures looked like they could have all been taken at one run, because you see the same guys over and over. Also it's not a book of a few 1%er clubs as the title might have you think, but only OUTLAWS mc. Don't waste your money.</span>

                    <span>The best pictoral review from an outsiders point of view that I've ever seen!!! An all picture book which needs no words. The photographer (Michael H. Upright) has captured the Biking and Brotherhood world at it's best without being a patched member! Thanks to the Outlaws MC1%ers for this inside look at the best biking and brotherhood organization in the world!...</span>

                    <span>Michael Upright's One Percent is a captivating book for a number of reasons. <p>First of all, the book offers a rare view inside the world of the Outlaws. People outside the biker community seldom (if ever) gain close  access to this type of club. The intimacy reflected in Upright's photos is  proof that he succeeded in gaining the group's trust. He earned it. This  isn't tabloid voyeurism. This is an objective look at a complex group. The  Outlaws are very much human in Upright's portraits.<p>The photographs  themselves are stunning. For those who love motorcycles, the book is an  homage to bikes and bikers. For those who aren't particularly into bikes,  you will be. Upright's photos make these machines look like trophies of the  American highway.<p>Finally, the photographs are spectacularly reproduced.  I am often disappointed by the quality of photography books--the photos  appear dull and somewhat lifeless. The photos in One Percent are clean,  clear and crisp. I enjoy the incredible detail more with every read.<p>I  highly recommend One Percent. It's a fascinating look into the fringe of  society as told through the lens of a skilled photographer.</span>
