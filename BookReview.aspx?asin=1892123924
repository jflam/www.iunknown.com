                    <span>Andrea Nierenberg has been called the "Queen of Networking" for good reason. Her book and advice is solid. It provides useful tips and strategies that anyone can utilize. I loved it so much; I bought another copy and gave it to a friend. 
<br />
<br />Long live the Queen!</span>

                    <span>I've found Andrea's book Nonstop Networking an invaluable tool as a management consultant.  The book is a very quick read, to the point, and a great reference.  Andrea also reaffirmed my belief that networking is a way of life, and not a means to an end (the norm).  The book also provided numerous examples of how to go about categorizing your network of contacts, staying in touch with your network, and provided real live examples or situations that I could easily identify with.  Although, I'm not at the level that Andrea's is, I can attribute much of my recent personal success in networking to her book "Nonstop Networking", and my drive to be a better person, and I regularly recommend her book to others who are either just starting out, or have lost there way.

                    <span>Andrea's Nonstop Networking is absolutely the best networking "How To" book written.  It sits on my desk as a reference to use the rest of my life - personally and professionally.  By changing my perspective from "What can I get from this?" to "How can I add to this?" her book takes what can seem to be a very daunting task, building lasting relationships, and breaks them into simple tasks that everyone can do everyday.  In Nonstop Networking, Andrea organizes the simple things and explains why they make all the difference.  Most importantly, her method works.  Try it.</span>

                    <span>Andrea's book on nonstop networking is not only very informative, it is a very easy read with lots of real-life examples.  Of all the networking books I've read, this one is the benchmark by which all others should be measured.  Again, it is simple, straightforward, easy-to-read, full of great examples without all the extraneous words in so many books today.  Reading this book makes you want to get better at networking and do so right away.  I've recommended it to my friends and family as the one book to read on networking.</span>
