                    <span>...I bought this book to make plans for a trip to Zambia but the chapter about this country is only 40 pages long, both verbose and superficial.  Don't get fooled by the "Adventuring" in the title, unless your idea of adventure is to hop by plane from lodge to lodge at $200 or $300 a night.  More importantly, except for the park entrance fees, this book doesn't list any price at all (I got them from two other, excellent, travel guides).  Comments on cheaper accomodations are few and disenchanted.  The maps are equally few and over-simplified (the roads don't even appear!...)  Finally, I looked at the chapters about the other countries and it certainly didn't change my opinion about this book.  Note also that the date of the last edition (October 97) makes it relatively outdated.</span>

                    <span>This book is full of interesting and pertinent travel information; it is a MUST for anyone interested in game-viewing and travelling in southern Africa. The author gives best times to travel depending on what you want to  see, and for each country, lists brief history/present politics, places to  stay--easily accessible to remote--and how to get there and what you may  see. He also gives a comprehensive packing list, medical info, and tips on  game viewing. Out of the 4 books I bought on southern Africa, this is the  one I referred to most often. This book, coupled with The Kingdon Field  Guide to African Mammals, is an invaluable southern Africa traveller's  necessity.</span>

                    <span>Prior to my trip, I purchased 4 travel books on Southern Africa then found this guidebook at the Miami airport. It was by far the most accurate and contained all the "need to know" information. Unlike the others,  it contained excellent hotel and activity descriptions plus gave detailed  information on each region. Sure you want to know some local history but  I'm more interested in where to stay, where to eat and what things I can  do. At the end of the trip, I left my first 4 guidebooks in Botswana and  brought this one home!</span>
