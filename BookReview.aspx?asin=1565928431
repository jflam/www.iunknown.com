                    <span>This book is not for the complete ASP beginner, but for someone wanting an introduction and reference to the objects (e.g., request, response, session) and components (e.g., ad rotator, page counter, file access). Although the examples in this book are in VBScript this book should not be thought of as a reference for VBScript. Though short, the examples were enough to start me using the features, for example setting a session timeout, using a collections reference or sending email from a script. I did find the examples on the ActiveX Data Objects a little sparse and the author admits, "there are several more advanced topics". I had previously found the global.asa file and #include files somewhat mysterious so this chapter was helpful. <P>With the availability of online documentation, I found the author advise about using the feature or limitations more valuable than details of the parameters. There is enough of an introduction to give you the concepts in most areas. Additionally the specification of what driver is needed for a component can be helpful if there are problems. I will continue to use this book in conjunction with online documentation.</span>

                    <span>Overall this is a good reference book. Note that its not a tutorial book, so if you're looking for a tutorial on ASP scripting, then you should probably get another book.<P>While reading through this book I did notice a few minor errors, having to do with the core HTTP protocol, but I didn't notice any errors in the parts having to do with ASP.<P>Some material is repeated throughout, especially the explanation of object properties that are collections, but this is to be expected in a reference work. In a reference you want each section to be able to stand on its own, so some repetition is necessary.</span>

                    <span>Somewhat in a rush and while trying to learn ASP I purchased this book. I thought it was aweful and it collected dust for nearly 6 months while I searched elsehwere to boot myself up on ASP. However, now that I'm fairly proficient at ASP, this book has been helpful as a reference. No so much for the actual reference value but becasue the sample code helps put things in perspective.</span>

                    <span>I was an ASP programmer several years ago after which I moved to a different technology. Now, I need to come to speed on .NET, but unfortunately all the ASP.NET books make innumerous references to the old ASP which I have almost forgotten.<P>The book helped me *VERY* quickly go through ASP 3.0 and now I feel very comfortable reading the .NET books and can now truly appreciate ASP.NET.<P>A GREAT reference book!</span>

                    <span>Be warned, if like I did, you think that this is the only book you'll need to be able to build ASP scripts; you're very much mistaken. Whenever I recommend this book, I always recommend it alongside VBScript in a Nutshell as you really need knowledge of an ASP supported scripting language before you can use ASP in a Nutshell to it's full potential!<P>This is yet another reference book that I've owned both editions of because I thought it was useful enough to update; but then, my site is developed using ASP, so I'm probably biased in this respect. Ok, so I got the 1st Edition late on in the game and was a little reluctant to part with cash for the new edition - but as IIS 5 started to become standard for Windows hosting, and I had access to it after getting Windows XP Pro... I thought it was about time I updated it.<P>ASP in a Nutshell is my first point of reference when I'm looking up the properties of a particular ASP object. I've also found it an invaluable guide for connecting and manipulating ASP scripts that used ADO for data storage and manipulation. For a while it was the only book I owned that covered the issue of connecting ASP scripts to databases.<P>Most of the installable components I'd never heard of before getting the book, just as well really because few are of much use - even if they aren't available on your system, a lot can be easily reproduced. The areas I find myself most frequently refering to are the main set of ASP objects, the FileSystem Object and the ActiveX Data Objects. These go into enough detail to keep all but the experienced programmers happy.<P>For those new to the Windows scene, there is a brief but detailed guide to setting up ASP to work with your IIS server; but it's hardly rocket science since a clean install of IIS will set up most (if not all) of what you need anyway! If you use ASP regularly, or you intend to, then ASP in a Nutshell should be on your desktop... but please remember it won't fulfill all your ASP development needs without another book to fill in the language gaps. What book you choose to accompany it depends on your language and experience... I personally like VBScript in a Nutshell.</span>
