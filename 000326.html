<p>I've spent the past few days writing a sample application. It demonstrates a secure call chain from a <span class="caps">COM</span>+ serviced component back through to an <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> web application. When I started thinking about authentication, a bunch of alarms went off in my head. Let me tell you why.</p>

<p>I've always had a problem with the dynamic compilation model of <span class="caps">ASP.NET. </span>Part of it was the build problem, or put differently, how do you know whether your <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> pages actually compile? In the current implementation, <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> pages that contain &lt;script runat="server"&gt; blocks are unknowns in your build process.</p>

<p>Now that I've been spending some time with Code Access Security (yes, I am late to the game) I've been increasingly worried about malicious <span class="caps">INTERNAL</span> users changing my <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> pages to lure my secure infrastructure into doing bad things.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, this innocent looking piece of code:</p>

<code><pre>

GenericIdentity evilIdentity = new GenericIdentity("EvilDoer"); 
GenericPrinicpal evilPrincipal = new GenericPrincipal(identity, new string[] {"Admin"}); 
Thread.CurrentPrincipal = evilPrincipal;

App.DoHighlyPrivilegedStuff();

</pre></code><p>In <span class="caps">ASP.NET V1.1,</span> both High and Medium trust applications enable the <code>SecurityPermission.ControlPrincipal</code> permission. This lets any piece of code twiddle with the current principal on the current thread. What's worse, anyone who can replace an .aspx page in my application could potentially write the above code fragment.</p>

<p>But, you say, why can't I simply do a <code>StrongNamePermission</code> link demand against the caller? The problem is this: dynamically compiled .aspx pages cannot be strong-named. Period. This makes it impossible for me to sandbox my code that sets <code>Thread.CurrentPrincipal</code> in a more privileged place (like the <span class="caps">GAC</span>) and Assert <code>SecurityPermission.ControlPrincipal</code> without worrying about luring attacks like the one that I show above. I cannot limit the scope of who can call me, which makes it impossible to securely do the Assert().</p>

<p>There is an answer, however. Instead of using the .aspx infrastructure, I wrote the authentication piece as an <code>HttpHandler</code>. This way, I could compile it into a strongly-named assembly, and perform link demands against the identity of that assembly from my code that sets <code>Thread.CurrentPrincipal</code>.</p>

<p>I've decided to post my work-in-progress here to get some feedback. The work isn't complete yet; I still have to serialize my list of roles to / from the <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> authentication ticket and write the <code>HttpModule</code> that reads these roles and sets <code>Thread.CurrentPrincipal</code>. </p>

<p>If you want to download the source code, <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/Files/Security.zip">click here</a>. You will need to copy the <code>web_securetrust.config</code> file into <code>%.NET SYSTEMDIR%\CONFIG</code>. You will also need to create a new virtual directory called <code>\dev\demos\Security\Web</code> to run the sample. Finally, you'll need to add the <code>MACHINE\ASPNET</code> account to the <span class="caps">COM</span>+ application's <code>TrustedRoles</code> Role. </p>

<p>As you can see, installing a beast like this is really nasty as well. I'm going to be working really hard over the next few months on trying to solve that problem as well.</p>

<p>Comments / criticisms welcome.</p>

<p>You pain threshold is amazingly high.  I'm impressed.</p>

<p>I think the more you dig, the more security problems in ASP.NET you will unearth.  It's probably better that you unearth them then someone with more sinister intentions, but it would be best overall if no one ever dug too deeply.  Wasn't Windows theoretically more secure before all these people decided they wanted the publicity involved with making Microsoft squirm by finding critical security flaws?</p>

<p>It's impossible to completely secure any piece of hardware or software.  ASP.NET is not immune to that truism and in fact it has several exceedingly difficult to secure usage requirements built in.</p>

<p>Just pondering how to secure my ASP.NET applications from denial of service attacks is enough for me to reach my pain threshold which is obviously much lower than yours.</p>

<p>Enjoy your project.  I know I find reading about it entertaining.</p>

<p>I downloaded the code.  I am not sure of the results you desire from the ServicedComponent derived component.  I believe that you want to block access to the component based on membership in the TrustedRoles role.  But the User property is static and it does not instantiate the Serviced Component thus no component access checks.  The LinkDemand does work although.  I came up with a few more use case scenarios and coded them up.  I will send them to you directly in a zip file.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting study.</p>

<p>Also notice in the PostBuildEvent.bat I have modified it a bit for the Service Component.  I have noticed in the past that if I don't use the /if option of GacUtil that my COM+ component doesn't truly refesh.  I didn't even realize that the PostBuildEvent.bat existed until I was analyzing this project.   I must have missed this when making the transition to Visual Studio 2003.  Maybe a script hook can be put into the Handler component to recycle aspnet_wp.exe each time it is recompiled. </p>
