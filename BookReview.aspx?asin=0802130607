                    <span>Good men who live have karma of a dove.  It is 242 choruses, 242 poems.  As is everything written by Kerouac, it is autobiographical.  How can Mexico have a positive association in Beat history when William Burroughs killed his wife there in a William Tell experiment?  Anything by Kerouac was edited and promoted by Allen Ginsberg and for that reason alone a book of poems with Mexico in the title is of interest.  <p>Thinking of comfortable thoughts is what modern society has branded loafing is a line in one of the poems.  Zen provides much of the impetus for the collection of poems.  Kerouac's work manages to create an atmosphere of tropical vegetation and light.  The work is free-form and jazz-like.   <p>Automatic writing?  Well, maybe not automatic writing precisely.  Certainly the word-play and the fluidity remind the reader of Gertrude Stein.  (Mention Gertrude Stein and here we are at chorus 31.)  <p>I like the prose better, but I like the idea of the book and the arrangement.  The Beats stood for blessedness and freedom.  MEXICO CITY BLUES is an appropriate manifestation of Beat ideology.  Fifty first Chorus says America is a permisible dream, a Whitmanesque expression.<p>This is a celebration of other people.  I count Gregory Corso, William Carlos Williams, Oscar Wilde, Alexander Pope, Benjamin Franklin, William Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, the aforesaid Gertrude Stein, Charley Parker, Nin and Ma, Pa or Leo Alcide Kerouac, brother Gerard, Thurber, Baudelaire, Jolson, Miles, Sarah Vaughn, Chagall, Whitman, Melville, Mark Twain, Einstein, Plato, Moses, Aristotle, Joe Louis, Spinoza, James Huneker, Alfred Knopf, H.L. Mencken, David, Picasso, Jesus, Proust, Freud, Glenn Miller, Allen Ginsberg, St. Francis, Siddhartha, Virgin Mary.</span>

                    <span>I have been a Kerouac fan for a long time, but it was a couple of years after reading most his novels that I was able to get into his poetry. "Pomes all sizes", for example, sat unread on my bookshelf for some time. "Mexico City Blues" is what really turned me on to his poetry and made me able to appreciate it. I was able to go back and read his other petry with new eyes.  This book is fantastic.  Read it out loud to yrself, the man had a natural knack for rhythm.  Great book.</span>

                    <span>I remember when I first stumbled across this book in the early 90's- it was like Christmas came twice that year. You see, I had thought that I had read absolutely everything published by Kerouac, prose and poem. I didn't know this existed, Wow! It is like one long, magnificent blues or jazz riff of the written word. It is a true blues composition because it has genuine soul. The more I think about it, it just might be the best thing that he ever did. <br>I know this is going to sound outrageous, but the only comparable book of American poetry I can even think of comparing this to would be Whitman's _Leaves of Grass_. Whitman and Kerouac both sang of the same grass roots, mystical, America. And it's still out there, if you shake your mind free of the preconceptions and the [junk]....</span>

                    <span>It took me a while to get beyond the Beat myth and see these poems for what they are--some of the most joyful, goofy and affecting writings of the last century.  Jack wrote all 242 choruses--one per notebook page--over six weeks in 1955.  His improvised word-jazz was at its peak;  the poems are fresh and spontaneous but rarely sloppy (try it yourself if you don't believe me).  The Buddhist leanings are a little simple-minded, but simplicity is part of the point.  In layout and verbal inventiveness Jack's more experimental than most poets writing today.  He combines a love for made-up words and language as pure sound with a lyrical directness that you find more often in pop songs than modern poetry.  Hearing Jack read some of these on the Steve Allen record made me realize how rare a thing his poems achieved: sentiment, experiment, tenderness, peace.  A moving companion to On the Road.</span>

                    <span>a mix of cultures... musical styles.. not to say of alcohol, morphine,  etc... Jack fell sick on his trip to Mexico city, and he's looking for  healing, salvation- i believe he found it, with all the shots of morphine  he received at the hospital , with the mexican pulque and tequilla , and  other substances .. regardless it is a masterpiece of poetry. play some  "bird" in the background and enjoy!<p>"And I am only an  Apache -- Smoking Ashy -- In Old Cabashy -- By the Lamp!"</span>
