                <span id="Label1">Stalingrad, the bloodiest battle in the history of warfare, cost the lives of nearly two million men and women. It signaled the beginning of the end for Adolph Hitler and foretold the juggernaut that would destroy Berlin and make the Soviet Union a superpower. The author, William Craig, interviewed hundreds of survivors of the battle, both Russian and German, and has woven their incredible experiences into the fabric of hitherto unknown documents. The resulting tapestry is epic in scope and awesome in its depiction of heroism and tragedy.</span>

                    <span>Schoolboys talk about it, armchair historians love to dissect it.<BR>This is easily the best of the Stalingrad books - not a novel but the historical record written in muscular prose that the great war chroniclers like Harrison Salisbury and Cornelius Ryan trademarked. Superb insight on the white heat of the battle, of how this was a culminating battle where animal hatreds would decide one of hisotory's turning points. <P>This is considerably more readable and less cluttered than Antony Beevor's volume. It is definitive history that seems to settle the arguments of revisionists about what might have been. This time, not even Manstein could have saved them. The front was vulnerable in too many places. The Russians would win. <P>The real story is just how Manstein pulled off the extrication of the rest of the southern German forces, which military logic would have seemed were next victims after the anihilation of the Sixth Army. And he followed up this mephistophlean feat with the astonishing Kharkov counter - attack that sent the Russians reeling. <P>There's lots of great history surrounding Stalngrad. This book is the place to start and finish on the battle, then readers can move on to the real death knel - Operation Bagration. Books on this (which signalled the real collapse) are rarer but Amazon usually has a reasonably priced volume or two in its listings.</span>

                    <span>Enemy at the Gates, A Battle for Stalingrad, by William Craig brought out the truth. He described one of the bloodiest battles in World War II through the eyes of the people in it, not ones that looked at it after. This is one of the many books I have read about World War II, among even more about military acts, but it left a deep mark behind, even after the black back cover was seen. It caused such a deep impact on me. It made me feel that these people were role models, they inspired me to courageous and believe that I should have hope, for they did. The book did this because William Craig brought in stories of the people in there, but he didn¡¦t use it as an excerpt, but as part of his words. He brought in what I thought were imagination about war, to be cold hard facts about war. Another reason why I liked this book was that he never grew soft like some of the authors do. When an infantry hops in with this left leg in this hand, he described it well. He never lets you out on any fact or story about this battle.<BR>	I also like this book because he had touched me like no other book had. Many books left you with hatred on why humans were so stupid on having wars, but he didn¡¦t. After you finished the book, you feel that you want to help those trapped men. You want to help them meet their wives, kiss their kids. He does not create an atmosphere with a feeling you should have, but he tells you the facts about the men, reads you their letters of despair, writes the quotes of worried captains and allow you to feel the way you will feel. He touched me using the words of the people there, not of his, but survivors amongst the thousands of victims. He touched my heart, and after reading this book, I too, feel more proud and feel that even in the worse should I have hope.</span>

                    <span>This is easily the best WWII book Ive read. It explains the battle for stalingrad with great detail and it is non-bias.<BR>Craig has the ability to 'write' which most historians in this genre dont. He keeps the story flowing and doesnt fill in gaps with gobblyguk. I enjoyed this book and I enjoyed the companion movie as well.</span>

                    <span>Enemy at the Gates is a classic military book written about the epic World War II Battle of Stalingrad, fought in 1942-1943 between the superpowers of the time - Hitler's Germany and Stalin's U.S.S.R. The author interviewed a lot of survivors from both sides, including soldiers, doctors and civilians and obtain invaluable insight into the battle which significantly influenced the outcome of the war. For the first time, Nazi Germany had been crushed in a battle.<P>The book describes how in 1942, the German Sixth Army, fresh from crushing victories inflicted on the Allies across Europe, advanced deep into U.S.S.R. in an attempt to capture Stalingrad. Though out-numbered, the Russian army heroically fought back and held Stalingrad against a much more powerful enemy. Eye-witness accounts of the horrors of the initial bombings, the brutality of the fighting were described. The Russians were slowly pushed back and victory for the Germans seemed just a matter of time before the Russian reinforcements came in and encircled the Germans in Stalingrad, cutting supply lines for an army with almost 300,000 men. <P>The Germans quickly ran out of food and ammunition as the Russians encirclement grew tighter and tighter. The book detailed how the German High Command was bullish about delivering enough supplies to the troops inside the encirclement (even predicting a victory) and the politics and individual misjudgements which lead to the diaster that followed. <P>At this point, no matter what your opinions on the Germans are, you will feel sorry for the German troops trapped in the encirclement, slowly weakening and dying due to hunger, unable to launch counterattacks due to lack of supplies, waiting for the inevitable diaster to come. <P>The final chapter also describes the surrender and the fate of hundreds of thousands of German, Romanian and Italian prisoners of war. Only a small percentage of these troops saw their home countries again as they were killed or starved to death. Survivors of the prison camps described in horror how some of their countrymen had to resort to cannibalism to survive. <P>At the back of the book is a short chapter describing the fate of some of the survivors of the battle. I found this section to be quite interesting to see how the people involved in this battle ended up. <P>The only thing I find lacking in this book is detailed maps showing how the battle evolved from the initial German advances to the final destruction of the Sixth Army. <P>I strongly recommend this book to you.</span>

                    <span>i just finished this book today, as the "war" in iraq is ongoing. this is not my first book on stalingrad, i've read several others as well, and let me tell you, this has got to be the ultimate story of human struggle and survival. to lend some more credence to my review, i should add that i served several years in the canadian army, and i know what it's like to be cold, tired and hungry.<P>this book is less about the war, and quite simply put, more about what men will do to survive as they are exposed to a horrific environment. during my military training, i was routinely subjected to periods of 3-7 days with little sleep, less than enough food, and extremely cold conditions. i may have felt badly about this, but i knew that at the end of it all, i would be going home. the germans (i use them, because that's what this book is really about) in stalingrad suffered a thousandfold more and were never certain that they would survive (at least after things started going badly for them).<P>the stories of cannibalism, while only a small part of the book, are very gripping. the lengths men would go to, to get on a flight home are outlined here, even something so heart-wrenching as an italian soldier in captivity being beaten by the russians for speaking out about something, and for good measure, the russians killing the puppy that had accompanied him before and during his trek into captivity. the whole thing is so sad.....<P>a really great book. makes you want to go out and find some of these men yourself and speak to them just to get a firsthand account.<P>one last thing i wanted to say.... battles such as stalingrad will never happen again. this was a battle of attrition that took an awesome human and material toll. this was when war was war, man against man, man against nature, man against himself. These men deserve our respect for what they faced.</span>
