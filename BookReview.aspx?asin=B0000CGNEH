                <span id="Label1">For earthbound humans, <I>Winged Migration</I> is as close as any of us will get to sharing the sky with our fine feathered friends. It's as if French director Jacques Perrin and his international crew of dedicated filmmakers had been given a full-access pass by Mother Nature herself, with the complete "cooperation" of countless species of migrating birds, all answering to eons of migratory instinct. The film is utterly simple in purpose, with minimal narration and on-screen titles to identify the wondrous varieties of flying wildlife, but its visceral effect is humbling, awesome and magnificently profound. Technically, Perrin surpasses the achievement of his earlier film <I>Microcosmos</I> (which did for insects what this film does for birds), and apart from a few digital skyscapes for poetic effect, this astonishing film uses no special effects whatsoever, with soaring, seemingly miraculous camera work that blesses the viewer with, quite literally, a bird's-eye view. A brief but important hunting scene may upset sensitive viewers and children, but doesn't stop <I>Winged Migration</I> from being essential all-ages viewing. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>I originally reviewed this when it came out in the theaters, and now that I've experienced the DVD, I'm even more concerned. As many reviewers here have noted (to their peril!), this is not a National Geographic documentary. It is not agenda free. This vehicle is freighted with all kinds of "messages," so much so that the beauty of the birds gets caught in the net of earnestness.<P>No one can deny that the visual images presented to us in "Winged Migration" are breathtaking and unforgettable. What is forgettable is the narration that Perrin forces upon the images. In an apparent attempt to give the film some kind of symmetry or narrative arc, Perrin tries to tie it all together with insightful commentary.<P>There is literally nothing interesting in the narration nor is there any information offered that any high school science student couldn't offer as well. What's worse, there seems to be a "birds good, people bad" message underlying all of this.<P>Another annoyance is the effort to unite all these species of birds in the concept of migration. Honestly, can you honestly compare penguins and parrots with geese and finches? They may all be birds, but their stories and journeys are remarkably different.<P>The computer animation seems out of place as well, feeling like another attempt by the filmmakers to make the footage fit together. So much of it seems like an after-thought. The selection of which birds to include seems haphazard. Sure, they all look good on film, but is there truly anything unifying beyond, "They're all birds and they move from place to place."<P>The images don't need much commentary at all. The graphics tell us what bird is being featured and how far it travels. The commentary misses the most interesting aspects of the footage, namely the community of birds that we witness on the screen. Why try to extract a unifying theme at all. Lose the narrator and the "story" and just let the birds fly (or swim).<P>See this film for the beautiful images of birds in flight, but you'll have to forgive the awkward and contrived human element.</span>

                    <span>I've seen a lot of bird migration documentaries on PBS and Cable TV and I was concerned this film would be merely a big screen adaptation of those same films, but this is something more, much more. It's a superlative documentary about bird migration boasting the most fantastic aerial camera work of birds in flight ever seen. A minimal amount of narration allows the wonder of bird flight to be seen as if from a child's viewpoint of awe inspiring images so startling one is filled with momentary disbelief. The naked camera eye watches as a bird beats it's wings in flight with such physical endurance, one can't help but almost feel it's heart beating to the rhythm of it's effort. I believe it was a flock of colorful Rose-Breasted Geese that the camera documented flying through a bleak industrial European city like an other wordly beauty against a Fritz Lang 'Metropolis' urban landscape. I loved the soundtrack music, some of it co-written by rock icon Nick Cave. It was just weird enough to offset the intensity of the natural science of migration. Only quibble, why not humor us and save that poor broken-winged shore bird eaten alive be gigantic sand crabs? I know this isn't Disney but it's also not your run of the mill cold nature film. This is the second film I've seen this year, the other being "Standing In The Shadows of Motown", in which the audience burst into spontaneous applause as the last credit rolled.</span>

                    <span>Too many people have taken the time to bash this exquisite and wonderful film that celebrates the avian life on earth. I, for one, take offense to their lies and misleading "facts". First of all, there are TWO bird-hunting scenes in the film. One takes place in the Adirondack Mountains of New York and involves snow geese and the other takes place in a marsh somewhere in EUROPE and involves greylag geese.<P>Second, to obtain the spectacular footage for the film, the birds shown in the film HAD to be IMPRINTED. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to film them up-close on their migration routes. Which wild birds do you know of that would let filmmakers fly close to them while they are flying their migration routes? Answer that, critics of the film!!!!<P>Third, the birds were taken to a wildlife sanctuary in Normandy, France, after the filming was over. They are taken care of by seven workers.<P>This film is GORGEOUS and all bird lovers should see it. Ignore the people who feel compelled to bash it.<P>After having read Errol Fuller's book "Extinct Birds", I felt lucky and honored to be able to see up close and personal today's birds in wonderful flight. Fuller's book contains illustrations and descriptions of so many EXTINCT birds that it saddened me. Watching "Winged Migration" has uplifted my spirits. Man has caused the extinction of at least 75 bird species since the year 1600. Be glad that a small percentage, but wide variety, of today's bird species are captured on film for your viewing pleasure and for posterity. If passenger pigeons, which once numbered in the BILLIONS, were still alive today, I have no doubt that footage of their SPECTACULAR mass migration flights would be included in this film. Such footage would make the starling flight footage in the film look puny in comparison.</span>

                    <span>Fantastic landscapes, complete with the obligatory French swipe at America. The one and only scene in the film which depicts wild birds being shot out of the air by hunters takes place in, you guessed it... <P>According to the film's credits:<P>"The hunting scene was filmed in North America, on sites where it takes place every year."<P>As if the sport of bird hunting is somehow limited to North America, or was introduced to the world by North America.<P>And Duck L'Orange isn't a French dish?<P>At least for me, the swipe detracted greatly from this otherwise wonderful film.</span>

                    <span>The images of the birds flying were so lovely....I really liked this video, as I love birds, but I have to admit, in the middle of the DVD, I was a bit bored. Beautiful video, just not for someone who likes exciting films, but over all, very good. I would reccomend "Winged Migration" to everyone who likes bird watching or calm, peaceful movies.</span>
