                <span id="Label1"><i>Masters of the Links</i> is a simply stunning collection of essays; most are lyrically crafted and as varied and intriguing as an afternoon stroll on a tough 18. Golf-course architects are a remarkable breed: lovers of the land and lovers of the game, they sculpt art out of nature as a challenge to those who dare to play on  their masterpieces. In <i>Masters of the Links</i> some of the best designers ever to contour a fairway and tilt a green offer up some of the madness behind their methods. From pioneers such as Alister MacKenzie and Albert Warren Tillinghast to contemporary designers such as Pete Dye and Tom Doak, the collection explores how golf thinking has changed through the years--and how it's stayed the same. "A golf hole, humanly speaking, is like life," observed C. B. MacDonald, who carved the hallowed National Golf Links out of Eastern Long Island almost a century ago, "in as much as one cannot judge justly of any person's character the first time one meets him." Like a great golf hole, <i>Masters of the Links</i> has much to divulge on each meeting, and you don't need to be a golfer to savor the elegance and insight teed up in its prose.  </span>

                    <span>Where were all these essays hiding? What fun if you love courses and golf. The first book that makes golf architecture really understandable and fun. The old writings are especially funny and interesting, and the editor sets them up nicely and conscisely. Of the modern architects, Crenshaw's essay was the only disappointment because I wanted to read more of what he had to say. But he still makes a great case for the need for more short par-3's on modern golf courses. Also, great artwork, photos and production too.</span>

                    <span>A real nice addition to any golf library. A rich and varied collection of essays, with some interesting vintage B&W photos of famous courses in their earlier states before today's "advanced" agronony. Most of the book is from golf's "Golden Age" - and is fascinating reading, raising some thoughtful insights for today's players. A plus and minus: the essays are short, three and four pagers...so it's excellent bedtime reading, but may lack a little depth for true students of the game who may want more. If you enjoyed Spirit of St. Andrews, or one of Tom Doak's books, you'll like this, too. In all, a very entertaining, balanced anthology for we duffers who enjoy delving a little deeper into the history, heritage and color of the game.</span>

There is so much to be learned from these Masters. It all serves to help us get more out of the game we love and the courses we play.
