                    <span>This book is a delight to read. The author summarizes his interviews and research of noted inventors and concludes that there are eleven secrets to their inventions.  These become the chapters in his book:
<br />
<br />1) Creating Possibilities, 2) Pinpointing Problems, 3) Recognizing Patterns, 4) Channeling Chance, 5) Transcending Boundaries, 6) Detecting Barriers, 7) Applying Analogies, 8) Visualizing Results, 9) Embracing Failure, 10) Multiplying Insights, 11) Thinking Systematically.
<br />
<br />I found these chapters to be the most interesting: Visualizing Results, Applying Analogies and Thinking Systematically.
<br />
<br />The book is interesting to read because the author weaves research into invention with interesting interviews with active inventors.  Here's an example on visualization, talking with Stephen Jacobsen, Sarcos Research, who runs an invention firm specializing in robotics:
<br />
<br />"... he begins painting word pictures in rapid-fire succession that illustrate how his creations work. He is the kind of man who wouldn't seem outof place zipped up in a silver jumpsuit as the scientific captain on a spacestation orbiting the galaxy... Like many of his peers, Jacobsen collects inventions from the past. In his case, especially, these props serve as inspirations for thinking visually... Jacobsen is more interested in perceiving problems and quandaries firsthand - unburdened by the knowledge of prior approaches -- and then visualizing a new idea on his own."
<br />
<br />Thus, each chapter develops an important trait of inventors and then illustrates just how that trait is used to invent. He illustrates each chapter with two or three inventors.  There is little repeat in the choice of inventors.  I found all of the interview material most intriguing.  The book ends with a detailed bibliography. But much of the really interesting material came from his interviews with living inventors.
<br />
<br />This is a delightful, interesting, important and well-written book. Required for anyone interested in invention and technology.

                    <span>This is an instructive and inspiring book for creative types who are accustomed to harnessing their creativity, struggling to find the right single and systemic invention, and then moving on. It's a misunderstood breed in this world of instant gratification and self-aggrandizement -- to have someone invent something, and then not milk it for social status. Instead, here are stories of inventors who channel their ability to look ahead into many different directions, use their windfalls from patents and profits to explore new possibilities, and cope with the mix of invention -- achievement for themselves and their ideas, and dismissal from the establishment. This book puts the idea factories in people's heads in the proper perspective -- leading the parade. Well-researched, very current, and full of interesting threads woven together by good writing. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>As a filmmaker researching a documentary about innovators and inventors, I bought this book after hearing the author speak on NPR. Having recently spent time with a famous inventor I was intrigued to learn more about what made people like him "tick", which seemed to be the subject "Juice" was attempting to tackle. Imagine my joy when I saw the name of the man I met listed in the inside cover as one of the people Evan Schwartz chose to study in this incredibly informative, inspiring and easy to read book. 
<br />
<br />Choosing to explain through example, Schwartz brings to the forefront the incredible stories of some of the most fascinating thinkers (and doers) living today, most of them completely unknown to the general public. In case after case the building blocks of innovation come to life in compelling fashion and it is not long before the reader concludes, as guided by the author, that behind the seeming randomness of invention is a systematic process that can be studied and emulated. 
<br />
<br />Through meticulous (and probably very fun) research, Schwartz has discovered a through-line in the lives of great inventors froma variety of disciplines that serves to explain or at least illuminate a process that has heretofor been largely ignored. At the very least, if similar research already existed, it has not been made nearly as accesible or compelling. 
<br />
<br />The book is also amazingly up to date and does a great job of leading you toward some pretty profound realizations about our potential future and the kind of people who will help guide us into it. 
<br />
<br />There are few stones left unturned, including obvuoius icons of our history like Bell, Edison, Goodyear, Ford, Farnsworth (whom the author has written another book about that I look forward to reading) and others.
<br />
<br />Lastly, as someone who has always feared that the sparks of innovation firing within me are doomed to be stifled by the conventions of everyday life, this book (more than others I've read) allowed me to identify profoundly with many of the peculiar processes and tendancies identified by the author. This was an unexpected bonus that accompanied an otherwise fulfilling education and opened a door I look forward to diving through hence forth. Given that one of his key arguments is that many people can nurture the part of our brains that lead to innovative thinking and invention once they understand how and why it works, I imagine many other readers will be equally stimulated.  </span>

                    <span>Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors is a remarkable history that explores the minds of some of the most prolific and innovative inventors in history and living in the modern day. Delving into the stories behind classic inventions as well as the people behind current innovations, whether in science, mechanics, or business systems, Juice strives to understand the fundamental keys to creation - such as learning to channel chance, embrace failure, think systematically, and more.

                    <span>At a time when more and more of the mundane tasks are moving off shore, the United States will depend more and more on new developments, new inventions, new concepts in the way of doing business, and most important, new companies to provide the fuel for new employment in the future. The United States has a culture that accepts and rewards invention better than anywhere else in the world, and this is combined with a huge market capable of accepting the volumes of product that are needed to establish a viable business and the capital markets that can fund it.  
<br />
<br />The author of this book is a contributing writer to MIT's Technology Review. He used this background to have discussions with a few dozen inventors and to consolidate their thoughts into this book. The book is a bit different from other books in the invention catagory in that it also discusses such things as why the particular invention is good, and why it makes business sense. Some of the discussions in the book deal with things like the law suits that come from trying to enforce the patent rights of inventions.  
<br />
<br />At a time when the companies are getting bigger, they are also getting less able to invent. This is an interesting book on JUICE, the creative fuel that drives the inventor.</span>
