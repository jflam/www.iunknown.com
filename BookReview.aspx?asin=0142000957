                <span id="Label1">A tour de force of investigative journalism-this is the story of the violent rise and fall of Pablo Escobar, the head of the Colombian Medellin cocaine cartel. Escobar's criminal empire held a nation of thirty million hostage in a reign of terror that would only end with his death. In an intense, up-close account, award-winning journalist Mark Bowden exposes details never before revealed about the U.S.-led covert sixteen-month manhunt. With unprecedented access to important players-including Colombian president C&eacutesar Gaviria and the incorruptible head of the special police unit that pursued Escobar, Colonel Hugo Martinez-as well as top-secret documents and transcripts of Escobar's intercepted phone conversations, Bowden has produced a gripping narrative that is a stark portrayal of rough justice in the real world. <br><br>  "The story of how the U.S. Army Intelligence and Delta Force commandos helped Colombian police track down and kill Pablo Escobar is a compelling, almost Shakespearean tale." (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>) <br><br> "Absolutely riveting. . . . Mark Bowden has a way of making modern nonfiction read like the best of novels." (<i>The Denver Post</i>)</span>

                    <span>I read the book Killing Pablo by Mark Bowden and I would definitely have to say that this would be my book of choice if I had to choose one from the past year. The book describes in detail the events that happened in Pablo Escobar's life and how he went from the slums of Colombia to the most powerful drug lord in the world.The different literary techniques that were presented throughout the book enhanced the story line and the added details made it very interesting. Each chapter or section of the book was told by a different point of view. I think that this technique made it much easier to actually see how many different people Pablo and his illegal business effected. For example, some of the chapters were told by the various law enforcement groups and explained what exactly they were doing to bring Pablo Escobar down. At the same time, another chapter was told in the Pablo's mother's point of view, which made the reader realize what kind of background Pablo came from and all about the people who actually did care about Pablo as a person rather than for his power or drugs. Much of the slang and vocabulary tended to make the story go by slower just because of the difficulty to read. Because of this factor, I would have to recommend this book to a more advanced or older audience, so that they can fully understand the book. Overall I would definitely recommend this book because of the unique way it is written and the interesting but true story it presents.</span>

                    <span>This is a fascinating tale of the life and death of a modern day outlaw, Pablo Escobar, a Colombian narcotics trafficker who became more powerful than the government of the country in which he lived. <P>		The book raises an interesting moral point. To defeat Pablo it was necessary to kill him. He was too powerful in Colombia to be suppressed by legal means. What should a government do when it is faced with a merciless gang? Is it ever moral for a government to sanction the murder of its citizens? Is the struggle against a powerful criminal gang akin to a war in which killing political opponents is "fair play?" Is an employee or family member of an evil man a fair target? The author reports the facts as he discovered them and doesn't express a clear opinion, but his story of Pablo's killing makes you ponder right and wrong. <P>	The author constructed "Killing Pablo" by interviewing participants. The story is necessarily one-sided as so many of its characters ended up dead. The actions of the Colombian and U.S. governments in ridding the world of Pablo Escobar will be applauded by some and deplored by others. Read the book and make up your own mind. It's a thought-provoking story of evil.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book because I really liked Black Hak Down. This book is written in the same style that made BHD a great book. There is great attention to detail, personal portraits of the characters, and an ever-evolving storyline. My exposure to Pablo Escobar before this book was just a brief understanding that he was a drug dealer from way back. Other than that I could not tell you much about the guy. But after reading this book, I have a much better understanding of the man and why the U.S. wanted him neutralized. <P>Great read. Quick read. Must buy.</span>

                    <span>This book, inadvertently, I suspect, is really an argument against the drug war. By now a cliche, this line of thought postulates that, were drugs like cocaine not criminalized in the states, there would be no or little incentive for murderous thugs in Latin America to risk murder and lengthy prison times getting the drug in this country.<P>Thus, one could argue, quite blithely, that, had the American government wised up and attempted to regulate drug trafficking like any other international business, many of the unsavory elements of the business would depart for greener (more illicit) pastures. The natural consequence of this, of course, would be that millions of dollars otherwise spent on futile attempts at interdiction and eradication would be spent elsewhere, and many of the thousands of people killed both in the United States and Latin America over the past 25 years would instead be alive. <P>Would that it were true that the United States could hew to the lessons learned in the alcohol trade: once alcohol was legal again in the United States and it became a regulated drug sold only to people legally eligible to buy it, the violence associated with it declined precipitously. In fact, the only violence associated with alcohol use today is domestic violence and drunk driving. Those violent acts, while of course tragic to all those involved in them, are far fewer and far less bloody than the gang wars initiated by Al Capone and his antogonists.<P>That the same lesson applies in the drug war is sad.<P>On another note, a number of reviewers on this site have mentioned many apparent parallels between the hunt for Pablo Escobar and the hunt for Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. While it is true that, superficially, there are parallels, such as the US government deciding that its national security in all three instances was at risk with these monsters operating openly, it is nonetheless an unfair comparison. Relatively few Colombians liked Escobar, and he never had the legitimacy of the state behind him, as did Hussein.<P>Given all that, this is an excellent account of the travails leading up to, and concluding with, the execution of Escobar.</span>
