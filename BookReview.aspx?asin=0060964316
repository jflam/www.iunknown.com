                    <span>I have never read Foner's longer treatment of this tragic period in  American history, "Reconstruction, America's Unfinished  Revolution," but this abridgement gives an exellent overview of the  subject. Foner debunks the theory that the "Radical Republicans"  were the bad guys and the Andrew Johnson was a moderate acting in the  spirit of Lincoln. In fact, there was very little progress in restoring  rights to freedmen during the first year or two after the Civil War under  Johnson's "moderate" approach. In fact, Johnson, while a firm  supporter of the Union during the war was, in his views towards blacks, a  racist as demonstrated by statemnets Johnson made and which this book  documents. It was only after the "Radicals" forced federal  intervention that blacks made significant progress. Unfortunately,  Democrats began to make headway in the South, often by the use of  intimidation and violence, and what remained of the Republican party began  to change it's agenda. Certainly, the Republicans in the North became  indifferent, culminating in President Rutherford B. Hayes' abandonment of  Reconstruction after his narrow victory over Samuel Tilden in the 1876  election. This book is illumi\nating and well written. Although an  abridgement, it reads smoothly rather than as a patchwork. I recommend this  book to all who are interested in this underemphasized period of American  history</span>

                    <span>Readers looking for the roots of difficulties that still plague the U.S. will find the perfect precis in A SHORT HISTORY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION. Civil rights freed of racial or gender limitations, race relations, states' rights versus federal laws, the rise of financial and business trusts, the foundations for all these "modern" issues are succinctly excavated and eloquently put on display by Foner in this great book. Should be required reading. Bravo!</span>

                    <span>Eric Foner's Short History is good reading.  In chronologically encapsulates a unique era in history.  Unfortunately, because Mr. Foner does not give very many details about the good or bad done by black legislators, it is hard to make an accurate judgment about whether black representation was a travesty or a splendid awakening.   Perhaps one needs to read the uncondensed version for that.   It's a great overview, however, that I would have spiced up with selected detail.  (Alan J.
