                <span id="Label1">Aimed at the intermediate VB developer, <I>Visual Basic Developer's Guide to E-&nbsp;Commerce with ASP and SQL Server</I> is an appealing and approachable tour of the basics of building e-commerce Web sites powered by ASPs. Focused on real results, this book is all you need to start mastering e-commerce using some of today's most popular Microsoft tools.<p> The guide shows how to build an online CD store (with some clothing, like T-shirts, thrown in for good measure)  by combining ASPs using VBScript and ADO for calling SQL Server stored database procedures on the back end. Instead of learning about every whistle and bell, you find out what works specifically for a small online store. Early chapters let you design the database and get up and running with a workable browser interface, including a shopping basket, order history, and tax and shipping computations. Later chapters add administrative and management functions for changing what products are available (among other options). In its final version, the Web site gets support for cross-promotions and putting products on sale.<p> Although the solution doesn't take advantage of MTS/COM+ on the middle tier, you can expect good results with this approach because of stored procedures. The book also does a good job of planning for scalability with sections on Web server architecture and performance tuning. For more advanced development, there's also a thorough tour of more advanced options for e-&nbsp;commerce on the Microsoft platform centering on Site Server, Commerce Edition (with its customizable pipeline model). The text closes with a consideration of the sample stores available within this package.<p> E-commerce on the Windows server platform can certainly be daunting. <I>Visual Basic Developer's Guide to E-Commerce with ASP and SQL Server</I> is easy to understand, and it delivers an approachable tutorial on practical and successful development using some of the most important Microsoft tools. It will definitely help you build sites that work for real-world online commerce. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Tutorial for building an e-&nbsp;commerce site, ASP and VBScript basics, Microsoft Site Server, Commerce Edition, and tools, SQL Server basics and stored procedures, Visual Basic 6, security and certificates, database tables for e-commerce, server farms and scalability, load balancing, the store foundation and basic user interface, shopping basket, checkout, taxes and shipping, administrative screens, promotions, cross-selling and up-selling, managing sales, the order processing pipeline, overview of Site Server sample stores, best practices and scalability.</span>

                    <span>I think Noel did a good job writing this book. The code is well laid out. Code is reusable, and above all it doesnt tie you lot into registering DLLs. The only minus is for not having the full code on the CD which is mentioned in the book. 
<br />  Over all its a good reference for beginners to mid level programmers.</span>

                    <span>This book bring me from Intermediate level into advanced level.<br>It shows you all real useful examples by utilizing ASP, VB, Db design, and Stored Procedures calls. It's kind of learning how real-world sophisticated shoppong sites(like amazon.com) are created.  I am very happy with the book.  If you want to become a professional web developer, or learn how to design a data-driven web site, the book is what you want.<p>I recommend that the book is for Intermediate level who has some experiences in VB, SQL Server.</span>

                    <span>Although title says developer's guide but it makes a reader from novice to developer. Before that e-commerce was complicated,difficult even reading other books makes you confuse more about the subject but after reading this whole concept  becomes clear. In my opinion Only prerequisite for reading this book is some databases experiance, it will accelarate if reader have experiance in Access, Sql server.  The 99 percent Use of stored procedure is one of the greatest thing by Noel. I have built my web site base on concept and examples given in this book. Though there might be some minor errors but I think they make you learn and eventualy they make you master the vb script, stored procedure and concept.<br>I congrulate Noel and request him to upgrade this book to Asp.net and vb.net as well as other of his book named e-commerce developer's guide to building community tools.<p>Thanks Noel</span>

                    <span>I agree with many reviewers of this book that there are simply too many errors. The book is divided into two parts. The first part is devoted to the development of a website. The second part is devoted to the management of a website. It is in the second part of this book that one would find a majority of the errors. <p>Most of the errors I found are simple typos, such as on page 413 the author forgot to close an input tag. There are some many of these types of errors that I grew accustomed to finding them whenever I tested the codes. <p>Some errors I found are logical errors. They consumed a lot of my time whenever I tried to fix them. Take for example; on page 466 the author did not include codes to clear several option variables. Thus, each time a new loop was performed, the option variables still contained old values from the previous loop. This produced very unexpected results. Once I added my own codes to clear the option variables before a new loop, the problem was solved. <p>It became clear to me that the author had not tested the codes because if he had, he would have discovered the same errors.<p>Use this book as a learning tool. But proceed with caution as it is plagued with many errors.</span>
