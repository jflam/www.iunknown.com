                    <span>I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I'm no expert on TR, Wilson, Taft, or Debs, but I think this book serves as a well-written and entertaining introduction to the people and issues surrounding an important election.  I teach an American government course and this book was an excellent vehicle for class discussion.  From the book we were able to talk about elections, political parties, the role of government in addressing societal problems, and a host of other topics.  It's a good thing that Debs was featured in the book.  Socialism thankfully never stood a chance in this country, but people need to appreciate why so many people were giving it a serious look at the time.  Debs, although misguided, was a hardworking man offering something unique.  People today do not appreciate the difficulties and day-to-day suffering so many citizens had to deal with.  So it is.
<br />
<br />The book largely focuses on TR and Wilson, who were the powerhouses of the first two decades of 20th century American politics; it seemed to most of my students and myself that TR was presented in a better light.  Maybe that is the way it was.  Don't know.  </span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book.  It reads easily, is well organized, and gives a good feel of the times.  I would highly recommend this book.  If you like history but don't care to grind through vast lists of names that are hard to absorb or track, this is for you.  It stays in focus.
<br />
<br />Worth adding to your library.

                    <span>Chace does a good job of detailing why the election of 1912 was so important to the United States.  He describes the four participants in the election of 1912: Wilson, Taft, Roosevelt, and Debs.  Bryan was also a factor in the Democratic nomination of Wilson.  The main focus of this book is how these leaders would affect change in America.  Taft was the conservative and Debs was the radical.  Roosevelt and Wilson were the candidates for the Progressive faction of the country.  Chace describes each candidate and all his positives and negatives.  I didn't know Wilson was such a reactionary on race and immigrant relations, while Roosevelt was generally very liberal on these issues.  All in all a good book about the campaign and why the Republican Party veered to the right.
<br />For those interested in the politics of America, this is a good read.  The reader would be surprised to find that the red and blue states have actually changed over the years.  In the past, the South was reactionary and the West was Progressive while the East and Midwest favored the conservative (Republican) issues. Not so today.  Hats off to Chace for writing a good read.</span>

                    <span>In 1912 four of the giants of American politics faced each other in one of the most interesting presidential elections in the history of the United States. James Chace has chosen this election as the topic of his latest book and he weaves his story in a most pleasing way. Anyone who enjoys a good story will enjoy this book and it doesn't matter if the reader knows anything about this election and the players involved or not for the author has laid out all of the main details in a very clear way.  Unfortunately, due to complexity of the story and the limited length of this study there is very little depth or new information to be found here.
<br />
<br />Chace does an excellent job of introducing his readers to the players and to the basics of the story, but that is about as far as it goes. A volume twice this length could easily be produced that studies only the campaign for the Democratic or Republican nomination so these events as well as many others do not get the attention that they deserve. Even more distressing is that Chace never even gets close to making a sound argument that this election was "The Election that Changed America." His argument seems to be that had the Republicans nominated Roosevelt they would today be the party of progressivism instead of conservatism. Chace completely ignores the fact that the real shift had occurred sixteen years before this when the Democrats had stepped to the left by nominating William Jennings Bryan in 1896. The author makes no allusion to the fact that since 1896 many conservative eastern Democrats had migrated to the GOP and their presence had driven the Republicans even further right making Roosevelt's nomination in 1912 almost impossible. 
<br />
<br />The author does argue that Roosevelt and Wilson fundamentally changed the Presidency, pushing the office along the road to today's imperial Presidency. On this point Chace seems to be correct but Roosevelt had already been in office and only Wilson's part in this theory is dependent on this election. The rest of Chace's theory is just not presented in a very convincing way. 
<br />
<br />If convincing people that the election of 1912 did indeed change America is the author's goal he has failed and he would have been far better off if he had left the subtitle out. On the other hand he has told the story of this election in a very nice way. This book is a good place for anyone interested in the politics of America in the early twentieth century to begin their exploration of the subject. There are also some very interesting chapters dealing with Eugene Debs and his Socialists but most of the material on the other candidates has been done to death. In short, I enjoyed this book but found very little new information or critical analysis. It is well written but not the definitive work on the subject by any means.</span>

                    <span>  James Chace is a professor who is adept at writing a book in clear, succint and understandable prose. In this new tome he
<br />examines the exciting 1912 Presidental race. The candidates:
<br />1. William Howard Taft the heir apparent to the Republican
<br />Presidential crown worn with aplomb by the genius T.R. Taft
<br />was conservative and pro-big business. He loved TR and was
<br />hurt when the Rough Rider left the Republican Party to initiate his own Progressive (Bull Moose Party). Taft loved the law and later was appointed to the US Supreme Court. He was kind, affable, henpecked and was a mediocre president and poor campaigner. He came in third in the general election.
<br />2. Woodrow Wilson-The son of the Presbyterian manse, former
<br />President of Princteton and an idealistic reformer he won the
<br />race and went on to serve two terms. Wilson was a racist and
<br />was not popular among the immigrant voters. He comes across as
<br />shallow in thought and stubborn in his refusal to work with Republicans in getting the League of Nations entry for the US
<br />approved following World War I. The prissy Wilson did manage to 
<br />work for reforms in business and government. He was the arch foe of T.R. His mantra was a New Freedom for America,
<br />3. Theodore Roosevlet-one of our greatest presidents he decided to run for a third term after becoming disgusted with the rightward drift of the GOP. He preached a gospel of regulating the trusts, fiscal reform and a new nationalism. TR believed in a  strong military and civil rights. His feud with Taft led to a splintering of the Republican party opening the door for Democrat Wilson to walk into the White House. TR died in 1919
<br />embittered by the loss of his son Quentin in World War One . If 
<br />he had lived he would probably had been touted to head the GOP
<br />ticket in 1920.
<br />4. Eugene Debs-a giant of American labor agitation he fought hard for the rights of the poor and union members. Debs was
<br />a controversial figure who was jailed in World War I for sedition only to be pardoned by Warren G. Harding in 1921.
<br />Debs was a complex figure but an appealing one.
<br />  In today's political arena one wishes presidential timber grew as tall as it did in 1912.
<br />   Chace's tall is a general account of the election. It is a
<br />good book and an indispensible one for someone who knows nothing about the 1912 presidential contes. As such it will appeal more to the general reader than the seasoned scholar of the era.
<br />   I read the book in two days enjoying it and learning from it.
