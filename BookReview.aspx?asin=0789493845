                    <span>Oh, this book made me wish I was in France. Pictures of Lavender fields, sweeping views of the Plateau de Valensole (the largest lavender-growing areas of Provence), the Vieux Port looking south, with Notre-Dame de-la-Garde that I didn't have time to see because we were too busy shopping for pretty French clothes and soaps. <P>You will be delighted with information on The Riviera, The Alpes Maritimes, The Var, The Iles D'Hyères, Bouches-Du-Rhône, Nîmes, Vaucluse and Alpes-De-Haute-Provence. <P>This book is part of a series of books called: Eyewitness Travel Guides. Each book is a graphically exciting and visually pleasing guidebook. You will find concise maps, carefully selected hotels, restaurants and cafes in all price ranges, 800-full color photographs, unique cutaways and floor plans to help you explore public buildings and landmarks and town-by-town information on sights, beaches, cafe life, markets, and festivals. <P>I started reading: "Cassis is a lovely little port, tucked into limestone hills.....Cassis is still known for its excellent seafood." pg. 153 (Is that why I ordered two helpings? :) We sat in the sun at an outdoor restaurant and had the most amazing fish I have ever had in my life. <P>They brought the fish out to us and then we selected what looked like freshly caught fish. I am sure it was because it was quite delicious. We wandered around and found a bakery (la boulangerie) and a place to buy olive oil and garlic. Of all the places I went, Cassis stands out as a place I would want to stay a bit longer. We found it quite by accident and even though you might take this book along, I think sometimes the places you find just by accident are going to be the most memorable. <P>If you want to visit Provence or if you have been there, this book will serve as an excellent way to wet your appetite or as a journey of delightful remembrance. <P>If you don't hear from me again, I went to live in an idyllic spot in Provence. Sigh....<P>P.S. 1. The French Phrase Book ISBN: 0-7894-3234-X is a great little book of essential words and phrases. <P>P.S. 2. Provence: A Country Almanac by Louisa Jones is not to be missed as a coffe table collectable book. <P>P.S. 3. To learn how to make those French desserts: Chocolate by Patricia Lolusada<P>P.S. 4. The French Dictionary ISBN: 0-7894-4494-1 has over 50,000 words and phrases.<P>P.S. 5. If you want to see a cute movie: Go look up the reviews for: A Year in Provence. What I loved was that Peter was a writer and he is always trying to finish his novel. His wife helps him on a writing assignment about Provence and that is when things turn more into a mystery. If you know of any movies or books on Provence, feel free to e-mail the information to me. I would be delighted!</span>

                    <span>We just spent five days in Cannes, France. This book was great as a pre-trip planning guide to do preliminary research the area and the sites to see. The wonderful pictures got us very excited for the trip.<P>However, once there, we found the guide book didn't have enough practical information, such as how to get to the sites. (It was shear luck we found the Matisse Museum in Nice) It gave a great overview of the entire area of Provence and the Cote D'azur, but didn't go into depth enough on any one place to be your only guide book.<P>I was very impressed with one of the resteraunts they recommended. It was one of the "least expensive" restaurant and was one of the best meals we have ever had. While the quanity of recommended resteraunts was not there, I would continue to get the DK travel books if the quality is as good.</span>

                    <span>What a great guide; this book is a gold mine of off-the-beaten path places. I ran into very few American tourists and discovered many secret places that I'll definitely visit again. The photographs and detailed descriptions of using pay telephones, parking meters and public bathrooms were great and saved me alot of time on the learning curve. I like that it doesn't contain huge laundry lists of hotel and restaurant addresses; I enjoy patronizing establishments that I find by just walking around. There is something for every style of traveller in this little gem!</span>
