                    <span>At first blush most of the information if acted on in the book will probably result in adding years, if not decades to some peoples lives.  My own recommendation is to do your own independent research [separate from this book], first, if you make any life changing adjustments, particularly if it involves consuming vitamins suggested in the book.  Some of the recommendations only strengthened what I already knew, such as taking Co-Q10 on a daily basis.  Co-Q10 is expensive, but a very good nutrient that can help protect your body from free radical damage, resulting in reduced risks of succumbing to various cancers and heart diseases.  Other recommendations in the book did raise some concerns for me such as consuming L-Carnosine on a daily basis.  Research i've found dating back to 1984 expressed that L-Carnosine built up in the body can potentially have dangerous neurotoxic side effects.  Taking too much of it could induce what is medically referred to as "Carnosinemia", which also can be inherited.  Most of the oral vitamin supplements in the market offer L-Carnosine at 500MG doses, recommending you take it once or twice daily.  The book recommends 200MG per day in single or "divided doses" and stressed "its low level of toxicity"...... but I don't know how much is too much frankly, so I will avoid this particular molecule until more research data is known.  </span>

                    <span>Over the years I have read several health oriented books promoting ideas for healthier and longer lives for us, this one is by far the best, containing down-to-earth advice of a practical and far reaching nature. Many areas are covered, including supplements from arginine to zinc, social issues, and lots of other topics. <p>This book supports the method of using biostasis (cryonics) at the time of death as a means of reaching the future era of advanced nanomedicine, much anticipated by many scientists who work in this nascent field. About fifteen pages are devoted to cryonics, a very good introduction to this subject, an idea and practice that is slowly becoming 'mainstream'. In fact, Terry Grossman, himself an M.D., is signed up for cryonics.<p>Overall, this volume contains much useful advice and should be read by everyone.</span>

                    <span>With a title like, "The Baby Boomers' Guide To Living Forever," it would be easy to pass over this book with the assumption that it is a journey into some sort of medical never-never land. But as I quickly discovered, this is far from the case. "The Baby Boomers' Guide" shapes as an absolutely fascinating, at times scholarly, tour of what middle age America can do to improve both the quality and quantity of life. Dr. Grossman covers a remarkable spectrum of topics and, with support from co-authors who are experts in each of dozens of medical/health areas, provides an astonishing treasure of useful information. This is one of those rare books that can literally change the course of the reader's life. "Baby Boomers' Guide" is must reading for anyone who is serious about extending their years, perhaps beyond anything that they ever imagined was possible.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Grossman and the co-authors have put together one of the best longevity / anti-aging books around.  They don't just banter on about generalities as other authors do on the subject, but provide practical and  real information.  This book is a good guide for one interested in the  anti-aging movement, not only the patient but for doctors discovering this  field of medicine.</span>
