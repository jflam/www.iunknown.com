                    <span>Like always, the Muench's photos are excellent but from the viewpoint of a book; especially, a how-to book, this book has not met its mark.<br>Lots of rumblings but does not delve into techniques and how-to's.<br>Conclusions: good coffee table book but it will not be in landscape photography reference shelves.</span>

                    <span>Unlike most books of natural photography, this one is filled with outstanding essays that explore the ancient beliefs, philosophical observations, and scientific knowledge that have evolved about the fundamental forces of earth, air, fire, and water.  The landscapes are often reproduced with colored filters to give them an alien appearance, that makes the images seem stranger and more powerful.  Double exposures help reinforce the theme of the compounding effects of these primal forces on one another.  This book, as a result, becomes an interesting example of how photography can be used to extend our understanding of a subject rather than just show us examples or beauty.  Very high quality paper and reproduction enhance the message's effectiveness.    <p>The book is in four primary sections, one each on "earth," "air," "fire," and "water."  The essay on "earth" deals with plate tectonics.  "Air" talks about atmospheric circulation, storms and how wind affects the land (especially through sandstorms).  "Fire" talks about volcanoes, forest fires, and the effect of fires on plant life.  "Water" explains about floods, ocean currents, tides, waves, and rivers.  The images in each section capture many of the elements in the essays.<p>In a final brief essay on "The Living Earth" the Gaea Hypothesis is introduced, which is the idea that these forces interact in a way that balances out to keep life viable on the planet.  <p>My favorite images in the book included:<p>Mount Assiniboine, British Columbia, Canada<p>Neon Canyon, Utah, USA<p>Navajo Sandstone, Arizona, USA<p>Redwood, California, USA<p>Mono Lake, California, USA<p>White Sands, New Mexico, USA<p>Haystack Rock, Oregon, USA<p>Littoral Cone, Hawaii, USA<p>Red Rock Crossing, Arizona, USA<p>Waimea Bay, Hawaii, USA<p>Milford Sound, New Zealand<p>Neskowin Coastline, Oregon, USA<p>I also suggest that you try to find ways to visit these scenes.  As wonderful as photographs are, the actual experiences can often be more emotional and fulfilling.  Armed with your knowledge of the sites from the essays, you should be better able to appreciate the impact that these forces are having when you are next to them.<p>Feel and act in accordance to the connections within nature!</span>

                    <span>Another gorgeous production by the Muench father & son combination.  The maturity of Marc`s work continues to improve with every new book they  produce together. The accompanying essay by Michelle A.Gilders is also  extremely fascinating,and compliments the photographs perfectly.  Perhaps  my only gripe is the number of double exposures and magenta filtered  pictures in this book. Artistic maybe,but not as true a representation of  the World as David`s earlier work.  Still,with such high quality paper,and  very good production work, I certainly can highly recommend it. Thankyou  again,David and Marc,for insight into a world that few of us ever truly  have the chance(or the vision) to see.</span>
