                <span id="Label1">Macromedia's Dreamweaver MX 2004 is the leading software tool for the creation of Web sites and other HTML interfaces. It's remarkably capable, able to deal intelligently with everything from fonts and images to JavaScript for client-side data validation and embedded Java applets. In most cases, Dreamweaver will save you time over hand-coding--and yield better-looking pages to boot. The program's learning curve, though, isn't trivial. That's why <I>Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual</I> is worth having on hand as you learn to use Dreamweaver, and worth keeping within reach as you tackle increasingly difficult Web development work. <p>  David McFarland wrote this book, but the influence of esteemed series editor David Pogue is obvious in the careful coverage of features and frequent touches of humor (books about applications can be whangingly dull; the books in Pogue's <I>Missing Manual</I> series consistently manage to avoid this problem while maintaining comprehensiveness). The two men treat Dreamweaver's numerous features (and the even more numerous ways of putting them to use) cleverly, with a combination of procedures and side information that clarifies many oddball situations as well as straightforward conditions. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to create HTML (XHTML and CSS, strictly speaking) documents using Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004. In addition to the basic stuff (text, images, links, and frames), the book shows you how to build forms for data submission and embed Flash movies and Java applets. There's also a lot of helpful emphasis on Dreamweaver's productivity features, like snippet libraries and file transfer utilities. A special section shows you how to do some server-side work with databases.</span>

                    <span>I'm learning Dreamweaver MX 2004, and I find this book really helpful. It has a lot of information and tutorials. It's a great book to learn the basics from, and then use as a reference guide, to look things up when you need to. Now I'm an unofficial back-up editor for this site:

                    <span>Trying to figure out how to work my Captain Video decoder ring is as close to programming as I'd ever gotten. (Dates me, I know.) So I figured I was relegated to "The Cosmically Clueless Fool's Guide to Dreamweaver MX". Until I found out about this "Missing Manual" series. Since most software manuals seem to be written by idiot savants for whom English is only marginally considered to be a functional language, I was amazed when I started with this thing. It is totally engaging, terrifically well written, very easy to follow, as logical as Spock, and comprehensive without descending into the anesthetizing world of Geekdom. In a word, it is... fun! It seems that every nuance of DWMX is touched on with patience, a total concern for reader understanding, and quite frequently with humor. The tutorials are excellent - everything laid out carefully and clearly step-by-step. I cannot imagine a manual of such breadth being more user-friendly for the rank amateur as well as for the, well.... rank professional. A total delight!  My advice to anyone contemplating Dreamweaver or this manual - don't be intimidated. This is a manual written and designed the way manuals should be. Kudos to Mr. McFarland and Pogue!</span>

                    <span>I am almost done with David McFarland's book. I have read through it sequentially (and done each tutorial). It is easily one of the best software "how-to" manuals I've read. I've tried a few Dreamweaver sources (Lowery's Bible is also very good) and I do agree with another reviewer that Lynda.com has a great book and online movie tutorial, also. McFarland provides, for me, the ideal mix of discussion/reference and tutorial. For example, "forms" and "templates" are really boring if you just try to read about them - but his brief tutorials really work to get you through the basics. He gives broad coverage of Dreamweaver MX 2004; unlike some other books in this category that are really about Studio, this is limited to Dreamweaver with about one chapter on Flash integration. 
<br />
<br />The book is static HTML (more or less) until the last 150 pages or so, when he introduces dynamic databased connections - an area that I would NEVER understand with the Macromedia online help alone. I just finished the first couple of tutorials on dynamic database, and I am really impressed - I got through with no problems and a really good understanding. They have given the steps a real attention to detail here, little things, like noting a minor dialog glitch that might throw users off. Another great little innovation. At the end of each step, he explains what he's going to do next - a little thing that makes a big difference. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Possibly the best introductory tutorial I've ever read, and one that now serves as an invaluable reference for some of the tougher areas.  It takes you step-by-step but doesn't insult your intelligence.  Dreamweaver is *deep* and I was aghast at the idea of reading an 800-page book to learn how to work what I originally asssumed was a glorified text editor (silly me), but the book really opened my eyes.  Dreamweaver MX 2004 is a breathtaking product and you need this book to make it go.</span>

                    <span>This is the second book I buy from the "Missing Manual" series (the  first one being "Mac OSX: The Missing Manual"), and I keep buying them for a good reason: They're written in such a way that they make even hard or boring concepts easy to understand.
<br />Armed with this book you will be able to start building web pages and entire sites with pictures, links, interactive forms, CSS, JavaScript Behaviors  and, most important, clean HTML and XHTML.
<br />The only thing to keep in mind is that in order to work through the tutorials you need an Internet connection. However, once you're online  downloading the files is REALLY easy and the files are so small that you can store in floppy disks! (if you want to).
<br />If you want to enjoy learning Dreamweaver MX'04, get this book.</span>
