                <span id="Label1">This extraordinary book--the accompanying volume to the PBS series--looks at the history of slavery in the United States with an honesty that reveals both horror and heroism in the common humanity of all Americans. Uncovering the indigenous history of African slavery and the involvement of Arab and European nations, it then traces the journey of enslaved Africans across the "Middle Passage" of the Atlantic to the Caribbean and America. Charles Johnson's spellbinding fictional narratives beautifully evoke the feeling of times and places, such as the Haitian revolution or the plantation slave society. In "The Transmission," two captives in the bottom of a slave ship try to preserve their heritage. "Oboto quietly sang to his brother--in a language their captors could not understand--how their people long ago had navigated the New World ... on and on like a tapestry, Oboto unfurled their past, rituals, and laws in songs and riddles..."<p>  Poet/journalist Patricia Smith's historical anecdotes and references to legendary African American heroes (including Olaudah Equiano, Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglass), juxtaposed with rare documents, letters, slave advertisements, slave-ship cargo diagrams, and paintings, provide evidence of the African American fight for freedom, from the black soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War to the Underground Railroad to the return to combat in the Civil War. When emancipation finally came, Smith writes, "the newly liberated slaves sang for themselves, for their new country, and for the thousands upon thousands of Africans ripped from the clutches of home." <I>--Eugene Holley Jr.</I> </span>

                    <span> Wow, this book was informative and yet extremely hard to put down, this is combination i very seldomly come across. There is so much to say about this book. Although it's not exaustive by any means, it pretty much gives you that complete sequential view that you find yourself saying "oohhhh" to. What struck me most about this book was the denial and the need for white christian men to feel less guilty about their exploitation and how, many of the "moral men" including a few of our founding fathers, found themselves often contradicting themselves on the issue of slavery. On the one side they would say and admit that slavery was wrong but then justify their actions by claiming that they (the slaves) were better off that way, being that according to the whites, slaves were incapable of taking care of themselves. 
<br />   I enjoyed this book so much that i went ahead and bought the dvd as well to get a visisual of what i read. 
<br />
<br />bottom line, 
<br />if you want a straight foward book on slavery in america, look no further.</span>

                    <span>I happen to have not only learned from this book but also enjoyed reading it.  There's a lot of detail and even some inconsistencies but I've yet to come across a completely perfect representation of history.  As far as inconsistencies noted by a fellow reviewer, there is no one official count of slaves...there are only estimates, and those estimates are also broken down into several sub-categories.  You will find a variety of statistics on the slave trade but that should be expected by now...especially given the cruelty and inhuman conditions that existed.  Who's to say how many slaves were killed that were never reported?  
<br />
<br />Point blank...this book is worth the money.  It's a nice mix of fact that ties in your emotions with mini-storylines based on real occurrences.  </span>

                    <span>What struck me most about this book is the story of slaves during the Revoluntary War.  I'm a RW buff and hardly ever, and never in school's histroy books was this subject touched upon and to me it really had an  astounding effect on the war.  I didn't know that people in the 13 states  feared for their lives when the British offered freedom to the slaves if  they joined up with them.  And then after the long war, slave owners came  up from the south looking for them and dragging them out of bed.  The story  was to the point with a lot of interesting personal stories.  I think this  book should be put in all schools and this side of history should not be  avoided.  I suspected Jefferson was a jerk long ago and this confirms it  even more.  All these leaders of our country spouting words of liberty and  owning hundreds of slaves.  How could they have thought it was part of  God's plan and design?  .</span>

                    <span>"Africans in America" is a great book that vitalizes the Black American's history, and paints a perspective on slavery as an economic horror, not a moral evil. I HIGHLY recommend to all.</span>
