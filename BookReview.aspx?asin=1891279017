                    <span>The book is very easy to read and covers how to manage your attitude to get where you want to go. Readers of this book may appreciate "First Things First" or "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" by Dr. Steven R Covey. Covey examines how to determine what is important to you in your life. Covey and Keller's books work well together, but I have found that Covey's message is more important to understand first. Covey explains that if you don't have the right map of where you want to go in life, positive mental attitude will not be beneficial. It will in fact only delude you into thinking that everything is alright.</span>

                    <span>The content of this book seems to be a story of my life. I also went through a time where I was very down and negative. One day I decided to change my life by changing my thinking. I read books on attitude and listened to motivational tapes until I did indeed, change my thoughts and change my life. I also made a commitment years ago to dedicate my life to helping others realize that we create our own destinies. Jeff did a great job laying out the "lessons" it took me SO many years to learn, in one easy to read, motivational masterpiece that teaches "real" happiness. I HIGHLY recommend Attitude Is Everything!</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best books I read in a long, long time. What makes this book so special is that it's written in such a personable style. The author writes as if he is really talking just to you! His enthusiasm to help you improve you attitude is outstanding. His examples are from typical people who changed their attitude and thereby changed their life! <P>Another great thing about this book is that it short and to the point. There is no time for fluff in the Jeff's phenomenal book. Jeff's a no nonsense person. His approach to self improvement makes this book really stand out from being just another self help book. I found this book to be really motivating! I feel that my attitude greatly improved by reading this book! Highly recommended!<P>Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works and founder of EmpoweringMessages.com</span>

                    <span>I appreciate this book's straight-forward simplicity. Jeff Keller has rolled up his sleeves and given us the bare bones, straight goods on how your attitude determines your success.<P>Some books that I've seen in this genre are simply a tired collection of someone else's quotes, thrown together to hopefully inspire. This book does have an outstanding array of quotes, but they are used to complement an already solid, meaty foundation.<P>Attitude is Everything covers three basic areas: thinking, speaking, and acting in ways that support your success. Keller rightly says, "...there's more to success than just having a great attitude." He also shows you how to apply that great attitude as a catalyst to your success.<P>You will learn how to change your thinking, make a commitment, overcome adversity, form new habits, face your fears, risk failure and turn it into success. The final chapter alone, about the power of networking, is worth the price of the book. Five big stars!<P>Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory</span>

                    <span>Jeff Keller has written a great book on improving your attitude. It has short chapters making it quick and easy to read. He includes practical stories or examples to help relate to what he is saying, then tells you what to do. He doesn't make you feel stupid or like he's any better than you are. There's no beating-around-the-bush and no guessing to what he's trying to say. No big fancy words, just plain, simple, easy reading that really makes you want to change your attitude! It's money well spent.</span>
