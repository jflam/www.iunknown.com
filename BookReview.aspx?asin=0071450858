                    <span>Carl Erskine has written a book of sincere appreciation of former Brooklyn Dodgers' teammate Jackie Robinson for the role he played in Erskine's life and also in advancing the cause of civil rights in which baseball paved the way for the rest of the country to follow.  Part of the book covers the careers both had as teammates on the Dodgers and their almost yearly quest to dethrone the Yankees as World Champions in the World Series.  Some of the anecdotes can be found in other books, but there are some stories Erskine relates that I have never heard before.  Erskine relates the struggle Robinson faced in gaining acceptance in baseball to his (Erskine's) son Jimmy, a Down syndrome child, faced in gaining acceptance in a prejudiced American society. As Erskine relates, the Boys of Summer are now in their autumn as many of his teammates have passed on.  Carl believes that our experiences that take place early in our life are designed to prepare us for what is to come ahead.  A black friend he had as a young boy prepared him for the time when Robinson would become his teammate.  It's easy to see Erskine's affection towards Robinson.  Sometimes what appears to be a small kindness looms large in the one who receives it.  Carl Erskine pitched as a minor leaguer against the parent Brooklyn Dodgers' team, and after the game Robinson came over and praised Carl's pitching effort to him.  To hear this praise coming from Jackie Robinson meant a lot to him, and was something Erskine always remembered.  A chapter I especially enjoyed was Erskine relating a year 2000 trip he and his family made to New York and returned to Brooklyn to see the old neighborhood he used to live in while a member of the Dodgers.  The book is only 150 pages long, but whether you are of age to remember the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950's or not this is a book you will find to be of interest to you.   I give the book five stars for Carl's efforts to relate his experiences in trying to teach others the importance of accepting others for who they are.</span>
