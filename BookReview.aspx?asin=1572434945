                <span id="Label1">It was a season for the New England Patriots that resembled nothing more than a plot from "Mission Impossible:" from 70-1 odds at the beginning of the season to finishing as 14-point underdogs one fateful day in February.  The 48-yard field goal off the leg of Adam Vinatieri sailed through the uprights.  For one unforgettable suspended moment, Vinatieri&#146;s arms were raised, then the Patriots standing on the sidelines came crashing onto the Superdome turf, culminating in some of the most intense and heartfelt emotion football has ever known.    <P>Relive the historical significance of this improbable 20-17 win over the St. Louis Rams, a win that brought tears to the eyes of players, coaches, and fans alike.  This book will tell how the Patriots became one of the most surprising teams ever to win a Super Bowl, how they perfected their line-up and worked together as a team to achieve their goals and steal the title from the heavily favored Rams.</span>

                    <span>The 2001 Patriots may have been the greatet TEAM of all time and were led by the coaching equivalent to Einstein. Unlike the 2001 Rams the patriots worked as a colllective whole not as individuals. This book shows how the Patriots overcame the challenges that they encountered and tells the world that no one person in equal to the power of a team. The prolouge and epilouge show how unselfish even the best players on the team were and how they gave up all the glamour to win a title. In a world that is obsessed with the color green, the patriots showed the true spirit of the post 9-11 U.S. by chosing unity over anything else. In the way entire world looked upon the colonies struggle against England in 1775, the media gave the Patriots no chance of hoisting the Vince Lombardi trophy. The Patriots shocked the whole world with Vinitiari's kick and almost caused the Superdome to crumble with celebration. Belichick devised a game plan comparable to the D-Day invasion or Hannibal' Battle of Cannae. It may have been the greatest footballl gameplan of all time.<P>Cafardo portrays the Patriots excellently but make several mistakes on certain inforamtion. But the mistakes can be easily ignored when the reader reflects on the entire story.</span>

                    <span>If you want to relive the magical 2001 season, spend your money on Pepper Johnson's "Won for All" or the Herald's recap of the season, or the "Patriots United" coffee-table book.<P>Nick Cafardo, a Boston Globe sportswriter, has never shown much talent as a columnist, and his lack of ability is amplified in a work the length of a book. Even worse, in a book that's supposed to be about the 2001 team's march to the title, he couldn't help but continue carrying water for two of his favorites -- Terry Glenn and Drew Bledsoe, constantly making excuses for them. For example, out of nowhere and out of context, he inserts a laughable screed against anyone who dares to criticize Bledsoe. It's bizarre! It's as if he had this whole rant built up and couldn't figure out where to put it and then couldn't contain it anymore and had to stick it wherever he happened to be in the book.<P>Save your money and go elsewhere. Or if you do feel compelled to read it, use a library.</span>

                    <span>The least the publisher could do was put a subtitle on the cover that says that this is a poorly structured book of strung together game reports one could find in the archive of the Boston Globe.<P>Sheesh. If a fifth grader handed this manuscript in, he would get a D. One sentence paragraphs, factual errors repeated throughout the book (i.e. Pats were in Superbowl XXXI, not XXX; Jets beat the Raiders to get the Pats first round bye - not Bills beat Jets, etc.), disconcerting game reviews where the second half is reviewed before the first half, cliches, etc.<P>The Pats' championship season deserved a lot better than this.</span>
