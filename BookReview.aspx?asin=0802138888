                <span id="Label1">In The Eternal Frontier, world-renowned scientist and historian Tim Flannery tells the unforgettable story of the geological and biological evolution of the North American continent, from the time of the asteroid strike that ended the age of dinosaurs 65 million years ago, to the present day. Flannery describes the development of North America's deciduous forests and other flora, and tracks the immigration and emigration of various animals to and from Europe, Asia, and South America, showing how plant and animal species have either adapted or become extinct. The story takes in the massive changes wrought by the ice ages and the coming of the Indians, and continues right up to the present, covering the deforestation of the Northeast, the decimation of the buffalo, and other facets of the enormous impact of frontier settlement and the development of the industrial might of the United States. Natural history on a monumental scale, The Eternal Frontier contains an enormous wealth of fascinating scientific details, and Flannery's accessible and dynamic writing makes the book a delight to read. This is science writing at its very best -- a riveting page-turner that is simultaneously an accessible and scholarly trove of incredible information that is already being hailed by critics as a classic. "Tim Flannery's account ... will fascinate Americans and non-Americans alike." -- Jared Diamond, author of Guns, Germs, and Steel "No one before Flannery ... has been brave enough to tackle the whole pageant of North America." -- David Quammen, the New York Times Book Review "Tim Flannery's book will forever change your perspective on the North American continent ... Exhilarating." -- John Terborgh, The New York Review of Books "Full of engaging and attention-catching information about North America's geology, climate, and paleontology." -- Patricia Nelson Limerick, the Washington Post Book World "Natural history par excellence." -- Kirkus Reviews (starred review) "This gutsy Aussie may have read our landscape and ecological history with greater clarity than any native son." -- David A. Burney, Natural History "A fascinating, current, and insightful look at our familiar history from a larger perspective." -- David Bezanson, Austin-American Statesman "The scope of [Flannery's] story is huge, and his research exhaustive." -- Lauren Gravitz, The Christian Science Monitor </span>

                    <span>This is an outstanding book. Without doubt it is the best I have ever read on plant, animal, & landform evolution during the Cenozoic Era in general, & North America in particular. However, the only reason I don't rate this book at 5 stars is that it desperately needs illustrations. Tim Flannery, if you read this review, please put out a second edition of this book ASAP, but containing some 50-100 new pages of drawings & color images of all the major plants & animals described, along with maps showing changes to the North American land mass - its immigration routes from Europe, Asia, & South America, glacier advances, etc - for each Epoch of the Tertiary & Quaternary Periods. I also recommend that a geologic time-chart be shown at the beginning of each chapter, highlighting the time period being discussed, since I expect the general reader could not differentiate the Paleocene from the Pleistocene by name alone. Even without these illustrations, this is still a great read, but it would have been a lot more fun without having to keep a dozen other books nearby to look up pictures of each plant, animal, or landform change being discussed.</span>

                    <span>In The Eternal Frontier, Tim Flannery starts his ecological history of North America with the major asteroid impact near the Yucatan 65 million years ago. He writes of the catastrophe with great verve, and the book becomes quite a page-turner. From there he moves forward through time to the present showing the changes in climate and habitat, and then how the advent of humans in North America impacted its ecology. I grew up in Wisconsin, and I had no idea what a distinct climate and ecology the central portion of North America has compared to the other continents. Because the major mountain ranges (Sierra Nevada, Rockies and Appalachians) run from north to south compared to east to west (the Alps, Urals and Himalayas), North America has a "climatic trumpet" where hot air comes up from the equator in the summer producing near tropical summers even in Wisconsin, and then cold air comes down from the arctic in winter producing a sub-arctic winter. I hadn't realized that Europe and Asia don't have areas with such major swings in temperature as the norm. Flannery also explains how this trumpet will cause global warning or an ice age to be most severe in North America compared to the other continents. Flannery presents and explores in the latter portion of his book many theses on how he thinks North Americans need to take care of their continent so that life as we know it is not jeopardized. Many may think his predictions more dire than need be, but all are worth some careful thought, and many are new ideas (such as the need for large carnivores) that most people would not have thought of. All in all, The Eternal Frontier is a thoughtful, well-written and surprisingly exciting book.</span>

                    <span>I think other reviewers have pretty well covered the book. It's certainly a very interesting read. <P>I'm kind of an index nut. Some non-fiction authors provide very weak ones. This one is good, but surprisingly misses some important key phrases and words like "founders effect", his interesting Paleogene description on page 101 (paper back) and his references to dawn redwood early on. I certainly appreciated the color photos in the middle of the book, but, whenever I see such material in a paperbook, wonder if there was even more in the hardback version. Four leafs, 8 pages, were provided in the paperback. Anyone know if that's the same as the hardback? I've come across paperbacks that obviously had photos and figures that were excluded from the book. In some cases, that makes a big difference. I think I found two figures in the book. Maybe one. A few more would have been very helpful, partitcularly on extinctions and a few to summarize points.</span>

                    <span>THE ETERNAL FRONTIER is a fantastic book for giving a cursory ecological history of North America, and it presents the information so fluidly that it's easy to retain even for the layman. A year after reading it, I still think of the shallow ocean that once covered the midwest; of the armadillo returning northward from Mexico to reclaim what had once been its territory. Flannery's assertion that North American ecology has been out of balance since the clovis hunters is well supported also. But I found his suggestion for amending this crisis to be genuinely silly, almost to the point that it hurt the overall book. He believes it may be possible to re-introduce large mammals--namely elephants--to North America, thereby re-establishing the balance that existed during the era of the mastadon. This sort of plan exists in such a far-fetched dream world that it undermines the very sober treatise that has led to it. (I just don't see herds of elephants making it across I-80 in their southward migration.) Flannery handles a great deal of information in this book, and his ability to work with the large scale of time is impressive. But the book does overreach in its attempt to solve a thousand year-old problem in North America.</span>

                    <span>I rather enjoyed this book, though given its subject matter - discussing the evolutionary and ecological history of North America from the asteroid impact that closed the Mesozoic Era to today's environmental problems - it was perhaps a tad too sweeping. Epic, yes, grandly so, but sometimes I was frustrated that he didn't spend more time on a particular subject or idea that interested me. Arguably this was unavoidable given the 65 million years he sought to cover, but still I wished the book was even longer.<P>Having said that though, the book was quite wortwhile. Many aspects of the fauna and flora of North America were discussed. Quite a bit of space is devoted to mammalian evolution in the Cenozic, something that is hard to find in popular writings (I know, I have looked; there isn't much on the Cenozoic, particularly the Tertiary Period). Oreodonts, uintatheres, protoceratids, and one of my favorites _Teleoceras_ are all given attention. <P>Many interesting questions in North American evolution are raised and then answered. How did temperate forests come to be the dominant biome of most of eastern North America? What part did tree squirrels play in North American plant evolution? How did the bison become the vastly numerous species that thundered across the plains when the settlers arrived? Why did rhinos become extinct in North America? How did horses, at one time quite abundant on the continent (one fossil site in Florida he writes yielded no less than 9 co-existing fossil species), become extinct? Indeed, what happened to the Pleistocene megafauna in general, which included not only horses but mammoths, mastodons, ground sloths, camels, lions, cheetahs, and many other animals?<P>Though the book focuses on North America, by necessity other continents are discussed, logical given the many land bridges that connected North America at various times with Asia, Europe, and South America. I didn't know for instance about the great fauna interchange between North America and the then European island archipelago 55-46 million years ago, how the fauna of North America overwhelmed the archaic fauna of Europe, though some European animals did successfully colonize North America (Flannery writes that mockingbirds first evolved in the Eocene epoch, likely from starling migrants that arrived from Europe). He goes into more detail in the more well known Great Faunal Interchange between North and South America, where large numbers of species colonized new lands, as well the formation of Beringia in the Pleistocene, the great land bridge that brought over not only many Asian animals but also humans.<P>Though mammals seem to get much of the focus in the book, Flannery does discuss the arrival and/or evolution of birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and plants throughout the time period in focus in the book. I thought his sections on reptiles was particularly intersting, discussing those who survived the asteroid impact in the Gulf of Mexico and those who didn't for instance, as well as notes on the advent of rattlesnakes in North America. Plants are not neglected; his writings on the creosote bush I found unexpected and interesting as well, and as mentioned he spent quite a bit of time discussing the evoltution of arguably North America's most charasteristic biome, the temperate decidious forest.<P>Flannery by necessity discusses a fair amount of climatology, geology, and plate tectonics in "The Eternal Frontier" as well. Not to an overwhelming degree but enough to allow the reader to get "the big picture" and to see how these events relate to the continued evolution of life in North America.<P>As might be expected mankind is well covered in the book. Much time is spent on the arrival of the first Native Americas (he refers to them as Indians, acknowledging cultural traditions though noting the inaccuracy) as well as the evolution of the Folsom and Clovis cultures. The impact the native peoples had on North America is the focus for Flannery, largely their probable role in the extinction of the North American megafauna of the Pleistocene but also their impact elsewhere.<P>Finally, and sadly, there is a considerable section on what Europeans have wrought in North America, from the extinction of the great auk to the slaughter of the buffalo to the ivory-billed woodpecker to vast deforestation...all chronicled. <P>All in all a good book with a nice section of color plates in the middle. A bit more detail in some sections would have been nice though, but perhaps that is not necessarily a fault.</span>
