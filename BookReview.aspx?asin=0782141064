                    <span>What makes this book special is that it does not follow the PMBOK format of knowledge areas, but takes you through the entire project life cycle. It is very important for a would-be Project Manager to know how a project evolves and moves forward; and this book helps you learn that. 
<br />However, while it covers all the processes defined in the PMBOK guide, it is not very comprehensive enough and in certain areas, only scratches the surface. Also, the practice questions at the end of this book are very different from the type you would see in the real exam.
<br />To recapitulate, this book is good for you to learn the concepts and the project flow, but do not rely on this book alone to see yourself through the exam.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent. I read the PMBOK first and actually I didn't understand so many topics, then I bought PMP exam prep book for Rita Mulcahy which was excellent too, the situational questions, the tips, the material that is not covered in the PMBOK and may be asked about in the exam. All of them were great in Rita book. But, still I couldn't understand the whole process and the process interactions together, and it was difficult for me to connect the inputs, tools and tech., and outputs of processes. I tried to memorize them but this was difficult too. 
<br />
<br />This continued until I started studying from Kim book, it was exactly what I wanted and what I was missing. This book organizes the project management processes according to the process groups not according the knowledge areas, which makes sense and make you understand the subject as a whole and get the big picture. Before reading this book, I found difficulty in integrating the processes together and understanding the sequence of processes. But after reading it and from the first time, I was surprised how I could understand the whole subject and was able to understand and memorize inputs, tools and tech., and outputs.
<br />
<br />Another great thing in this book is the case study at the end of each chapter which begins with you from the first process of project initiation and ends with project closure and covers the professional responsibility also. This case study helped me a lot in understanding how project management processes could be applied practically. 
<br />
<br />This book is great, and in my opinion, the author has made an excellent job. I used this book with (PMP final exam review) for Kim Heldman too, and as I mentioned earlier with Rita book and sure the PMBOK, and for me all those four books were the perfect set and they complement each other, and I was able to pass the PMP exam with an overall score of 87%.

                    <span>While no one guide is perfect, this new version of Kim Heldman's PMP Study Guide is extremely good.  I looked at many others in selecting her book and the one by Andy Crowe to complement the PMBOK, and I thought she did an excellent job in laying out the details of Project Management.  In fact, none of the other books I looked at seemed to have the wealth of detail that I saw here (disregarding Kerzner, of course - the early versions of that book are really great for insomniacs, and it's very expensive).  I'm going to be teaching some project management courses next year, and am considering using this book and/or her book called &#34;Jump Start&#34; as texts.
<br />
<br />Andy Crowe's book was a good high-level guide, and I thought it complemented the Heldman approach very well by showing a different perspective.  With the help of these two guides, plus the barely readable PMBOK, I created some color coded drawings of the set of PM processes so that I could memorize each of the processes, and then try to tie in which inputs, tools/techniques, and outputs apply to which processes.
<br />
<br />Please bear in mind that the PMP is a very difficult exam, partly because the questions are so poorly worded, and many are very vague.  I have over 20 years experience in managing projects, some quite large, and have taught project management workshops to corporate audiences for the last three years.  I took every sample test available, many of them twice, and I particularly liked the CD of tests, quizzes, and flashcards that came with the Heldman book.  In fact, the flashcards will download to your Palm so that you can look at them when you get a chance.
<br />
<br />My score on the exam was 174 out of 200.  If I was to do this over &#60;and there's no way in hell that's gonna happen!&#62;, I would work through the Heldman book twice rather than just once.  One minor criticism is that she does not provide a 200 question timed test.  There's a lot to be said for forcing yourself to take a 200 question practice test as if it were under the real test's conditions.  You'll find it easier when you have to go through the real one.
<br />
<br />Good luck!  PMI is just now releasing the Third Edition of the PMBOK Guide, and a quick glance at the material looked like it was much improved over the 2000 version.  There are a lot of changes, most seemingly for the better.</span>

                    <span>This is a practical, easy to read PMP Exam study guide.  Unlike other exam preparation books that are organized by Knowledge Area, Kim follows the project process flow from initiation to closing using a case study approach.  The outline directly matches the process / objectives organization of the exam. The PMBOK(R) is organized by Knowledge Area, so supplementing your review of PMBOK(R) with an alternative approach that is easier to relate to real life project management is a good strategy.  This is one prep book that I continue to use long after successfully writing the exam. I used this book and companion CD as the key source book for a PMP Exam preparation course I gave.  My students agreed with my assessment of its value.</span>

                    <span>I do not reccommend this Study Guide, primarily because the editting of it was very sloppy.  There are misspelled words "Manger" for "Manager" throughout the book.  Also, be wary of the CD that is included.  It contains all of the materials and several bonus tests/exams, etc.  However, many of the questions/answers are incorrect.
<br />
<br />I reviewed/studied the physical book first and then did a second pass through the CD.  I discovered several questions/answers that were incorrect.  Very sloppy editting!!!
<br />
<br />I would strongly reccommend that you purchase a different Study Guide for the PMP Exam.</span>
