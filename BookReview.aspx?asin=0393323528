                    <span>Without beating about the bush, let me state that this is one of the best non-fiction books I have read on the effects of the Internet on our society. 
<br />
<br />The book starts with the account of Jonathan Lebed, a 14 year old boy from New Jersey. Jonathan last year made half a million dollars in 6 months, using nothing but his savvy and the Internet. Using accounts and AOL and E-Trade, Jonathan and had bought stock, then using multiple fictitious names posted hundreds of messages on Yahoo Finance message boards recommending the stock to others. As a result, the stock would go up and Jonathan would make a nice profit on the sale. 
<br />
<br />The book also looks into how another teenager, Marcus Arnold, registered himself as a law expert at Askme.com and soon reached the number one place in popularity. 
<br />
<br />Lewis explores TV feedback technologies like the ones developed by Tivo (stock ticker: TIVO) and Sonicblue (stock ticker: SBLU), and how these technologies could affect us all in the near future.
<br />
<br />Lewis has a lot of information at his disposal and he disseminates it in a fascinating way. He has a lively style of writing and a great turn of phrase. For instance: "The old hotshot capitalist was so narrow-minded you could use his brain to slice salami." It cracked me up.
<br />
<br />A great read. Highly informative, highly interesting, highly recommended.

                    <span>The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say --
<br />
<br />The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so.
<br />
<br />He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything.
<br />
<br />He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet.
<br />
<br />There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society.

                    <span>If you've read anything by Michael Lewis before, you know that he tells a story better than almost anyone.  For the first half of this book, he does that--telling his typically enlightening and entertaining tales about teenagers that have rocked the world through the internet.  After that, however, the book gets bogged down horribly, as Lewis analyzes the commercial and social implications of TiVo.  Page after redundant page of mind-numbing philosophical musings about the evolution of television advertising had me just about falling from my chair.  The final chapter was even worse--not just boring but, in my opinion, utterly pointless meanderings about the impact that technology might have on the human race.  Buy the book for the first two chapters, which are excellent, but stop after that or you'll regret the time you lost.</span>

                    <span>NEXT is a two-part book about progress; how it occurs, how it upsets the current status quo, and how it either continues on or is stymied by an establishment that becomes complacent with its earlier triumphs.
<br />The first part describes our rapidly changing world through the "outlaw" actions of young outsiders using new technology in unforeseen ways insiders could never imagine. The second part serves as an interpretation of how this new world is evolving and its implications for our future. About half way through the book the true genius of Lewis becomes evident. Sandwiched between the two segments, and acting as a bridge, is as good (and simple) a description as you will ever see (he puts it in terms and images even the most ardent revolutionary can appreciate) of how capitalism works and has been able to survive all these years. It comes off as a riff on the capitalistic mentality that would do Adam Smith proud, and spin Marx and Lenin around in their graves while putting our mainstream economists to shame.
<br />To quote from pages 135 - 137: "Socialistic impulses will always linger in the air, because they grow directly out of the human experience of capitalism. The neurotic, high-strung relationship between the outside and the inside was the market's new and improved way of dealing with the problem. Socialism hadn't been killed by capitalism. It had been subsumed by it. The market has found a way not only to permit the people who are most threatening to it their rebellious notions, but to also capitalize on them. Gnutella was one example of this; Internet was another...It was dreamed up by an academic with an anticommerical streak named Tim Berners-Lee. It was commercialized by a couple of marginal players in Silicon Valley - Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen - at least one of whom (Clark) was a sworn enemy of the big corporation. Five years later it was a mainstream commercial technology...Just as people needed other people to tell them what they were, ideas needed other ideas to tell them what they meant. That's perhaps one reason that people so explicitly hostile to capitalism were given a longer leash than usual; they posed no fundamental risk. [These] people...linger on the fringe until they dream up something that has great commercial potential. Then some big company swoops in and buys them, or they give birth to the big company themselves. Inside every alienated hacker [read: revolutionary] who thinks he stands for the `good things that ultimately don't matter to most businesses' there is a tycoon struggling to get out. It's not the system he hates. His gripe is with the price the system initially offers him to collaborate. The incentive for the outsider was to attack the inside right up to the moment he was co-opted by it. The incentive for the insider - and this took some getting used to -was to allow yourself to be attacked, and then co-opt your most ferocious attackers, and their best ideas...And in the end, those people give birth to the ideas that in turn give birth to fantastic wealth. The only thing capitalism cannot survive is stability. Stability - true stability - is an absence of progress, and a dearth of new wealth."
<br />Go back and read that quote again. It's priceless. 357 words that explain an economic mode of thought that has consumed thousands of pages and millions of hours of research, discussion, debate, attack, and defense, while creating the immeasurable wealth we all share in today, one way or the other. 
<br />Lewis then follows up (and ends) by expanding his scope to expose the rationale "the establishment" has used throughout history to solidify its place in society after it becomes complacent, diverting its creative energy into protecting the status quo rather than pressing on with the business of progress (read: competition). Using Sun Microsystems former chief engineer Bill Joy's April 2000 Wired Magazine rant giving credence to the Unibomber's fear about the survival of mankind in the age of computers, Lewis explains that it appears the old tech guard, the innovative minds that built the technology of the past 20 years, now realizes it is becoming obsolete at the hands of the new young turks who have taken hold of progress' baton and raced on, leaving them behind. 
<br />Here is where I wish Lewis' next offering would be a book about how progress throughout history has occurred in fits and jerks, frequently stymied because "elites" (standfasts) decide that things have advanced enough and it's time to consolidate gains (their gains). The rest of us suffer until the next phase of advancement breaks free of reactionary chains to ignite a new wave of technological progress destined to benefit an even larger consumer base. It is a needed book. 
<br />Another thing Lewis doesn't say is that we've been co-opting the machines we've invented ever since the beginning of time. Every machine, to use Marshall McLuhan's phrase, is an extension of ourselves. Just has the hammer and saw are extensions of our hands, so it is that computers are extensions of our brains. 
<br />In closing, Lewis does acknowledge the more positive aspects of technology as advocated by Ray Kurzweil ("The Age of Spiritual Machines" - 2000, and "Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever" - 2004), implying what we already know: the alternative to NEXT is what has always lurked in stasis - Death. It's what the NEXT NEW NEW THING has always been all about. 
<br />As famed Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Valentine said in an recent interview, "Nothing is revolutionary; it's evolutionary."

                    <span>Next: The Future Just Happened is about how the internet is changing the world. Lewis profiles Jonathan Lebed, a teenage stock market wizard (the SEC says he was a stock market manipulator -- Lewis isn't so sure); a teenage law expert who has never studied law; a teenager in England who is using Gnutella software as a springboard to, I don't know, take over the world, I guess.
<br />
<br />It seems obvious from the first half of the book that teenage boys are using the internet to become rich, powerful, and influential. So maybe all the internet has really done is speed things up by a few decades. But Lewis throws the over-thirties among us a small bone by interviewing an aging rock group that uses the internet to raise money for a tour, an eighty-something woman who participates in WebTV polls, and the creators of TiVo.
<br />
<br />The second half of the book is a bit unconvincing. Set-top boxes, big deal. Those teenagers rule the book, and it would seem, the world.
<br />
<br />Lewis, as usual, writes an engaging book, it pulls you right in and moves quickly. The Lebed story itself makes the book worth your time.
