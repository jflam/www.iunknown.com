                <span id="Label1">In <I>Women and the City: Gender, Power, and Space in Boston, 1870-1940</I>, Sarah Deutsch examines the relationship between the city's evolving structure and the choices and strategies of various groups of women. Her study follows the efforts of working-class, middle-class, and elite matrons as they struggled to shape the city to meet their respective needs. In succeeding, they redefined the moral geography of the city, and broadened Deutsch's own opportunities many decades later.<p>  Deutsch orders her study topically. The first four chapters examine the politics of everyday life, showing how the daily lives and domestic spaces of women were intimately connected to the sorts of claims they made in and on public arenas. Her final three chapters follow women as they organize and institutionalize their efforts, demonstrating the complex ways in which the relationship between women and the public terrain is specific to class, ethnicity, and historical moment. As the book makes clear, space "does not have independent agency." Its meaning and power are determined by how groups of people organize their social, political, and economic interactions. For the women of Boston, the ability to lay claim to certain types of space and the power to shape place were crucial to meeting their basic needs.<p>  A promising young historian from the University of Arizona, Deutsch breaks new ground in her analysis of women's role in shaping the modern city. Her thoroughly researched study makes frequent reference to individual biography, while illustrating a firm understanding of Boston history. Although her enthusiasm for detail and third-person narrative often obscures her larger claims, <I>Women and the City</I> clearly illustrates the ability of women to negotiate the urban terrain on their own terms. <I>--Bertina Loeffler Sedlack</I> </span>

                    <span>Not only the legal status but the personal outlooks of women changed immeasurably
<br />in the period this book covers; the subtitle speaks of space and power, but Deutsch
<br />has also given us a fine overview of intellectual change: what women thought, and
<br />why they thought in those ways, during an era of astonishing industrial and social
<br />development. Through her research, we can see why the women of Henry James
<br />were not the same as those of F. Scott Fitzgerald--and they were very different.
<br />
<br />We are used to sympathizing with the plight of working class women, and giving
<br />great credit to the founders of the settlement houses and political groups that helped
<br />them, but until now I had never realized how class differences affected attitudes, and
<br />how perfectly reasonable women of either set found great difficulty in
<br />understanding how those of the other thought and felt. This book has helped me get
<br />a better understanding of both groups.  
<br />
<br />In recent months I've been reading heavily in Boston history and in women's history
<br />of this period. This book is far and away the best thing I've found. Having done
<br />historical research using primary sources, I can tell you this author has done an
<br />immense amount of work, and it has paid off. She uses not only the minutes of
<br />meetings and legal reports, but personal letters and contemporary novels to tell the
<br />story. She writes clearly, and the book is well organized. If you want a real feel for
<br />the lives of women during a period of tremendous change, this book is the best place
<br />I know to get it. Deutsch straightens out a lot of misconceptions, and helps to clarify
<br />an extremely complex period.   </span>
