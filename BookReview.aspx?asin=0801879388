                <span id="Label1">The image was shocking: a couple wearing protective suits and masks in their own home! The accompanying <I>USA Weekend</I> story documented the mold-related headaches, fatigue, and respiratory problems that forced Melinda Ballard and Ron Allison to abandon their dream house, leaving all their possessions behind. Another family was so terrified that they had their mold-filled house torn down.  <P>Mold growth threatens property managers and builders, as well as home owners and renters. Legal settlements in some mold cases have reached the millions, and home insurance rates are skyrocketing. Some people argue that mold concerns are exaggerated; others are convinced that mold growth is destroying their health.  <P>In <I>The Mold Survival Guide</I>, a prominent indoor air quality professional teams up with a writing specialist to describe mold, to explain where and why it flourishes in homes, and to offer advice on how to eradicate mold while minimizing health risks. The book includes a chapter by two physicians who explain how exposure to mold can affect health.  <P>With clear scientific explanations and expert advice, <I>The Mold Survival Guide</I> is a valuable resource for anyone worried about a common household problem that can have serious consequences.</span>

                    <span>I think everyone who has a mold allergy should read this book. There is so much misinformation about this subject. Armed with this knowledge, I now know when home inspectors, realtors etc. are telling the truth. I also know what level of moisture and water damage in a basement that I'm willing to tolerate. Now I can buy a home with confidence that I won't be surprised when I move in. I feel much better able to identify moisture problems as well as assess whether the problems are repairable. The book also connects the home owner with so many resources for testing, remediation etc. I'm not a scientist, but I was able to get the message because there are so many pictures in the book. You will know what you are looking for after reading it.</span>

                    <span>This book provides clear and practical information to help you protect your health and your property from being damaged or destroyed by mold.<P>Mold is not just stinky and ugly. It has adversely affected the health of many people, especially those who are allergic to mold. Mold spores irritate the respiratory system and weaken the immune system's ability to remove particles from the lungs and to kill cancer cells.<P>Mold has made some buildings uninhabitable and uninsurable. Mortgage lenders avoid loaning money for the purchase of any building with significant mold infestations. Some families have already lost their home, including all of their equity, due to mold. <P>Jeffrey and Connie May have succeeded in providing practical wisdom gained from actually solving serious problems in homes and other buildings. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to solve and/or avoid mold problems.</span>
