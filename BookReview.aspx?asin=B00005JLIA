                <span id="Label1">Whether your intellect is completely engaged or passively detached, any viewing of <I>Naqoyqatsi</I> is likely to provoke a fascinating response. You can view it as a magnificent, visually stimulating music video (as critic Roger Ebert suggested you should), or in context as the third and most unsettling film in director Godfrey Reggio's "qatsi" trilogy, each titled from the Hopi language, and preceded by <I>Koyaanisqatsi</I> and <I>Powaqqatsi</I> ("Life out of Balance" and "Life in Transformation," respectively). "Life as War" is the translation of this film's title, and Reggio's theme is not one of conventional warfare, but of daily life as warfare in the age of rapidly evolving technology. The entire trilogy views humankind as a blight on the pristine nature of Earth, but here the theme is taken to its inevitable extreme: a constant flow of new and archival images--manipulated with solarization, digital enhancements, thermal effects, 2-D and 3-D animation, etc.--combine to convey athletic and military regimentation, culminating in the doomsday flowering of missiles, rockets, and all varieties of nuclear weaponry. The cumulative effect, when combined with Philip Glass's mesmerizing score (his best of the trilogy, with cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma) is one of doom-laden portent, but, as Stephen Holden observed in the <I>New York Times</I>, the film is also arrestingly beautiful as it weaves its hypnotic, apocalyptic spell. For those who wish to delve further, Reggio, Glass, and editor/visual designer Jon Kane provide valuable insight in a bonus panel discussion. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>The first two films of the Qatsi trilogy were made up of organic images accompanied by the music of Philip Glass. Astonishing achievements, they are, mostly because of this. The use of "found" images to tell a story - without dialog or a three-act screenplay - is quite an accomplishment.<P>So, in the third installment, what was left to achieve? The opposite: to tell a story with synthetic images, but also without reliance on dialog, characters, or formal dramatic structure. A purely abstract film, in other words, where every image could be controlled precisely. The result is Godfrey Reggio's Naqoyqatsi, which, in my opinion, is not quite abstract enough.<P>When relying on "real" images (i.e., representational) exclusively, you have to find metaphors and make connections indirectly. Koyaanisqatsi's most powerful example of this is a shot toward the end where we see an elderly person's hand emerge from an endless row of hospital beds seen obliquely so that they are nothing more than diagonal lines of metal and plastic. It's a haunting moment - humanity reaching out from the suffocating cocoon of technology it has woven about itself; reaching out for contact with something real. <P>But the computer-enhanced (and often computer generated) work in Naqoyqatsi goes for the obvious most of the time. Instead of oblique metaphors, we get transliterations: actual ones and zeros flying around the screen to represent information overload; corporate logos in 3-D zooming at us to tell us how pervasive they are - complete with the obvious Cheap Shot at Corporate Greed: the dreaded Enron logo; dollar signs raining on stock traders at the NYSE. And so on. <P>It's mostly clumsy. We even have a double-image of Dolly the cloned sheep intercut with shots of human eggs being artificially fertilized, followed by a big digital pull-back of lots and lots of naked babies, who are really the same four or five babies repeated endlessly. There is a certain aesthetic beauty in the work - the patterns are reminiscent of Salvador Dali's lattices of insects becoming clock hands; the periodic morphs, of his penchant for landscapes becoming faces. But as a whole, these images lack the elegance that marked the first two Qatsis. They're just too obvious.<P>That being said, Philip Glass' score is sublime. It's among his better works, eschewing strict minimalist formalism, while maintaining a minimalist kind of simplicity. It features some of the best Neo-Romantic orchestral writing I have heard in some time - a great counterpoint to the cold, industrial images of the film.<P>For the Completist, I recommend Naqoyqatsi. It's by no means a bad film. But for someone unfamiliar with the Qatsi aesthetic, I wouldn't start with this one. You need a grounding in the artistic sensibilities of the first two films to appreciate what does - and does not - work in this one.</span>

                    <span>Naqoyqatsi is a masterpiece!<BR>The conclusion of a visual and musical journey into the condition of human beings that started with the booming chorus of Koyaanisqatsi, and the technological advances that allowed men to conquer space,passing by the effect of globalization on cultures and diversity in Powaaqatsi, and ending in the last scene of Naqoyqatsi with a digitilized human floating away into oblivion in a darkness of nothingness that is space.<BR>It is a philosophical mind trip,almost psychadelic like no other film managed to take. But then again the 'qatsi' trilogy do not resemble any other film.<BR>The sheer power of images is the narrative, actors, plot and essential core of this unique cinematic experience, blended perfectly with the music of Philip Glass, and loosely connected by their main theme,but vary greatly from the intense,the fast-paced,the spiritual, to the haunting.<BR>Naqoyqatsi I felt was the closest to the original in terms of these images (the space rockets, the waves, the cars, the oil rigs..),and in terms of the initial message of director Reggio, and as such it becomes the prefect ending to this marvellous saga.<BR>Yet what distinguishes Naqoyqatsi from the other previous two films is the music of Glass. In the last of this trilogy, he SURPASSES himself, and manages to write his best work to date, pieces of classical music that at times have the same structure of Koyaanisqatsi but vastly developed,at others loosely inspired by Shostakovitch's Introduction in The Gadfly but remaining original thoughout. All the score enriched by the melancholic and beautiful cello of the hugely talented Yo Yo Ma. This music touched me like no other soundtrack or modern music managed to do in a long long time,and contributed greatly in itself to giving a breath of life to the barrage of digital images. Minimalist music never sounded more melodic and effective as it did in Glass's score for Naqoyqatsi.<BR>This leaves me with one point I have to make, which I think is vital, <BR>Naqoyqatsi should be judged and reviewed with all three films in mind and not on its own.<BR>Surely,by itself, it is a very ambitious and haunting piece of work, but when seen in the context of the whole trilogy as a fitting end to the journey taken throughout the three films,it becomes more poignant,and its impact much more effective.<BR>The constant digital images might not be to everyone's liking,but then again nor probably will the message of the film:the condition that the human race have reached in this unstoppable and virtually insane technological progress.<BR>These digital images can be seen as a mirror to that progress,that perfectly reflect that condition and the way we might very well be heading.<BR>Naqoyqatsi is a MUST buy, a film that will captivate your senses,touch you deeply and make you think hard, a feat director Godfrey Reggio should be applauded and praised for.</span>

                    <span>A Journey for the minds eye, portal to the unknow. This shows you nothing and everything. Projecteed in a way to let you interpret the data in your own way. To view in as they say [eye candy] A psychodelic exploration of our world as a whole, a raw naked experience of our existence and fetish love. Or as a vissual interpretation of the spectrum of our world and what we do to it and or create. I do not believe in any way that watching all three of the films you are missing much that is out their in terms of what everything is catogorized in all of our american lives. Corperate greed, lusk, ideals, growth, poverty, raw, over stimulization, love beauty, hate, audio and visual awakenness, To really show us who we are and what we saposidelly need. The film is pressented in an all visual scences, some things we can just see to fully comprehend, some things are better unspoken. If you get tired of the current sound track change it feel free to breath new life into it everytime you watch it, our world changes why shouldnt this. Jah Wobbles solaris works very well, Or any Bill Laswells records. This Is by far the most raw psyconavigated piece of work ive ever come in contact with. Be awaken by this reality dream of beauty and dismay. Dont be afraid the future is hear now.</span>

                    <span>Reggio has been lambasted to no end regarding this film, with most arguments against it more or less in opposition to his use of digital tools and technology in the creation of the visuals, the necessary bi-products of a digital, commodified age, a dehumanising practise which he is ostensibly critiquing. That criticism notwithstanding, the unending parade of seemingly arbitrary and/or obvious visual signs which are thrust at the viewer without much differentiation or care seems to frustrate viewers of Reggio's "art". I think that it is quite a stroke of genius to do this; in this film the form closely matches the content. It reflects the dreary, non-individualised, cyber/hyper consumer world very well, a world where the arbitrary image of a giraffe/zebra (on, say, a nature programme) can be set alongside an ad for coca-cola. There is no necessary link between the two, but we, as unassuming consumers of signs and imagery, do not notice this problem, it has become 'natural'. I believe that the imagery has been modified, warped (etc) to scare us into a realisation of how un-natural many of the ways we consume and see the world are. The critique proffered here has to be looked for. It is all on the surface. There is, necessarily, no depth to the film and its imagery.</span>

                    <span>Director Godfrey Reggio and Composer Philip Glass, in 1975, began work on a trilogy of films, that collectively take on as their dominant theme, the disintegration and fragmentation of modern civilized life. The trilogy begins with 1982's "Koyaanisqatsi", which deals with the "way of life" of the peoples of the northern hemisphere. 1988's "Powaqqatsi" speaks of the influence of that way of life on the more primitive peoples of the Southern Hemisphere. This 2002 film, "Naqoyqatsi", both explores and attempts to predict, what life will be like in the globalized world of the future.<P>All three films form an abstract wordless narrative structure, achieved solely through the use of traditional or digital cinematography, accompanied by a musical soundtrack from composer Philip Glass. The titles of these films come from Hopi Indian philosophies, yet the vision of the films is not that of the Hopi peoples, but primarily that of director Godfrey Reggio, who left a Christian monastic life during his teenage years in order to better engage with the world.<P>It is difficult to determine what influence that monastic upbringing had on Reggio's vision, however. In Christian apocalyptic literature, such as in "The Book of Revelations", a story is constructed "in which the secrets of the heavenly world or of the world to come are revealed by angelic mediation within a narrative framework". "Naqoyqatsi" is not properly a part of that tradition, though it's dominant theme still seems to be the disorder of a world which is rapidly approaching a tragic end.<P>Extreems of love and despair both achieve their psychological power in a person's mind by denying contradictory evidence of their opposite. Extreems of love deny any quality of flaw in the beloved, while extreems of despair deny any possibility of a future communion with goodness. Clearly, the theme of "Naqoyqatsi" is a kind of "totalism" of despair, which utterly denies any of the fragile joys we experience in this life.<P>The images we see in the film are all true, yet a viewer is compelled to make some sense of their own personal journey within this contemporary life. Indeed, one feels obligated to seek a meaning beyond the "Naqoyqatsi" message. Ultimately, that is why this reviewer does not find Reggio's vision to be personally satisfying, even though these films are an astonishing artistic success. Within the qatsi world view, Reggio leaves the audience with little hope of finding eventual solace.</span>
