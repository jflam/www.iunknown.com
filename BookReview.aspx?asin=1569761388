                    <span>This book helps. I used it with my kids, although it was recommended by my boss. It gives a straight-forward message with a lot of excellent examples of how to write your ideas using mind mappoing. I learned something about mind mapping a few years ago, but this goes way beyond that and is first-rate.</span>

                    <span>I own Nancy Margulies' first book on Mapping Inner Space and am so glad that the new one is full of even more ideas, lots more color maps and an expanded drawing section. I don't draw, or I didn't until I tried the symbols and exercises in the book. The main reason it is such a useful (and delightful) book is that the mapping process can be used for planning and presentations and improving communication skills. It would be excellent for students and teachers. I would also recommend it to people experiencing stressful life experiences, it really helps in sharing ideas and has helped me think in new ways.</span>

                    <span>This book has managed to take a very creative process and make it  doable for the less experienced. If you work with people and want to be able to, in an artistic way, but more importantly, a usuable way, record the unfolding work- this book is extraordinary. It covers so many differently arenas where visual mapping can support decistion making, creative thinking, and collaborations.It is the best book of it kind.</span>

                    <span>This is actually the updated version of the author's earlier book bearing the same title. It has been fully expanded to cater to professional and businesspeople, and is now packed with many colourful illustrations.<p>I am very confident businesspeople will find this book useful in enhancing and expanding their visual-perceptual mode of thinking and problem solving.<p>In this book, the author stretches the traditional boundary of mindmapping as created by Tony Buzan in his many proprietary "Mindmapping" books since the mid-70s. <p>The author breaks some traditional "Mindmapping" rules in the process, which she now calls "Mindscaping." This enables the reader to exercise the untapped and unlimited potential of the mind to create new working maps in the process of learning and thinking. <p>For professionals and businesspeople, her 'mindscaping' approaches can be adapted to suit any 'focused conversations' in a group or organisational setting.<p>I find Tony Buzan somewhat structured in his proprietary approach, and it is good that Nancy has done an excellent job to take a refreshing and "out-of-the-box" approach to traditional mindmapping. This gives much more meaning to the mindmapping process as it should be in the first place, and now makes it much easier to learn and apply in the real world. <p>For those readers who still think 'mindmapping' (or Tony Buzan) is great stuff, wait till you get hold of this book!<p>For beginners, Nancy's book is also a great help as she shows how to do simple iconic pictures. <p>For further exploration, I would recommend readers to buy and read Larry Raymond's Reinventing Communication, which showcases more business applications, particularly in the area of strategic planning. Milli Sonneman's Beyond Words is also worth exploring, especially in the area of group problem solving.<p>Kathy Mason's Going Beyond Words and David Hyerle's Visual Tools for Constructing Knowledge are also worth pursuing, especially if you are in the teaching/academic environment.</span>
