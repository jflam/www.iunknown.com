                    <span>I started reading this book in 2000 when I already had programming experiences with threads (Linux/SUN/SGI/Windows thread packages). This book is very helpful to improve my understanding of threads overall (not only Posix threads which is the focal point of the book).
<br />
<br />The most difficult part of thread programming is synchronization. This is where most problems arise in reality and most of this book's focus is on. The author clearly starts with various versions of implementation using different techniques (wrong or right) to help readers gain more knowledge. This (unlike one other reviewers claims to be confusing) is good writing style in my mind.
<br />
<br />There may be some misunderstanding from other reviewers too. One claims mutex is associated with both data and code. But mutex should always be associated with data (to protect data's coherency and consistency) and I don't see the book tries to associated that with code (its usage is certainly always in the form of code, which is the only way to use it). Another claims there is no downloadable code, which is wrong. The appendix of the book clearly states the URL of the downloadable source sample code (also include errata of the book). (...)
<br />The book is not without problems. The main issue I think is lack of introduction to popular Posix thread implementation. Almost no Posix thread implementation strictly conforms to the standard (this is also why some code in the book may not run readily on some implementation - make no mistake, most do). It will be helpful to explain different issues under different implementations and how to deal with it. The other thing is I found one minor problem with one sample code - it uses pthread_t type to do integer comparison which is discouraged by the author himself (this strikes one peculiarity of Posix standard: it uses opaque type for pthread_t, instead of scalar type which is very convenient to do such comparison in reality. Even the author as member of the standard committee is lured to do that).
<br />
<br />Overall, I think the book is worth at least 4 star and the money.</span>

                    <span>Richard Kirk's review below is the most accurate. There are many annoying things about this book. In addition, I find the code suspicious. For example the examples he gives of mutexes is to associate them with data items, even though the vast majority of the time they're associated with executable code. The discussion of critical sections is basically non-existent with very little explanation of the equivalent functionality in Pthreads. His explanation of semaphores is very difficult to follow and far more complex than it need be. I found better and simpler tutorials on the Web.<p>Butenhof is at his best when explaining the deep stuff and the subtle aspects of parallel programming. If this is what you need, the book is great. But if you want someone to show you how to use Pthreads and enable you to get up to speed quickly, then you will find this book rather frustrating. <p>The absence of downloadable code is an additional frustration. I'd go with the books by Bil Lewis, which are more straightforward and he offers tons of downloadable examples.</span>

                    <span>Butenhof covers all the details of programming the pthreads library.  The book begins with a lucid and carefully presented discussion about the general concepts behind threading, such as locking, synchronization, race conditions, and data sharing.  Threads can be a bit intimidating, but Butenhof's presentation makes threaded programming, and thinking about asynchronous design in general, much more manageable.  His coverage of the library itself is very accurate and clear.  The book helpfully contains a complete reference of the pthreads library.  Another worthwhile feature is the discussion and implementation of several common design patterns for multithreaded programming.  I have found myself modifying and reusing these patterns again and again.  If you find yourself needing to program with the pthreads library, Butenhof will not lead you astray.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I like to read books written that way.<p>To whom English is a foreign language an author's writing style <br>and choice of expression is sometimes the most important detail.<p>This book about POSIX-threads is for me. I respect THE OTHER <br>author's achievment. Also, I do not know how much of the <br>contents is outdated in either publication...<p>So, this is not about the quality of each snippet of Code, but <br>about the _usefulness of a book_ to teach POSIX-threads <br>comfortably to a complete beginner on the subject. <p>Take a copy, read some paragraphs from different chapters and <br>get an impression, before you buy any book on POSIX threads. <p>This one would be my first choice. :-)</span>

                    <span>I found this book very useful when learning about POSIX threads though the whole impression is a bit mixed. <p>The book gives everything you need to start writing POSIX-style multithreaded applications. Very complicated (in my opinion) issues of multithreading are explained very clearly. Every new concept is immediately illustrated with a sample code.<p>The appendix contains a detailed description of all mentioned pthread functions, so you can use it as a reference too.<p>At the same time I am not sure if book is completely up-to-date. E.g., in chapter 7 the author explains in details what is a read/write lock and presents a code with a mutex and 2 condition variables to use as an r/w lock. In the appendix he says that r/w lock can be incorporated into POSIX as a separate entity in future. I work with Solaris 8 and I found that r/w locks are already in my POSIX library.<p>The style of book is quite special, you may love it, or you may hate it. Sometimes the very basic concepts are explained in such a way and with so repetitions that it becomes even a bit annoying. Those bailing programmers are also a bit annoying. Quotes from Lewis Carroll seem a bit off topic too. Of course it's just my opinion.<p>In general I think the book worth its money and recommend it to everyone interested in the subject.<p>Prerequisites are simple: knowledge of C and general POSIX. E.g., I recommend a book by Mr. Gallmeister on real-time (non-multithreading) POSIX.</span>
