                    <span>As a professional photographer in the throes of a major repositioning effort, Selina's book provides valuable insight into how to carve out a single vision in 15 to 18 images, wrapped, packaged or otherwise presented in a way that supports that vision. The book doesn't pull any punches. It isn't for the on-the-fence photographer. If you want to win, you have to play to win. There is an investment in time, in money and in patience...none of which are particularly pleasant when faced with the uncertainty of a complex and ever-competitive market. My only disagreement with her - and the reason I rated the book 4 out of 5 stars - is because I feel that the biggest obstacle to getting an assignment is not knowing the right people. Salina thinks it's all about the work. I have found that my biggest assignments came from contacts in the industry. All of us who work on a national level are technically proficient, and most of us are bright, talented and driven. Yes, our styles cover the broadest spectrum imaginable, but what really seperates us is our contacts. With the onset of digital, photography as we once knew it is history. And that's the dirty little secret of this business...If it isn't perfect, we'll fix it in photoshop. My suggestion to anyone entering this field is to network like your life depended on it. Believe me, it's where the line in the sand is drawn.</span>

                    <span>Most commercial photographers know about Selina Oppenheim, but only a lucky few make the investment to hire her for her expertise in portfolio development and refining your vision as a photographer. Even though hiring Selina as a consultant was one of the best decisions I have made as a photographer, I still wanted to read her book to make sure I hadn't missed anything she has to say about marketing myself as a photographer. I can say from personal experience that this book distills the essence of her one-on-one consulting. This book is really, really worth learning from.</span>

                    <span>Selina Oppenheim is one of the premier creative consultants in the photography industry. Although no single book could possibly encompass her 25+ years of portfolio building and marketing experience, Portfolios That Sell gives you the opportunity to dive into her portfolio building process that she's used to develop so many exceptional photographers portfolios. It clearly and succinctly lays out the step-by-step process that you can follow to develop your own vision based portfolio. The photos that Selina chose to use as examples work well and will both guide you and encourage you to create new portfolio visuals.</span>
