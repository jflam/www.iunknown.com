                <span id="Label1">Idea Index kick-started a revolution in graphic design books, unique in size, feel--and most important--wealth of ideas.  Layout Index is the next step, a compendium of layout idea-generators that will help designers explore multiple possibilities for visual treatments each time they turn the page. The visual and textual suggestions are divided into eight major areas, including newsletters, flyers, posters, brochures, advertising, stationery, page layout, and Web pages.  <P>Each of these examples are designed to inspire effective solutions in the viewer's mind, rather than simply give specific answers to design problems. The tone and temperament of the design problems, as well as their solutions, vary from traditional to cutting-edge, from corporate to crazy. Designers will learn to solve their design problems, produce fantastic work and become better, more creative thinkers.   <P>* Both creativity books and layout books are extremely popular<BR> * As proven by Idea Index, the format of this book is a proven winner with designers</span>

                    <span>When you need that creative spark, this book is enough to get those synapses firing. Good design is good design... whether you are trying to come up with a good layout for a small black and white ad in the paper or an annual report, the hundreds of designs break the rectangular barriers in your head and get you thinking in different design modes.<P>The Web design section is a little dated in that the designs were limited by the technology available at the time the screenshots were made, but a Web designer today can borrow the clever designs for the newsletters and brochures and transfer those ideas to the Web.<P>No designer should be without this on their reference shelf.</span>

                    <span>I'm fussy about books in general, and I'm even fussier about books for my business. This book represents money well spent. It is so small, but don't let that deceive you, it is packed with ideas that springboard you into your own creations. I begin looking through the book when I feel I've hit a wall with ideas... soon I say to myself "hey, that is a neat way to handle things, I wonder if I could adapt that..." and soon enough I have my own design for the client. I have never seen any of my designs turn out like cookie cutters of the book's concepts...but I have had some good inspiration from it! I love the way this book gets me thinking.</span>

                    <span>Design inspired by this little book leans towards clean & well ordered displays of information. This book provides basics of page building & information distribution. <BR>Beginners will like this book, however, those looking for more complex layout ideas should either work on the existing ideas taking them to the next levels, or peruse other books.</span>

                    <span>This is part of a three book set, which is a great addition to any design library. Unfortunately, this is the weakest of the set - there are a few tidbits, but nothing much. If you buy the other two (Color Index & Idea Index) you will be set. This one I don't recommend to often.</span>

                    <span>I have been slowly building my Design Library, and this book made me laugh right out loud! Just by looking at the sample page excerpts offered, one can tell that this book is a total waste of money to anyone with a fine arts-based design degree. But, if you do not have any idea about design, and enjoy cookie-cutter, bland, out-dated design, or if you don't need much to inspire you, then this book would probably be just fine for your library.</span>
