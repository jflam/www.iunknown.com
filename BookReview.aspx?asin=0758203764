                    <span>I couldnt FORCE myself to read past chapter one. This is the worst book i have ever attempted to read. All the stupid names got on my nerves and the language was so juvenile. This is a pre-teen book. I will never read another book from this author again.I wish there was a rating less than 1 star, I wouldly surely give this book a negative 1 or less.</span>

                    <span>What an amazing, ingenius and wonderfully enlightening read. It's wonderful to see comedy used in such a profound manner. If you are looking for rocket science this is not it. If you want to read about church folks, and maybe you, this is definitely it. This is not relegated to the Black church it's in most churches; I should know- I'm a white woman. Those who have a problem with its simplicity may see themselves :-)
<br />
<br />Kudos to Ms. Walker. I also recommend Mother Eternal. It's a novel and superb. I will never take my Christian walk for granted.</span>

                    <span>I am so sorry but this book was not good , funny or anything resembling the word GOOD. It was very silly and I thought juvenile for adult reading. This was a waste of ny precious time. I would not recommend anyone purchase this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is kind of hard to review for me.  This book is a 3 at the most  anything above that is far reaching for me.  At the end I did actually did laugh out loud, some parts did tickle me.  Then she got a little too preachy and she mentioned herself in the book-something I hate for an author to do, (yes it is my own personal pet peeve).  The stories in this book are not that great and the way she named the character and the church was very tedious after a while but I didn't hate this book.  I didn't buy it either-1st book I ever got from the library because I usually just buy them but hey I was there so why not. Now if I would have paid for this book I would have been very upset. Why? There are several reason, 1.  The name thing does get very irritating after awhile. 2. The characters/situation where so unbelievable that even if you went to church you wouldn't be able to relate them to anything you have every seen, an all out brawl inside the church? How is that possible? Am I that na√Øve?   3.The testimony becoming an all out gossip fest.  No matter how money hungry your preacher was he would still try to have some decorum in his church-I would hope.  Something where hard for me to believe why and that is why I could not give this 4 or 5 star.  That said I finish this book last night and the funny parts where very funny.  If you read the book you will have to admit that the image of that old lady dropping the deacon was funny.  So I am glad I did NOT BUY this book but I am glad I read it...... </span>

                    <span>I tried for months to read this book.  When I ordered it from Amazon.com, I thought it was the story of a fake church woman.  I had no idea that the book was broken up into 7 different stories.  I found the stories to be ghetto and not funny at all.  In addition, the long names were annoying.  For instance, the name of the church is Ain't Nobody Else Right but Us--All Others Going To Hell Church.  Sure this is funny when you hear it the first time, but to hear this long name over and over got annoying.  All the other names got annoying as well, Brother Laid Handz, Sister Connie Fuse, etc..  I read books to escape.  As a result, this requires me to become one with the characters.  How could I become one with the characters if I coudn't even get their names right?
<br />
<br />If you are looking for a funny book about the black church, I just don't think you will find it in this book.</span>
