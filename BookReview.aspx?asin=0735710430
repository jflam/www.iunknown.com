                <span id="Label1"><HTML>Advanced Linux Programming is divided into two parts. The first covers generic UNIX system services, but with a particular eye towards Linux specific information. This portion of the book will be of use even to advanced programmers who have worked with other Linux systems since it will cover Linux specific details and differences. For programmers without UNIX experience, it will be even more valuable.The second section covers material that is entirely Linux specific. These are truly advanced topics, and are the techniques that the gurus use to build great applications.  While this book will focus mostly on the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the Linux kernel and the C library, a preliminary introduction to the development tools available will allow all who purchase the book to make immediate use of Linux.</HTML></span>

                    <span>This is very very usefull book for those, who have some knowledge in basic Linux or Win32 programming. It is very clear style of explanation, very usefull examples and detail review on key concepts. The authors try to learn us to write good, professional code and do not make some dummy faults.<br>If you want to be profi - this stuff is for you.<p> Vadim Kataev</span>

                    <span>I bought the "beginning linux programming" by Richard Stone and Neil Matthew( i listed the authors because there is anohter book same title) and I bought this one because of the hi mark and hope it would help my linux programming skill but I was so disappointed.  Nothing in this book is not covered by the BLP which even explaines better and more examples.  I thought advanced programming book should give in depth coverage of topics or techniques or common mistakes from beginner but this book doesn't not.  I usually buy book based on the rating if i can't check out at bookstore so I want people to know.  The decision is yours but check the book first.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I thought It would bring my Linux programming skill to another level but I was wrong(I m an SW eng doing C/C++/MFC programming and want to learn new stuffs). I would recommend the Beginning Linux Programming by (Richard Stones, Neil Matthew, Alan Cox). BLProgramming covered all the topics (except for ASM) and explained clearly with good examples than the ALProgramming.  I didn't see any advanced topics or new technics or in depth coverages. Whatever this book says, the Beginning Linux Programming say better and in depth.<br>Go to the book store and review yourself.<br>I usually buy books recommended by the users so i want to return something with this review. Thanks.</span>
