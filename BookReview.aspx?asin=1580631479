                <span id="Label1">It is beyond irony for Dick Morris, the man who has done as much as anyone in the 1990s to increase cynicism in the political process and encourage politicians to play to our worst fears and instincts, to turn around and say that politicians should be more idealistic because that's what people want. Yet that's the premise of <I>The New Prince</I>. Morris--who rose to national prominence by telling Bill Clinton what to say to appease Democratic liberals as he shifted party policy to the right--argues that the new pragmatism in politics is "to stay positive; to focus on the issues; to rise above party; and to lead through ideas.... Our candidates and office holders need to change their tactics, their focus, and their strategies--not in the interest of better government, but in order to succeed in their chosen line of work." Fewer people are voting, he says, but the ones who do are better informed, so message is more important than money now. Although he argued for early negative ads in the 1996 presidential campaign, Morris has seen the light, saying that "voters have moved beyond" negative ads. He also thinks Americans are sick of scandal, which is why the Republicans couldn't impeach Bill Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Arguing that politicians have to constantly take the public temperature to govern effectively--"Each day is election day in modern America"--Morris justifies the constant polling that he has used as a political tactic throughout his career. So what is leadership? Morris defines it as maintaining "sufficient forward momentum to control events and steer public policy without losing public support."<p>  Essentially, <I>The New Prince</I> is a handbook for politicians who want to get themselves elected, whether it be to the school board or the presidency, and on that level it works. But as a sage commentary on the state of politics at the end of the 20th century... heaven help us. <I>--Linda Killian</I> </span>

                    <span>This is an interesting read.  Morris describes how the new political system works.  Since he and his best bud Bill Clinton upset the political formula in the nineties, this was something to behold.<br>This book is chock full of good advice.  I can repeat them here:  have a message, focus that message to the voters, forget about the undecided-they don't vote anyway, stay positive, when the election turns dirty, focus on your opponents misrepresentations, etc.  I don't think Morris actually followed this advice, but hey, what do you expect from a politician.  <br>I think this is sage advice.  The messenger was bad.  Americans don't like dirty campaigns.  They want the message of what a person stands for.  This is a book about how a good campaign should be run.  For those considering running for an elective office, this is a very good read.  It is Politics 101.  I just wish the author was different.</span>

                    <span>I have seen Dick Morris occasionally on Fox News. He seems to be very intelligent, and his role in the Clinton administration is legendary. His book The New Prince is not just his version of Chris Matthews Hardball. Instead, it is a political self help book, loosely based on The Prince, by Machiavelli. It offers some very good advice, though it is not written for average people, like Hardball. There is also a shortage of stories to illustrate Morris's points. Instead of being a book for the curious, it is a handbook for a future politician. The most valuable part of the book is very applicable in the 2002 Texas Gubernatorial race: Focus on the issues, and don't rely on negative campaigning.</span>

                    <span>For many liberal Democrats like myself, Mr. Morris's plan to take the Democratic party rightward was a mixed blessing. <p>On one hand, it cracked the Republican stranglehold on suburbia that hardened during the Reagan-Bush years and insulated Clinton from appearing too soft--charges that had plauged both George McGovern and Walter Mondale during their respective candidacies. On the other hand, it appropriated some of the very same imagery and concepts that people such as myself found repugnant such as overly simplistic notions of faith and family. <p>Morris's observations come from a man who was in the trenches of what many people said was impossible past the 1960's--a two term Democratic adminstration that managed to retain the support of more solidly left groups on civil rights, reproductive issues and idenity politics while reaching out and embracing fiscal conservatives and moderates who would other wise believe that every democrat is uniformally of the "Tax and Spend" and "godless" variety. <p>Indeed, there is a certain irony that a man who encouraged the Democratic party to downplay some of it's most distingushing principles on social policy wound up himself subject to some virtrolic character examinations following public disclosure of a political affair of his own. Although the resulting fallout did not profoundly impact his boss's success, it did damage Morris's own ability to effect political change and realignment. <p>What had seemed creepy and moralizing before now appeared to be laughably hypocritical and ironically self-serving.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Morris' book is inspiring.  I read the original Prince by Machiavelli, but it was inconclusive and difficult to apply to today's democratic standards (although there are some things that will never change).  This book can be applied in all stations and situations of life, for all of these are relative.<br>     I believe that this is, truly, a guide to people--not just politics.  It is a worthwhile read.</span>

My department is also one of the best and the toughest to succeed in. I like this book because it is well organized and you do not have to read it cover to cover. You simply review the section you need advice on. I wish Morris would write a book about staying in the top ranks after you succeed.</span>
