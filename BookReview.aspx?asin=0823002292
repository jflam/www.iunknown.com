                    <span>I first stumbled upon this book when I was learning to do character animation with a 3D computer program. I found that I could learn the principles easily by doing the exercises in the book with my 3D software. Now I teach character animation, and I use Tony's section on the walk cycle to teach students how to do it in 3D. The book is clear and easy to understand, there are lots and lots of illustrations, and the price is great. If you want to learn character animation in 3D and you know little or nothing about it, this is THE book to get. It contains all the principles you'll find in higher-priced books on digital character animation.</span>

                    <span>OK.. So this is a bit bias.. But I have the pleasure of working with Tony in my 2D animation class. He is a great teacher and his book gave me a great understanding of animation and how I can apply these concepts to 3D. This is a great book to get started with! Good for 2D and 3D artists. :)<BR>It's more than worth the price. <BR>I just can't wait till his new book get published!</span>

                    <span>Amazing, my favorite book for anything at the moment. I'm using this mostly with Poser 4 (which is great and you should get) and Flash 5 (No, I haven't made the upgrade). This made my animations so much more fluid, it's actually sickening to look at my older work. Tony White is one of Zeus' (93) children.</span>

                    <span>Agreeing with all the great things previously said about this book, I can only add that "The Animator's Workbook" is the best book suited for artists just starting out in animation. It is thorough, practical and motivating, without being intimidating. If you know anybody - young or old - who wants to get into animation but does not know where to start, studying "The Animator's Workbook" is a great beginning.</span>
