<br />Read, enjoy and LEARN.  I am recommending this book to all our students on Success.org.</span>

                    <span>This book is truly great!! I am not very good at small talk and being a room full of people I do not know.  This book gave me great ideas on how to be more comfortable in these situations.  The tips seem so common sense but some of us just don't know them!! This book is also easy to read and quick to get through. I highly recommend it!</span>

                    <span>How To Talk To Anyone goes through 92 little techniques that you can incorporate into your communication to improve the way people perceive, respect, and respond to you. The book is written in several short chapters, only about 3 pages each.
<br />
<br />The author gives some great advice regarding body language, facial expression, how to read people, and how to keep the conversation flowing.  The author also goes into how to sound more pleasant on the phone and how to sound like a few knowledgeable person in almost any setting.
<br />
<br />The author does need to work on her humor as I found her sense a little dry.  She can also tend to come across and picky and shallow from time to time, but I suppose we all have to deal with these types of people anyway.  I also really would have liked all of the summaries given at the end of each chapter to have been listed again at the end of the book, to allow one to easily review the main points without having to flip through the book.
<br />
<br />However I really enjoyed this book and will likely be going back to it to refresh myself and to stay on top of the techniques mentioned.  A must read. 5 out of 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>This gives techniques of body language so that people will automatically like and trust you when they first meet you. This is not dumb stuff but things that really work. Things like "Sticky Eyes" where you keep your eyes locked on theirs.Then there is the "Baby Pivot" where you pivot your entire body to face someone you are just meeting. There is the "Slow Smile" where you start your smile at someone slowly so they don't think you beam at everyone you meet but seem more sincere. This is a very good book and it IS very tricky, but seems like very good advice.</span>

                    <span>I rated "How to make anyone fall in love with you" by the same author a four star. I think this book is even better, and certainly more applicable in general circumstances. Though I dont agree with the author's mildly negative comment on Dale Carnegie's classic "How to win friends and influence people" who wrote in the Introduction that Dale's book is not good enough for the much more complicated world nowadays, I would rather say Dale's book focused on mindset and strategies, whilst this one gave you many useful tactics. Both should be read seriously, if you want to be a successful warrier in the business jungle. Highly recommended!
<br />Â 
<br />p.s. The tactic I like most is called "The Tombstone Game" in page 226 Technique 59:- Ask the important people in your life what they would like engraved on their tombstone. Chisel it into your memory but dont mention it again. Then, when the moment is right to say I appreciate you ro I love you, fill the blanks with the very words they gave you weeks earlier. You take people's breath away when you fed their deepest self-image to them in a compliment. "At last, they say to themselves, "someone who loves me for who I truly am."</span>
