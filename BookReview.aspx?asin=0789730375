                    <span>Answering practice questions is an essential part of studying for the PMP exam.  This book gives you 500 questions covering all areas of the PMBOK.  I especially liked the "Answers and Explanations" section.  It was very thorough and explained in-depth why each response was right or wrong.  I highly recommend this to anyone preparing for the PMP and also to those that want to brush up on their knowledge.</span>

                    <span>I used this book in preparation for the PMP exam with other materials, and I can say it was key to my success. This book contains many shortcuts and timesavers. If want to hone your Project Management skills and pass the PMP exam, then I would highly recommend reading PMP Exam Cram 2.</span>

                    <span>I am so glad I made this purchase!  Reviewing this book along with the PMBOK is an inexpensive, yet extremely effective way to learn what is needed for the PMP exam.  The practice CD in the back of the book was also very helpful.  The CD takes you through exam questions in the same electronic format in which the actual exam is set up.  I would definitely recommend this book.  </span>

                    <span>This book is a very helpful supplemental resource to study for the PMP exam. I studied the PMBOK and the ESI Practice Test and Study Guide first and then went through the Exam Cram 2 Practice Questions. They were very helpful in my final preparation for the PMP test. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is preparing for the PMP test.</span>

                    <span>I am happy to report that I passed my PMP test on the first try. I studied Francis's book, and PMBOK for 5 consecutive weeks in addition to taking several practice questions from Phillips, Rita, and Heldman's book. You can probably get as much as 60-80% of the necessary knowledge to pass the test from Fracis' and PMBOK guide alone but will most definitely need to study/review other sources even if you have extensive managerial experience. Francis' book gets to the point and reviews the main concepts not covered in the PMBOK namely professional responsibility, and conflict resolution. This book is fairly an inexpensive option over the other books out there.
<br />Good luck to all future test takers.
<br />Regards,
<br />Jose Fajardo, PMP  </span>
