                    <span>This book is a must for the consultant who wants to increase their earning potential and move their career to the next level.
<br />
<br />It has been an invaluable resource to me personally and I have been able to apply the techniques and practices to my day-to-day work as well as to my overall career management.
<br />
<br />After reading through a large volume of books regarding consulting I can strongly recommend this book and many of the other titles that Alan has produced over the years.

                    <span>Mr. Weiss has put together quite a book full of usefull information. Much of it he has written on before, but that is not meant as a detraction. He has pulled what is most usefull out of much of his previous material and put it together into a systematic and straight-forward manual for running a successful consulting practice. While much of the advice seems 'common-sense' when you read his words, if it were truly so common he wouldn't have needed to write about it! While I may not agree with all that he has put down on paper in this book, I certainly think that there isn't a thing in it that would not be of use to many of the consultants out there today.

                    <span>While Alan Weiss has written Getting Started in Consulting for the newcomer, and Million Dollar Consulting for the consultant with experience beginning a solo practice, this book is for far more sophisticated consultants who are already doing well but wish to get to the next level. As always, Weiss is practical about finding the buyer the first time, setting high fees, writing brief proposals, and acting ethically, and also includes advice on how to enjoy the fruits of your success. This book also is the first in an excellent seven-book series specializing on issues such as fees, sales, life balance,and so on. It's a terrific resource for the successful consultant looking for even greater growth.</span>

                    <span>After having spent almost twice the money for this book than Alan's "Million Dollar Consulting", I found little to no new information.  Take my advice: buy a copy of Alan's wonderful "Million Dollar Consulting" and spend the savings elsewhere in your practice.  Good luck.</span>
