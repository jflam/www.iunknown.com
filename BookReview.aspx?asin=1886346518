                <span id="Label1"><I>Understanding the Golf Swing</i> will show you a different, simpler approach to the golf swing.  Manuel de la Torre, twice named by Golf Magazine as one of the top 100 golf instructors in America is the leading modern day proponent of Ernest Jones&#146; Swing Principles method of golf instruction. The book includes a passionate Foreword by Carol Mann, Member LPGA, Hall of Fame.  <P>The de la Torre (and Jones) system presents a simpler approach to the golf swing, the emphasis being on the development of a true swinging motion, devoid of energy robbing leverage. In this view, &#147;if the club is used properly the body movements take care of themselves.&#148; This simple statement has the power to bring aobut profound improvements in your game.  <P>While presenting a simpler approach to the golf swing, the book is also a comprehensive resource for all levels of golfer, from the beginner to the professional. It includes:  <P>&#149; The most thorough analysis of ball flights found in any golf instructional book.   <P>&#149; Detailed discussion of special shot play, including sand play, pitching, chipping, putting, and playing unusual shots.  <P>&#149; Coverage of the mental site of golf, effective course management, and a formula for taking your best practice tee shots to the golf course.</span>

                    <span>Having attended his seminars and studied his teachings for two years, we revised our golf school's curriculm to comply fully with Manuel's approach to the game. Students are relieved by its simplicity and delighted by its effectiveness. As opposed to the typical golf description that is too often dispensed for teaching the game, we call his work "poetry of golf instruction." It is brief, vivid, and gets the job done.<P>From a discipline that comes from 60 years of teaching, Manuel is very careful with his words and that pays big dividends when reading his book. All of our students buy the book and find it to be a valuable reference.</span>

                    <span>Manuel de la Torre has written a wonderful golf book. His simple method really is simple and it makes so much sense. A number of the reviews here have described this swing as swinging the clubhead over your shoulder with your hands and the club down with you arms. However, de la Torre defines arms as the upper arms and says that the forearms should not take over. I found this very helpful as when I focus on swinging the club down with the upper arms I don't cast or come over the top. When I focus on my arms rather than my upper arms I have problems much more often.<P>Being able to focus on a simple method to swing correctly rather than on what "mistake" I made is great. If I have a poor shot I simply focus on swinging as de la <BR>Torre recommends rather than trying to figure out what I did wrong. This book is worth reading more than once as there are some subtleties to his simple swing that are worth understanding.</span>

                    <span>Manuel De La Torre has done a great job of explaining the concept of the true golf "swing" first espoused by the late great Ernest Jones and recently built upon in my book, "Golf's Timeless Fundamental" (Globe Pequot Press 1997). De La Torre's explanation of the backswing and the forward swing is particularly illuminating and is alone worth the price of the book. Highly recommended for those seeking to move beyond the latest "quick fix" offered by so many articles and books and to developing an understanding of the true golf "swing".</span>

                    <span>I think this book is a classic and I recommend also getting the companion DVD; however it does belong to the small muscle swing theory school - an approach that some disagree with. The small muscle school emphasizes the swing through the smaller muscles of the hand and arms rather than the large muscles of the legs, back, hips and trunk.<P>De La Torre's swing thought is that you swing back the club with your hands over your right shoulder (you DON'T lift the club as another reviewer erroneously remarked) and then swing forward with the upper arms (the portion of the arm between the shoulder and elbow). The rest of the body should move in response to that action. For example, you don't concern yourself with the weight shift. If you swing properly (as De La Torre defines it) and your body is responsive then you will shift your weight naturally and in proper rhythem.<P>I found this to be a great help because it removes the complication of trying to time the weight shift to the actions of the swing - and it works.<P>For me.<P>But I have noticed that just about every golf instruction book works for someone for some length of time. In the end the secret of the golf swing is to learn the proper feel of the true swinging action and to be able to replicate that feel with consistency. Everyone's path to learning that feel will differ because we are all individuals.<P>Still, De La Torre's work follows in the footsteps of one of the pioneers of swing theory - Ernest Jones. This book and the companion DVD is a great followup to his original theory and anyone who is interested in learning the swing should definitely study this book.</span>
