                <span id="Label1">Longtime activist, author and political figure Angela Davis brings us this expose of the women's movement in the context of the fight for civil rights and working class issues. She uncovers a side of the fight for suffrage many of us have not heard: the intimate tie between the anti-slavery campaign and the struggle for women's suffrage.  She shows how the racist and classist bias of some in the women's movement have divided its own membership. Davis' message is clear: If we ever want equality, we're gonna have to fight for it together.  </span>

                    <span>is tainted by racism and classism as well as their alliance with the white elite in oppressing many different peoples at different time periods up to today.  I recommended the book to those who want to know about the racist/classist origins of the feminist movement.  
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, I'm just as concerned about the plight of women as the next person, but the truth needs to get out.

                    <span>This book, or at least excerpts from it, should be a must read for everyone.  Davis presents a side of the suffragette movement, the first wave of feminism, that many people will never be aware of--the conflict between women's rights and African American rights, and the underlying racism of the movement spearheaded by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  Davis then effectively juxtaposes the first wave of feminism with the second wave of feminism in the 1960-70's to show the correlation between the two movements.  <p>In both cases, the fight for African American rights took prescedence over the rights of women.  While during the first wave of feminism, black women were ignored by the suffragettes, during the second wave of feminism, black women were faced with the choice of going forward in a women's movement that, once again, didn't really include them, or supporting the rights of African Americans as a race.  A difficult choice.  Davis clearly elucidates the failings of the both waves of feminism to include ALL women and shows how necessary it is for women, regardless of race, to work together.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Davis is an excellent writer! This book can serve as a textbook or a book to highten your awareness into historical facts concerning race, class and gender. I bought this book in an attempt to carry on an intellectual conversation with other about the subject who were far more informed than I.  As I read the book and talked with my friends, I realized that I was not only learning but understanding the information to the point where I could correlate my new found knowledge with other aspects of struggles for equality.  I highly recommend this text - you won't be sorry.</span>
