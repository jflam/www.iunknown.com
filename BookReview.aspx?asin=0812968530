                <span id="Label1">Tony Kornheiser is back. Within these pages, the celebrated <i>Washington Post </i>columnist, Pardon the Interruption cohost, and ESPN radio personality relates his experience as an OnStar user, the proud new owner of the Ronco Showtime Rotisserie & BBQ, and a &#8220;phone-a-friend&#8221; on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And in between, he dishes political commentary on Monica and Bill and George W. and Al. New for the paperback edition is Tony&#8217;s final Washington Post Style column. So read all about his quest to fit into size 36 Dockers and his struggle to buy holiday gifts. And know that in the process you&#8217;re handing this Kornheiser guy way too much dough for these columns.</span>

                    <span>Tony Kornheiser reissuing his mildly amusing columns in book form for the American public: Classic!<P>Tony Kornheiser consistently shilling his wares ad nausem to the point of submission: Not Classic!<P>I was flipping through the channels a couple of months ago when I landed on a show called "Pardon the Interruption" (heretofore known as PTI). I found myself captivated by the orange talking head we all know as Tony. His sparring sessions with Michael Wilbon were so entertaining, I automatically set the TiVo to tape this show every day so when I got home from work, I could see these two bicker until their heads spin.<P>About a month later, I found Tony's show on ESPN Radio. This show is even better than the PTI show, because it's just Tony whining and complaining about every little thing (similar to another person I'm a big fan of, David Letterman, except in a more incessant, New Yorker tone). Finding out that Mr. Tony is also a fellow displaced Long Islander, I became an instant fan.<P>I also noticed that Tony had three books in publication. I've read two of them (Bald As I Wanna Be and Pumping Irony), and I found them to be endlessly entertaining, albeit a little dated. I'm sure some of these columns from "I'm Back For More Cash" (credit Denis Horgan, Jr. for that one) will seem a little dated (I mean, how long ago was that Clinton stuff?), but I'm sure you'll still be able to find a laugh in every page, like Larry King did in "Bald as I Wanna Be" (Which I'm still fact checking to see if his recommendation might have been a little flawed).<P>And since Mr. Tony has consistently shilled his book on his radio program, you have no choice but to purchase this book. He's brainwashed us all. The next thing he'll want you to do is buy merchandise with his name on it... Oh wait, it's too late!<P>Get this book, because you should be entertained by it. Rack it. I'm out.</span>

                    <span>This book is very funny. Sure, the author is not funny like Robert Benchley was funny but it does ellicit a giggle or two or three. Then again, Benchley had a rather boring skin tone and didn't dash around town wearing a cape. As noted in other reviews, this book is a collection of Mr. Kornheisers columns written while he was an actual working writer of humor columns for the Washington Post. Since it is a collection, there should be something here to entertain just about anyone. As a matter of fact, with the holidays in full frantic depressing overdrive, why not cheer up your pals with this lively book? My advice is to wrap it up in paper instead of stuffing it into a stocking. I've tried to stuff it in my x-mas stocking and it was patently obvious that it was a book. No surprise there. Anyway, get this book for yourself and all your friends, if you have any.</span>

                    <span>and incredibly funny. Tony strikes again with a collection of Washington Post Style columns on a wide array of topics from Clinton to south Florida retirees to the weatherman. A classic American literary piece its not, but for light, entertaining reading it wins out. Be careful where you read it - I laughed out loud on more than one occasion. Enjoy.</span>
