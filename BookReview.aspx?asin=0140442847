                    <span>The Dhammapada is one of the world's great religious classics, and its pithy, poetic style makes it very direct and inspiring.  Like some of the other reviewers, I don't read Pali, and it's probably true that this isn't the most literal translation. However, I've read several translations of the Dhammapada and this has been my favorite for a long time.  In any translation of a poetic nature, the translator must choose a certain balance between a strictly literal translation of the source material and a poetic rendering of the material in the target language, and Mascaro leans a little toward the latter.  I've been a student of Buddhism for some years, though, and I find very few places where Mascaro's translation seems to be inaccurate --- even though there are other translations that may be a little more precise and literal.  In any case, there are many Buddhist philosophical works where precision of terminology is critical, but, since the Dhammapada is a more general work consisting mainly of aphorisms,   it's one work where a little poetic license seems acceptable.</span>

                    <span>Having read Max Muller's over 100 year misleading translation, Carter's and Palihawadana's philosophical, dry, but excellent translation, which, with annonations builds up whole buddhist philosophical system, Mascaro's translation is deeply disappointing. While I can't understand Pali, Carter's translation is -or at least seems to be very convincing translation. Mascarara's translation is beatiful and poetic but has same grave philosophical errors than Muller's outdated translations. Let's see one example.<p>Chapter one, verse one is translated by Muller as: <br> All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage<p>Mascaro's also misleading translation goes like:<br>What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and out present thoughts build our life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our mind.<br>If a man speaks or act with an impure mind, suffering follows him as the wheel of the cart follows the beast that draws the cart.<p>But Carter's et al. translation reveals the (propably) true (philosophical) meaning of the verse:<br>Proceeded by perception are mental states,*1<br>for them is perception supreme,<br>from them perception have they sprung.<br>If, with perception polluted*2, one speaks or acts, <br>Thence suffering follows<br>As a wheel the draughts wheel ox's foot.<p>annonations of Carter's book:<p>*1 perception...mental states: the pure event of seeing, hearing, smelling etc. an object is Â'perceptionÂ'; the concurrent rise of attachment, hate, anger, desire etc. with regard to it Ã­s the mental states.<p>*2 polluted: that is, with mental states such as anger.</span>

                    <span>The Dhammapada is one of the essential works of Buddhist scripture, and this book represents Juan Mascaro's translation of that timeless classic from Pali into English. Not knowing Pali, I cannot judge the linguistic accuracy of Mascaro's translation. But as a lover of both poetry and spiritual philosophy, I can say that this English text is a quiet masterpiece.<p>The text is divided up into 423 short verses, each of which represents a teaching of the Buddha. This is one of those marvelous books which one can open at any page and begin reading. Often poetic, often practical, but always intriguing, the Dhammapada invites the reader to return again and again. Through its verses we can hear the Buddha challenging us to look at life from a radically new perspective; we hear him encouraging us to break free from the psychological prisons which we too often help build ourselves.<p>Also fascinating is Juan Mascaro's substantial introduction, in which he discusses the life of the historical Buddha and puts his legacy in a broad context that is both multifaith and multicultural. Scholars of comparative religion will probably be as interested in Mascaro's introduction as they are in the actual translation of the Dhammapada.<p>In the Dhammapada, we read, "Better than a thousand useless verses is one single verse that gives peace" (verse 101). Juan Mascaro's version of the Dhammapada is certainly a beautiful work of literature. But it is also a profoundly moving spiritual classic. Whatever your religious inclination (or lack thereof), you just might find in this wonderful book some verses that do indeed bring you closer to inner peace.</span>

                    <span>I have not read the Dhammapada in the original Pali, and therefore cannot comment about this particular translation's accuracy.  What I can say is that this is certainly one of the most readable and fluid translations that I have read. A very enjoyable read.</span>

                    <span>It may read well but it is one of the worst translations of the Dhammapada available and you're better off finding any other translation but  this.<p>It is more an interpretation using poetic terms than a translation  of the original which is often more grave or more subtle.<p>The editors of  Penguin should update their Dhammapada Penguin classics version without  insulting readers' credibilities for too long.</span>
