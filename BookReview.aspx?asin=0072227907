                    <span>I read and study a lot of different programming languages. After reading the review from others who also bought this book I was convinced this book was for me. I am now halfway done reading and interacting with the book. The author is awesome. He takes you step-by-step in learning JavaScript. After each chapter he has hands-on assignements that build from one chapter to the next.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book, especially for the money. It is what it claims to be, "A Beginner's Guide." Don't look here for advanced javascript (only the last chapter deals with that). I bought this book with little understanding of Javascript. After reading this book, I have the foundational skills I need write Javascript. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Web design has gone through major changes over the years and with the addition of JavaScript web pages have so much more excitement to them. After reading this book and working with examples I was able to create basic JavaScript code and add things to the web pages.<P>The book is an excellent learning tool and easy to follow along with. The title is a Beginner's guide and there could not be a more exact description. The book has the step by step examples and each project has review questions.<P>The book lacks a cd with any tools or examples, although you can get free files from the internet. In updated version this might be something to add. The book takes you from getting the script in web pages to frames and forms.<P>If you new to Javascripting or have a need to brush up on some things, than you may want to get a hold of this book. Overall this is by far the best beginner text I have had a chance to work with.</span>

                    <span>I have really enjoyed the "Beginner Guide" series that McGraw-Hill has recently begun producing. They serve as a great introduction to various topics, and their newest JavaScript book is no exception. If I were to learn JavaScript all over again, this is the book I would want to have helping me along the way.<P>This book starts out at the very beginning-it assumes you don't know anything about JavaScript, variables, or functions and goes through what each of those are. After a good introduction into basic programming via JavaScript, there is a thorough discussion on each of the arithmetic and comparison operators in JavaScript. The rest of the book gets into the nitty-gritty of writing web pages with JavaScript by going over conditional statements, event handlers, and the DOM.<P>Through this discussion, you learn how to use JavaScript with HTML forms, frames, arrays, how to handle various types of data (e.g. string vs. date time), and even learn how to use JavaScript for image rollovers-the most basic of DHTML. Really this book covers the basics. If you go through this book and really understand it, you'll understand the critical skills you'll need to effectively use JavaScript. I would highly recommend this book to someone who doesn't know anything about JavaScript and needs a place to begin.</span>
