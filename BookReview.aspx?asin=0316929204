Preferences: car phones, domestic wine, Land Rovers."</i><p>  If this sounds like you, then you're a part of what's known as the "Winner's Circle" cluster. If not, then you probably fall into one of 61 other lifestyle clusters with names such as "Urban Gold Coast," "Pools & Patios," "God's Country," "Golden Ponds," and "Shotguns & Pickups." In <I>The Clustered World</I>, demographic detective Michael Weiss draws on the work of market research firm Claritas and its PRIZM cluster system to render a richly detailed view of the many neighborhoods and demographic segments that make up the United States. According to Weiss, the image of America as a melting pot is simply inaccurate--think <i>salad bar</i>, instead. He writes, "For a nation that's always valued community, this breakup of the mass market into balkanized population segments is as momentous as the collapse of Communism.... Today, the country's new motto should be '<i>E pluribus pluriba</i>': 'Out of many, many.'"<p>  In addition to explaining the cluster concept, Weiss shows how marketers can put clusters to work to understand consumers better and sell everything from college educations to Dodge Caravans. Weiss also looks beyond the U.S. population to lifestyle clusters in Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, South Africa, and Spain. Marketers and social observers will find this pointillist view incredibly useful and perhaps a little disturbing. The overriding truth behind <I>The Clustered World</I> is that, like it or not, "<i>You are like your neighbors</i>." And in case you're wondering what cluster you belong to, Weiss includes the URL for the Claritas Web site (yawyl.claritas.com), where you can enter your ZIP code to find out more about you and your neighbors. <I>--Harry C. Edwards</I></span>

                    <span>I read Michael Weiss' first book-"The Clustering of America" years ago, so when I read about his latest-I bought it as well. It is a real fun read-not just statistics etc..., but a lot of fun facts about people and their purchasing habits. My town was actually classified in the book as "Executive Suites" which made it even more interesting to read.(Pretty accurate description as well) Michael Weiss also used Berwyn, Ill. as an example of "Big City Blend" and he hit the nail on the head there. ( I have some older relatives who live in Berwyn). I started by flipping back and forth in the book, then just settled down and read it all the way through. I like demographics, and marketing, so that is another reason it held my interest. There were some surprises-ex: Price Club is popular with the "Blue Blood Estates". There is also some mention of foreign countries, and how they use the cluster system in marketing. The descriptions of the clusters are interesting, and take current events into account. It is a good book just to keep around to flip through to try and find communities you are familar with and see if the descriptions hold true, or read it all the way through. Either way-it's entertaining.</span>

                    <span><P><BR>When Howard Dean used the shorthand expression "guys with confederate flags on their pick-ups" he was actually talking about what some call "NASCAR dads" and Michael Weiss calls the "Shotguns & Pickups" cluster (number 29 in his first book, number 43 in this advanced and improved edition).<P>Although others have written about the nine nations of North America (Joel Garreau), various "tribes" across the nation, and demographics in general, Michael Weiss stands head and shoulders above all of them in providing the definitive reference work that is also a form of novel about America. <P>With this book he also begins the process of extending his ideas to he world, showing how neighborhoods in 19 countries can be classified into 14 common lifestyles, the bottom three being Lower Income Elderly, Hardened Dependency, and Shack & Shanty....billions of people disenfranchised by amoral capitalism, whose desperate circumstances have not quite made themselves felt, yet, in America.<P>I have only one major criticism of this book, apart from its obsession with understanding people in order to sell to them--it fails to go the extra mile in understanding the future consequences of each group's economic status and consumer preferences. Although the book very specifically addresses the politics of each group (predominant ideology, 1996 presidential vote, key issues), it lacks the transformation analysis that might be helpful in understanding the political economy dynamics of each group, and what might be required to craft a new national progressive consensus that reduces materialism, corruption, waste, and restores democracy, community, and sustainable national security and prosperity.<P>Regardless of this modest shortfall, this is an extraordinary book, as was the first that I also own ("The Clustering of America"). Those interested in how these clusters are coalescing into a new progressive movement that is in-front, deep green, against big business, big money in politics, and amoral globalization, might wish to read Paul Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson "The Cultural Creatives", Google for "Cultural Creatives" or visit culturalcreatives.org. America is changing. This book by Michael Weiss is a brilliant snapshot of where we are today.</span>

                    <span>Weiss gives an entertaining and well-written overview of how geodemographic profiling works. He explains the concept, compares the US profiling to other countries, and talks about its applications in marketing. Finally, he provides a breakdown of the 62 PRIZM clusters that existed at the time that the book was written. It may not be the book to learn about the US (but I don't think it's useless in that regard) but it's definitely the book to learn how marketers see the US.</span>

                    <span>I expected something a little more from this book. It breaks down groups of people/markets into clusters and gives descriptions of the clusters one by one. There is not a lot threading it together. Granted, I gave it a quick look and put it on the coffee table for a couple of months. But, I was underwhelmed. I suspect it may be useful for a pure marketing type instead of an armchair sociologist like myself.</span>

                    <span>Michael J. Weiss documents the way populations have fractured into different demographic and lifestyle groups, or clusters. He gives these clusters catchy names that describe the key lifestyle features which influence their buying behavior, voting, and other choices. This excellent, original, well-researched book focuses on clusters in the U.S., though Canada and Europe are sometimes cited. The book is written in an easy-to-read style, but some may find it difficult to read because of the wealth of detail. Sometimes, it is hard to keep the various clusters straight, particularly in the first few chapters when Weiss refers to them without defining them. However, definition is difficult. These groups are composed of many characteristics, as becomes clear in the last chapter describing the United States' 62 clusters. We [...] recommend this book to those in management or marketing who are developing products, services, and programs for particular niche groups.<br></span>
