                    <span>The author seems to know what she is talking about in Rome which is the lagest part of the book. Her recommendations in Florence and Venice seem to be based mostly on hearsay.<BR>Consider this: The book is 274 pages long. The glossary of terms and bibliograpy account for 72 pages. The book does review trattorias but it also reviews expensive restaurants, pizzerias,<BR>gelaterias, wine bars , shops that sell wine and serve light lunches, and wine shops that offer tastings and canapes. There is a lot of detail im this book, but after reading it I decided it was of little practical use to me since I am an ordinary tourist looking for a good place to eat near the attractions I will be visiting on this my third trip to Rome (second to Florence and Venice). Many of the recommendations are clustered in neighborhoods that are somewhat removed. The book is not going on my trip with me... The purchase price was a waste of money.</span>

                    <span>Don't travel in Rome, Florence, or Venice without this book (unless you have a week's supply of PB&J in your pack, and are a masochist). Insight and intelligence mark the assessments of the restaurants, with the judgement of locals (Ms. Fant, herself, for Rome) as confirmation. If you choose your spots with this book, you will know exactly what you are getting, will make your travel funds go farther, and will make your palate happy.</span>

                    <span>"...I've looked through the window" was the first sentence I read when looking though the Florence section. I'm sorry, but looking through the window doesn't exactly qualify one to write a review of their food. I've looked through the windows of loads of restaurants I haven't eaten in - can I publish a book too? All in all this book was a disappointment, at least for the Florence section. I see from other reviews that she is more familiar with Rome, so perhaps this book would be worth buying for that instead. I recommend Sandra Gustafson's "Cheap Eats in Italy" instead. The title is misleading (although you can eat cheaply if you follow her advice on what to order) and is full of wonderful recommendations from simple tripe stalls to fancy restaurants.</span>

                    <span>Finding a good restaurant that is also a good value is<BR>perhaps more difficult in Venice than any other major Italian<BR>city. Over the years we have come to grief with Michelin and<BR>with Gambero Rosso more often in Venezia than anywhere else<BR>in Italy. It is thus with real delight that we can report a<BR>gastronomically flawless stay in La Serenissima, thanks to<BR>Maureen Fant's recent guide, which combines a wealth of practical<BR>dining advice with engaging gossip about one's hosts. If you<BR>feel you need a friend in Venice to dine there with confidence- look no further!</span>
