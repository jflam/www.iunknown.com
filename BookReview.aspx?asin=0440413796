                <span id="Label1">As millions of readers of Hatchet, The River, and Brian's Winter know, Brian Robeson survived alone in the wilderness by finding solutions to extraordinary challenges. But now that's he's back in civilization, he can't find a way to make sense of high school life. He feels disconnected, more isolated than he did alone in the North. The only answer is to return-to "go back in"-for only in the wilderness can Brian discover his true path in life, and where he belongs.<br></span>

                    <span>Brian's Return, by Gary Paulsen, is an adventure/survival book about Brian's long-awaited return to the Canadian woods written by Paulsen, a three time Newberry Honor award winner. The story begins with Brian, a 16 year old boy trying to live a normal life. The hard part for him is, he spent 48 days in the Canadian woods after his pilot had a heart attack and it changed his perspective on life. He can't find joy in having his food put right in front of him, or talking about who was going out with whom. After beating up a football player, he sees a counselor named Caleb. Caleb listens to his beautiful descriptions, and tells Brian that the answer was to go back up into the wilderness. He creates a list and a plan for a hundred mile kayak trip to eventually visit the Smallhorns, who rescued him in Brian's Winter. Brian goes through yet another action packed wilderness experience in Brian's Return. This book would be a little hard for young kids to find the true meaning of, so ages 11 and up would be a good reccomended age. Anyone who enjoyed Hatchet and its other sequels will enjoy this book.</span>

                    <span>Brian's Return is about a boy named Brian that in the past was stuck in the wilderness for a long time alone (if you didn't know that read Hatchet.) He diecides to go back after seeing an ex-cop, Caleb for counseling after an fight with a football jock. Before departing, he finds out the pilot can only take him so far and he'll have to canoe the rest of the way. Without telling his mom about this detail he starts preparing.<BR>I think it's a great book for learning how to survive in the wilderness, but it's a good book for someone without a care in the world also. I didn't like the fact that there wasn't many characters in the book. The beginning is kinda boring until you get into the second chapter, but hang on to it. After that it gets better and better until the end. I wish it wouldn't have let off as if Gary Paulsen had to make a deadline. I wish he would make a followup to tell us what's next. But don't take my word for it, read it.</span>

                    <span>The fight scene is informative as to how the atitude of having to kill for survival can bleed over into inapropriate areas. The List of equipment Brian takes back into the wild is usefull. How he describes both the beauty of the woods as well as his restlessness in the city is good. His differentness in what he cares about is also informative. <P>However, the book is essentialy a mysical journey. While Brian is Thankfull, I wonder to whom he is thankfull. What spirits guide him?</span>

                    <span>nonfiction<BR>Brian's Return <BR>Brian's Return is a disappointment! Gary Paulsen is a excellent author, but he could of done a better job for this book. This wasn't his best writhing. The beginning of this book was very boring, because he is in his home town telling how boring it is to be in town. Brian finally figures out that he likes the woods better and it makes him free. He wants to get permission to go back to the woods and live there. When he finally gets the permission the permission to go back, he has to find a why out there. An airline will drive when to 1 island and Brian's has to row his way to three other islands. He rows to one island a day and has to find his own food.<BR>The sequels to Brian's Return are Hatchet, The River, and Brian's Winter. Gary Paulson is the author of the best selling novel of the year "Brian Winter". This book is very adventurous at times. I thought it would like Hatchet ,but it wasn't even close. I think that's way I didn't like it.</span>
