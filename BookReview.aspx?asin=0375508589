                    <span>Shadow Divers gives a different perspective to Chowdhury's "The Last Dive".  This is also a must-read if you are a diver on the east coast.  The personal stories of the two overly dedicated men that gave everything for a WWII wreck makes for an unbelievable read.  Great book.</span>

                    <span>"Shadow Divers" is that rare work of non-fiction that reads with all the suspense and thrills of top-notch fiction.  It is truly a remarkable story, totally immersing the reader in a number of extraordinary topics, including the cloistered and eccentric lives of deep-wreck divers and the horrors of submarine warfare in World War II.  The mystery of why an undiscovered and unrecorded wreck of a Nazi sub lying 60 miles off the coast of New Jersey is more than enough substance for a good read. But Kurson embellishes this fascinating tale with a well-metered dose of human interest and intrigue appropriate for what is literally a life-and-death struggle to unlock the secret of this grave 200 feet below the surface of the Atlantic.  What truly sets Kurson's craft above the pack is in the respect and pathos with which he - and the divers - treat the fallen crewmembers.  Going simply beyond finding and identifying the wreck, Kurson chronicles the painstaking efforts divers Chatterton and Kohler take to identify the ill-fated crewmembers, and to set the historical record straight with both Navies and, more importantly, with the surviving families of the German sailors.  This is a tale that deserves to be told, and Kurson tells it with gusto and empathy.  Informative and entertaining, educational and intriguing, this is one book you don't want to miss.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best written, most absorbing books I've read in a very long time.  It's one of those rare books that really sucks you in.  I could hardly stay awake at work on a couple of days, because I had to read "just a couple of more pages" instead of getting to sleep the night before.  Fantastic writing, as well as an intriguing story.</span>

                    <span>Wherever there's a sunken shipwreck, you'll find a good fishing spot as well as the potential to recover something valuable.  Hence, fishermen and divers alike tend to keep such locations secret when possible.  Bill Nagle, having gained fame by recovering the bell from the Andria Doria, gets the coordinates to another deep-sea wreck, which he suspects could be a huge find.  Too sick from the effects of alcoholism, he gets together a group of expert divers to check it out, including John Chatterton.  Chatterton dives first to determine if it's worthwhile or not, and discovers a German U boat (submarine) from WWII right off the coast of New Jersey.  The true mystery becomes which submarine is it?  As he and fellow diver, Richie Kohler, become increasingly obsessed with discovering its name, several other divers lose their lives trying to help solve the mystery. 
<br />
<br />Kurson does an excellent job telling this true story of the two diver's obsession with the mystery U boat.  His attention to detail is terrific without becoming tedious, and he does especially well to explain the difficulties involved with such deep diving.  His descriptions of the effects of pressure leave no doubt and you almost feel as though you've been to the bottom of the sea with Chatterton and Kohler.  But he also richly introduces the reader to the characters and their backgrounds to where you almost feel you know them.  Their mystery quickly and easily becomes real, and I found it difficult to put the book down, reading compulsively until the mystery was solved, at which point appropriate background is given on the men who died aboard the "U-Who."
<br />
<br />A thoroughly exciting ride without lulls in the action on a level with Krakauer's "Into Thin Air" account of Mt. Everest.  I've also seen comparisons to "The Perfect Storm," but I found that story perfectly boring.  In contrast to that book, this is without made up dialog as those involved are still alive to tell their tale.  </span>
