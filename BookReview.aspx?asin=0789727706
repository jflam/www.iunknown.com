                    <span>I found this book to be alot more useful than another review I have read on it.<br>The book is a good reference book showing very clearly in illustrations and instructions what you have to do to achieve the feature you wish to use in Photoshop and is very good at doing so. The book also packs every feature that Photoshop has to offer.<br>This book would be well suited to a person that likes to learn by taking a digital image on their PC and following the well written instructions to achieve the desired effect you want to achieve for that photo.<br>HOWEVER, having said this, the book is not a textbook with exercises to practice your skills and is does not inspire you to get stuck into Photoshop and enjoy indulging in creativity.<br>In other words, as the title suggest it is a very good "How To Use" book (i'd give it 5/5 for that), but not great at teaching you how to be creative with Photoshop</span>

                    <span>This was my 1st Photoshop book purchase and I was excited...<p>I thought it would be better than it was but it wasn't. <br>It doesn't really tell you how to use the program very well. I found myself lookinjg for more information elsewhere after every example in here cuz it didn't help me other than to show me where the tool was located. <p>I think the manual is MUCH MORE helpful. This book definitely made me appreciate the manual much more. I wouldn't waste your money....there are much better books out there. I'm sorry I wasted mine.</span>
