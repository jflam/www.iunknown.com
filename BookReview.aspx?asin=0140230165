                    <span>I thoughrouly enjoyed and learned from the Toa of Pooh. The Te of Piglet seemed like little more than Mr Hoff's attempt to rub the success of the first book in the face of his critics.<p>The theoretical intention of the book was to explain the concept of Te and applying it to piglet for the western audiance. You could probably sum up everything he had to say about it on one page. Or one quote from the New Testament: "Blessed are the meek." He didn't really say much more than that on the subject.<p>What the book really seemed to be about was Eeyore. How Eeyore was against him, how Eeyore was wrong, how Eeyore never does anything, how Eeyore started all the wars... I often forgot the book was even supposed to be about piglet.<p>He devotes a lot of time, especially near the end to various political issues, such as the destruction of the redwood forest. A worthy cause, and some of his other's may also be worthy, but he doesn't make it clear at all what any of it has to do with Piglet. He probably should have written a different book entirely.<p>This book was less about Taoism and personal growth than it was a lesson in learning to ignore people who don't agree with you. And if you didn't know Benjamin Hoff Personally, and never told him the idea of the Toa of Pooh was stupid, then the core message wasn't meant for you. To those who is was meant for, allow me to paraphrase: I told you so.</span>

                    <span>While some of the history regarding Confucianism and Taoism was moderately interesting the book quickly decended into the author's own political agendas.  I'm only a third of the way into the book and I'm already considering selling it back to the nearest used bookstore.  Such a disappointment.  The Tao of Pooh was a much more interesting read.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the kind of book that appeals to deep thinkers. You know the sort, the folks who think that "innuendo" is a brand of Italian suppositories.<p>If you loved Hoff's anti-scientific ravings which you read under electrically powered lights in an air-conditioned room, then used your computer to post your sycophantic droolings to the internet and do *not* see the stunning inconsistency in your worldview/lifestyle, you will similarly fail to understand the following:<p>Hoff explains on p.191 how his MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR was ambushed by armed thugs and the MARTIAL ARTIST came out ahead *merely because he is small*.  His training had nothing to do with it.  We are meant to believe Mike Tyson doesn't fight Bantam-weights for *his* *own* *protection*.   <p>The Neo-luddite rant gets old, especially when coupled with Hoff's inability to reason.  Yes, I know "reason" is a bourgeois concept but it figures so prominently in the real world.  The only contributions of the West worth mentioning are velcro and telescopes.  The latter he uses to gaze longingly at a fictionally romanticized China.  The former he uses to replace shoelaces.  D@amnably pesky, oppressive, and over-complicated shoelaces! <p>If Hoff is an intellectually stimulating read for you, you need to seriously evaluate your reading list.</span>

                    <span>I read the Tao of Pooh and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was hoping I would find the same amount of enjoyment in the Te of Piglet if not more however I was destined for disappointment.<p>This book speaks very little about Taoism and more about his own personal social and political beliefs.  I was also offended by his complete disdain of the American Military.  I consider myself a Taoist and I am also a Soldier in the U.S. Army.<p>Everyone sees the Tao in differant ways and reading through it I see conflict a natural part of the Way.  Dog fight dog, cat fights cat, apes murder one another.  Conflict is just as natural as a tree growing in a forest.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In a nutshell, take all the wonder and whimsy and philosophical depth of the Tao of Pooh. Repeat precisely the same messages in shorter form, swapping the name Piglet for Pooh. Mix in with cynicism, complaints, whining, and just a very slight edge of borderline paranoia. Serve cold (and mirthless, and dull, etc.). This book, more than anything, seems a documentary on Benjamin Hoff's slide from philosophizing tranquilly to becoming a very bitter person. From scarcely veiled ravings against feminism (something that seems to smack of a man who recently suffered a bad breakup over macho behaviour) to railings against modern technology that harken back vaguely to the tinfoil hat crowd, this book is best appreciated as a cautionary tale that even the most seemingly solid minds can be spoiled by a life not lived carefully. The text itself, as informed above, is basically the Tao of Pooh rehashed with this depressing, trite, and minimalistic elegy for the lost innocence of Piglet, made into little more than a handpuppet for Hoff's personal agendas.</span>
