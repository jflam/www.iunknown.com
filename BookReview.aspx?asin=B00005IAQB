                    <span>My wife and I saw this IMAX movie back in 1998 when it debuted on the IMAX screens. You lose a bit of the impact seeing it just on a TV, although I get the feeling that it will look pretty awesome on an HDTV.<P>Anyway, the IMAX film follows an elephant clan through one season, having to weather drought, etc. There's a heartbreaking scene where the clan comes across another female elephant whose calf has died.<P>But the real reason to get this DVD is for the "Making of" documentary. This is fascinating! It's chock full of details about IMAX, like the fact that one single frame of an IMAX film is the equivalent of two 70 mm frames put together; it's got about **ten** times the level of detail that a 35 mm frame has. Not only that, the documentary shows how they got the elephants used to their presence so that they could film them. It explains how the sound that you hear isn't actually contemporaneous with the picture, because the IMAX camera is so loud it would drown out a lot of ambient sound.</span>

                    <span>Beautiful photography. A charming look into the lives of these African leviathans. A disc the whole family will enjoy.</span>

                    <span>The documentary isn't the only great thing on this DVD... you should see the "Making off"... Great images (I don't think someone will ever get on film an elephant charging as the one on this documentary - I saw this film in a theatre in Cape Town and I'm still holding my breath). The story is Ok...<BR>If you love elephants or Africa... this is a must have !!!!!</span>

                    <span>but it really depends on the level of interest you have in elephants. Even though the photography is good; my interest in elephant's seem to have peak with this film. After a second viewing I was a little bored. I think a better balance Imax film is Africa: The Serengeti which has some spectacular photography and moves at a faster pace. This film conentrates on elephants and if you have a big interest in this subject you should be happy. There are some nice shots and one sequence were they use time lapse photography of a thunder storm was a highlight. But that sequence lasted for just 30 seconds. To be fair my interest in elephants is limited. My interest in Imax films is high. For me this film is a good rental but not one to buy.</span>
