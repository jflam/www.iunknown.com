                <span id="Label1">What Explains the Recent Tremendous Growth in Private Equity Funds? How Have These Funds Created so Much Value? Can We Expect This Kind of Growth in Other Countries and Other Types of Investments? The pool of U.S. private equity funds has grown from $5 billion in 1980 to over $175 billion in 1999. Private equity's recent growth has outstripped that of almost every class of financial product. Whether you are an entrepreneur seeking private equity finance, a private equity investor grappling with the industry's changes, or an investor interested in private equity as a potential investment, this book is required reading! It presents a collection of real world cases-supplemented by detailed industry notes-that explore the exciting and dynamic world of venture capital and buyout funds. The organization mirrors that of the venture capital/private equity process itself:<br>   * The first part explores the raising and structuring of private equity funds, as well as the perspective of investors.<br>   * The second part explores the selection,oversight, and adding value to firms-the 'heart' of the private equity cycle.<br>   * The third part describes how private equity groups reap attractive returns from successful investments.<br>   * The final section explores the emerging efforts to translate the private equity model into other settings, such as corporate venturing programs.</span>

                    <span>A must for anyone wanting to know how VC firms work, structure themselves, and considerations for funding. This is an excellent case study that ought to be in a graduate program! It's as close as you'll get without working for a VC firm. I would suggest reading "The Venture Capital Cycle" first to get a general feel for VC and how it works. Then read the case study!</span>

                    <span>Over the past few years the institutional private equity market has exploded. Riding on the backs phenomenal public markets and a wave of technological innovation, private equity in general and venture capital has become one of the most sought after investments.<P>However, given the rash of recent publicity, stellar performance, and a balooning assets, there's surprisingly little research available about the institutional private equity market. Profs. Lerner and Gompers currently account for probably half of all academic research in this market.<P>The institutional private equity market is quite different from angel investments. The majority of the capital at the institutional level flows from large investment institutions like public pensions, endowments and insurance companies. Moreover, the personal investing into private companies do so professionally.<P>More than anything, the book serves as a primer to the institutional private equity market.<P>The book was intitially meant for HBS and other MBA students. Thus, almost all the content is in case study form. In a lot of respects this is advantageous. In general, a book either has the option of being a primer or providing high level analysis on a very specific topic. Clearly this book is the former. In my opinion, the downfall of most primers are the oversimplification of topics and useless generalizations. Given the early stages of the institutional private equity market, generalizations are especially questionable and difficult. On the other hand, the case method presents users with numerous situations and predicaments facing the participants. As a result, readers gain an understanding of the issues facing this market from a number of perspectives.<P>This books provides useful information on key topics such as investing and analyzing private equity funds from an institution's perspective, fund of funds, forming a private equity fund, and the direct investments into companies by the private equity funds, along with many other topics. Whatever level the private equity professional is functioning, understanding each of these components I imagine is key.<P>This casebook provides an very good overview of the institutional private equity market. Likewise, to the best of my knowledge, this is the only book covering this topic.</span>
