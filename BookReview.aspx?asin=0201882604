                <span id="Label1">C# was developed from the ground up to serve as the main language for Microsoft's new .NET framework--and to compete with Java. <b>C# Web Development for ASP.NET: Visual QuickStart Guide</b> is aimed at beginning developers who may have experience with scripting languages but are not necessarily experienced with object-oriented languages. Using task-based examples and hundreds of screenshots, all code examples are presented in the context of ASP.NET development, aimed at Web developers. While <b>C# Web Development for ASP.NET: Visual QuickStart Guide</b> does not attempt to teach everything about the .NET Framework, it clearly explains all you need to know to get up and running with the C# language.</span>

                    <span>Although I usually enjoy this series of books I didn't like this one and quickly returned it. It is definitely not for beginners and seems to be all over the place without any particular logical flow. It doesn't appear to be well thought out and really has very little ASP.NET inside it. The author mentions this is a book to teach the C# language and the choices to bring the lesson across were command line, windows or web programs. The author chose web (ASP.NET) yet doesn't teach much at all about ASP.NET. If you want to learn C# this book is not horrible but there are many others much better that this. If you wan't to learn ASP.NET using C# do yourself a favor and buy Programming ASP.NET by Oreilly.</span>

                    <span>I like this book despite the fact it can be hard to follow. Good solid examples that take you from beginnging to end and cover all the necessary C# functionality. This book is good to have around and should be looked at by all who are starting to use C# and ASP.NET.</span>

                    <span>This book is designed for the developer with little to no OO experience, who wants to write ASP.NET quickly in C#. I found this to be a great book which fulfills its purpose. The book provides a short section on a specific topic (e.g. "Representing Objects as Strings") and after a little theory, provides the specific steps to perform the task. Sometimes these steps are elements of code the reader needs to type, other times instructions are provided for the Visual Studio .NET IDE. Code examples are provided throughout the book, with relevant lines or snippets highlighted in red. This formatting allows the reader to easily see the author's point.<P>After reading this book, the reader should be familiar with Microsoft's .NET initiative as well as have an understanding of the C# syntax. Additionally, the reader should have a good understanding of OO programming after reading this book. Furthermore, through reading this book, the reader will learn the basics of inheritance, interfaces, delegates and event handling, error handling, reflection, as well as web services.<P>If you're an experienced Java or C++ developer, you may want to find a more advanced book. However, if you are new to OO programming or .NET, then you should definitely pick up this book.</span>
