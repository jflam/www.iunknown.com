                    <span>At the time of this review, the latest version of Snort is 2.3. However, the newest books(about two out there) on Snort, including this one, only covers up to version 2.1. And according to the Product Description, "in this community, major upgrades are noted by .x and not by full number upgrades as in 2.0 to 3.0". This pretty much means that this book is already out-dated, and it's printed in 2004, less than a year ago. This reminds me of when Linux was starting to get popular. Red Hat Linux went from version 6.2 to version 9.0 in just two years. Not to mention there are tons of books supposely dedicated to all those versions of Linux in the short two year period. Linux saved businesses a lot of money, and provided stability that MS Windows counterpart didn't. Snort will eventually replace or be at the same level as the current commercial Intrusion Detection Systems(IDS).
<br />I think this time the publishers are smarter, and recognized the pattern from their Linux frenzy publishing experience, lol. The old Linux books litter the thousands of bookstore shelves with nobody buying, lol. That's why at the moment there are very few books on Snort.</span>

                    <span>If you want to know about Snort 2.1, one of the best open source intrusion detections systems available, then "Snort 2.1 Intrusion Detection, Second Edition" is the book you will want to have.  This is an extensive examination of the Snort program and includes Snort 2.1 on CD with the Book.  <p>The authors start with defining what an intrusion detection system is, what it is not, and how placing it in your network at different points achieves different goals.  This is followed by an introduction to Snort and a description of its capabilities and functions before getting into the nuts and bolts of installing and configuring it.<p>One of the more difficult parts of Snort to understand is how to write the rules that determine when an intrusion has occurred.  The authors do an excellent job of describing exactly how to write good rules to achieve the results you want.  They even include an excellent section on how to deal with all that information you will be collecting.  <p>"Snort 2.1 Intrusion Detection, Second Edition" is highly recommended for anyone who wants a good, useful explanation of how an intrusion detection system should work and how to implement Snort to achieve that result.</span>

                    <span>Syngress published "Snort 2.0" in Mar 03, and I gave it a four star review in Jul 03.  Excerpts from that review appear on the back cover and first page of "Snort 2.1," published only 14 months later.  I still think "Snort 2.1" is overall the best Snort book available, but I was disappointed by signs of rushed production and lack of coverage of key Snort features.<p>The table of contents for "Snort 2.1" is deceiving, as it is almost exactly the same as "Snort 2.0."  However, the new book is almost 200 pages larger than its predecessor, with many internal modifications.  Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12 and 13 are either completely new or substantially new.  Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 are either partial rewrites or have some material added or dropped.  Despite all of this work, "Snort 2.1" fails to spend time on key subjects, which I will mention during a chapter-by-chapter examination of the book.<p>First, I recommend skipping ch 1.  Aside from some general IDS advice, it is haphazard and contributes nothing to the core Snort discussion.  Ch 2 is a quick overview of Snort capabilities, and should have been the lead chapter.  Ch 3 describes Snort installation, but suffers apparently swapped figures (3.1 and 3.2) and a wrong figure (3.5).  Ch 3 is still a nice upgrade from its counterpart in "Snort 2.0," which gave hints for deploying Snort on Red Hat Linux 8.0.  The new ch 3 covers Linux, OpenBSD, and Windows.  <p>Ch 4, "Inner Workings," is one of the reasons "Snort 2.1" has an advantage over the competition.  It's tough to go wrong when Snort's developers describe the tool's operation.  Still, signs of rough editing appear on p. 170 and 191, and the "-a cmg" switch should be "-A cmg".  <p>Ch 5 covers rules, and is a big disappointment.  For most users, rules are the primary means to customize Snort.  Like "Snort 2.0," ch 5 fails to help readers with some of the more important new Snort rule options, like byte_test, byte_jump, distance, and within (available since 2.0.rc1 in Mar 03).  Ch 5 implies on p. 145 that running Snort with -v is a good idea, despite every other recommendation in the book that verbose mode is a performance killer.  Also, the IP "sec" option mentioned on p. 205 is not "IPSec" -- see RFC 791.  Overall, ch 5 spends too much time restating rule information found in Snort's manual, and not enough time on features available even in Snort 2.0.<p>Ch 6's discussion of preprocessors is a solid chapter, with new material on Snort's flow module, http_inspect, and perfmonitor.  The telnet preprocessor section is one of the better examples of a "code walkthrough," where the author shows code while explaining what it does.<p>Ch 7 is really showing its age.  "Snort 2.0" was behind the times when it said "Unified logs are the future of Snort reporting," and "Snort 2.1" makes the same mistake.  Barnyard, a means to read unified logs, was available in Sep 01!  Ch 7 also misses the boat on XML output, calling it "our favorite and relatively new logging format" on p. 322.  The XML plug-in spo_xml wasn't even part of snort-2.0.0, never mind snort-2.1.0.  Basic research would have revealed Joe McAlerney's announcement of Silicon Defense's snort-idmef XML plug-in in Jun 01, followed by Sandro Poppi's assumption of the project in Aug 03.  A mention of Barnyard's "XML formatting capabilities" appears in ch 7 on p. 322, yet Barnyard does not offer this natively.<p>I was happy to see Sguil addressed in ch 8, but sad to see Sguil's use of session and full content data not appreciated for its true worth.  Ch 9 does a good job describing Oinkmaster and gives sound advice on avoiding the "not any" rule negation problem.  Ch 10 covers really old testing tools like Sneeze, whose stateless operation cannot fool stream4's stateful inspection.<p>Ch 11, explaining Barnyard, is clearly the book's shining moment. This is the reason I read "Snort 2.1": Barnyard's author, Andrew Baker, describes Barnyard's history, the format of unified logs, and how best to use his contribution to Snort.  Bravo.  Ch 12 was also very good, using case studies to compare three different "active response" choices.  Ch 13 was new but not exceptionally helpful.<p>I would enjoy seeing three improvements in the third edition.  First, thoroughly scrub the book for old information.  Watch out for people writing about "Cerebus" or http_decode or offerings from Silicon Defense, whose Web site disappeared in early 2004.  Second, tell people to read the excellent Snort manual before reading the book.  There's no need to address topics well-covered in the manual, like all of the IP- and TCP-based rule options.  Third, ditch the existing rules chapter in favor of two new ones, one explaining principles via existing rules, and one showing advanced rule development.  <p>I still recommend buying this book, but you might guide your reading choices by the comments in this review.</span>
