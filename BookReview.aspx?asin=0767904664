                <span id="Label1">From his perspective as a journalist and a true fan, Bob Costas, NBC's award-winning broadcaster, shares his unflinching views on the forces that are diminishing the appeal of major league baseball and proposes realistic changes that can be made to protect and promote the game's best interests.<br><br>In this cogent--and provocative--book, Costas examines the growing financial disparities that have resulted in nearly two-thirds of the teams in major league baseball having virtually <i>no</i> chance of contending for the World Series.  He argues that those who run baseball have missed the crucial difference between mere change and real progress. And he presents a withering critique of the positions of both the owners and players while providing insights on the wild-card system, the designated-hitter rule, and interleague play.  Costas answers each problem he cites with an often innovative, always achievable strategy for restoring genuine competition and rescuing fans from the forces that have diluted the sheer joy of the game.<br><br>Balanced by Costas's unbridled appreciation for what he calls the "moments of authenticity" that can still make baseball inspiring, Fair Ball offers a vision of our national pastime as it can be, a game that retains its traditional appeal while initiating thoughtful changes that will allow it to thrive into the next century.<br></span>

                    <span>Costas' book is far from perfect, however his ultimate conclusions (though not original) make sense.  And he is right.  As we see a .267 hitter like Carlos Beltran make over $100 million (okay, maybe he is much better than that) and a medicore pitcher like Kris Benson make $7 million a year (not mention Jaret Wright's contract) in 2004 (oh and Russ Ortiz for $32 million?), Costas' ideas ring even truer.  Some of the arguments are dated--esp. his section on the wild card.  He was right about the unbalanced sked. which has come into being.  The major flaw in the book is that Costas simply repeats himself too much.  We get it Bob--a salary cap is good.  So is revenue sharing.  Etc....this is a big criticism when a book is under 200 pages.  The last work stoppage was avoided and that was good.  Costas was again right in blaming the players who look worse today than ever (although owners are still not so great)--esp. in light of steroid issues.  Baseball is moving toward a salary cap (Bud wants one)...So, overall Costas case is compelling.  The one other issue I have is with Costas condemning "traditionalists."  He claims not to be one and then spends 20 pages or so decrying the wild card and "destruction" of the pennant race.  That is a bit much.  And sounds like a traditionalist to me.  He slams people who love the poetic, transcendent, and Kinsellaian (I made up a term) nature of the game.  Considering the steroid scandal, for example, I'll take W.P. Kinsella anyday.  Overall, though, I give Costas 4 stars and it was cool to see him stand up for the fans.  </span>

                    <span>The problem with a book that attempts to speak to the current problems of any situation is that by the time the publishers feed its pages through the press, the facts have changed. After such a book collects a few years of dust on the library shelves, it can almost be obsolete. For instance, in "Fair Ball", Bob Costas discusses the Yankees out-of-control 80 million dollar payroll (try 200+ million) and considers the possibility that Seattle will have to eventually trade Griffey and/or A-Rod (I do hope they can keep them). So, be prepared to have a few anachronistic arguments to today's state of baseball. 
<br />
<br />Even if some of his examples are now out of date, Costas's logic is solid. He makes clear arguments as to why expansion (more teams and divisions), the wildcard, the Yankees' checkbook and inter-league play are all destroying the game. Being a big fan of baseball and someone who considers himself to be up-to-date on all the angles on the hot issues of the game, Costas humbled me with theories and facts that until now were foreign to this reviewer. Anyone who wants to engage in an educated debate on the financial state of baseball or the possibility of adding more teams or more tiers of playoffs should consider this required reading.

                    <span>Bob Costas has framed the problems with "America's Game" very well in this book as he details the 'whys' of his proposed solutions.  In my opionion (a true baseball loyalist who doesn't really care for the sell-out tactics of the Bud Selig administration), Costas outlines a good plan for returning baseball to the way it ought to be.  The four-hour baseball game (in which about an hour is commercials), games beginning at 8pm or later on the east coast, the juiced up baseball, the wild card, etc., etc., are all bringing down the game and making it unattractive to fans.  I wish MLB would take the Costas Plan to heart and fix what they are breaking.</span>

                    <span>Bob Costas gives a clear and concise analysis of the state of major league baseball today and how it was just 15 years ago.  Bob is not afraid to tell it like it is, and explains concrete reasons (not just "being a tradionalist") why gimmicks such as new ballparks, interleague play, wildcard play, etc., and why crippling events such as owners who know no limits to their spending or players who know no limits to their greed are destroying the grand old game.<p>But it's not a book of complaining.  Oh, no.  Bob gives a very comprehensive plan of how to fix many of these failures.  There is one problem with most of his solutions -- they make sense.  With today's wishy washy commissioner, with one or two owners having their own way no matter what, and with players who follow any ridiculous notion that their ill advised union throws out, ideas this well thought out will be immediately dismissed.  Why fix team salary inequities when you can put Spider-man on the bases?  Why control players' salaries when you can pump your players up with illegal steriods and then move the fences 25 feet closer to the plate?  No, Bob's ideas will not be accepted in today's baseball family because they are not gimmicks.<p>Let's hope that when Selig steps down (or falls down), Costas is considered for his job.  I actually think that Bob could push through some of these ideas.</span>

                    <span>There isn't a book's worth of material here, that's for sure. This could easily have been boiled down to a lengthy magazine piece for Sports Illustrated. And his prose is merely serviceable - far short of George Will's eloquent standard.<p>I'm not familiar enough with the background of this debate to say whether his ideas are "original" or not. But they're certainly plausible enough to warrant examination. My only real beef with them is philosophical in nature, I suppose. He repeatedly insists that the few superstar players asked to sacrifice under his salary cap proposal could easily afford the loss.<p>First of all: they wouldn't be "asked" anything. They would be legally prohibited from earning their full market worth. Say it's "for the good of the game" if you like, but that seems like one slippery damned slope to me. Second: I don't know if that's a judgment you're entitled to make, Bob. I'm sure you're making plenty of scratch these days too. Feel free to donate as much of your salary to the Expos - in the name of "competitive balance" - as you like. But taking money out of someone's pocket - even Alex Rodriguez's pocket - without their consent is usually called theft.</span>
