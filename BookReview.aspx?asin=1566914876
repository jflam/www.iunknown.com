                    <span>California Hiking by Tom Steinstra and Ann Marie Brown has become something of a Bible to hikers over the years. This edition has some dramatic changes in format from previous versions of the book. Most obviously, the chapters cover much larger sections of the state. Whereas earlier editions used a narrow (and quite artificial grid) to place hikes, the 2003 guide divides the state into 16 chapters, each covering a broad geographical area of the state: from the Northern Redwoods to the Southern Deserts, and everything in between. Other changes include a longer introduction, with hiker safety tips, and the absence of Steinstra's amusing commentary on the Pacific Crest Trail. The latter was too general to be used by through hikers in any event. Finally a few trails were added or deleted.<P> On the whole, the new edition is an improvement over the last version. Placing hikes in a broad geographical area allows for easier planning of vacations. Still, with any guide this comprehensive, there are bound to be some problems: obviously the authors could not walk every trail listed every couple of years. Generally speaking, Tom Steinstra tends to underestimate miles. Local guides I've read and trails I've hiked tend to suggest more than his descriptions denote. Also, Steinstra requires more effort to give a hike a high difficulty rating than Brown does. <P> Ultimately, this book should not be relied upon for detailed information. Things like trail maps and detailed trail descriptions simply have no room in guide this comprehensive. The book is already a bit too bulky. Nonetheless, this book does give one a nice overview of various sections of the state. It is particularly helpful for travel. It can give someone a brief listing of hikes in an area and suggest a productive use of vacation times. People who do a lot of hiking in one particular area, however, would do well to purchase detailed guides that concentrate on a much smaller region. Living in the San Bernardino Mountains, I found little of use in this book. But it was invaluable on my recent trip to Humbolt Redwoods and vicinity. If you travel the state and like to hike, this book is<BR>well worth the price.</span>

                    <span>Well, my copy is a little dog-eared by now. Every spring I pick it up, and look for my next CA adventure. I look for secluded places, with senic beauty - this book has not let me down. Favorite of mine was the Summit Trail hike in South Warner Wilderness. "Savor every moment of this trip--it is one of the greatest little-known hiking trips anywhere in America." Who would have ever thought of going there if it weren't for this book. The 45-mile, 4-day hike was rated 4 (of 5) for difficulty, and 10 (of 10) for scenic beauty, and I found it to be exactly that. Keep in mind, that the difficulty factor can be adjusted by stretching the hike over more (or less) days, or by throwing in a layover day. Usually, when I pick this book up, I'm looking for a place to backpack for several days - the book is somewhat limited in this area, as approximately 2/3 of the book seems to be about day hikes - this is, of course, a plus for day hikers! The book is comprehensive - if you live in California, it will no doubt include hikes near your home.</span>

                    <span>My wife and I have really gotten our money's worth out of this book over the past few summmers. Perfect for those who love hiking, but need somewhere to go. It's full of great day hikes and a few decent packpacking trips as well. My only complaint is that I'd really like to see a lot more of the 20 mile weekend backpacking trips added to the book. Regardless, it's well worth picking up.</span>

                    <span>This book is an almost perfect guide to hiking in Northern California. It's UNBELIEVABLY thorough. My only two quibbles are: 1. Directions to trailheads are a little iffy in places, and (perhaps more importantly) 2. The difficulty ratings are sometimes waaay off. The book uses a 1 (easiest) through 5 (most difficult) difficulty rating. And yesterday, my husband and I went on a hike in the east bay area that the book deemed a 1 in difficulty, and it was considerably more difficult than many 3s we've hiked in the past. What's up with that?! If an inexperienced hiker showed up in tennis shoes relying on that 1 rating, that person could potentially be in physical danger in places.<P>Having said all that, we've used this book for nearly 3 years and have found it completely spot-on when it comes to identifying beautiful hikes. It's been particularly useful when we've been vacationing in a part of the state with which we're not very familiar. I recommend using this book as a way to identify awesome hikes you want to try, but then you should contact the state/national/whatever park you're about to visit and get more detailed information about the hike before embarking on it.</span>
