                <span id="Label1"><div><b><i>Includes 32 color photos taken by the author during the month he was embedded with the 82nd in Kuwait and Iraq.</i></b><br><br>This is a riveting account of the war in Iraq moving north with the 82nd Airborne. Units of the 82nd depart Kuwait and convoy to Iraq's Tallil Air Base en route to night-and-day battles within the major city of Samawah and its intact bridges across the Euphrates. Boots on the Ground quickly becomes an action-filled microcosm of the new kinds of ultramodern war fighting showcased in the overall battle for Iraq. At the same time it remains specific to the daily travails of the soldiers. Karl Zinsmeister, a frontline reporter who traveled with the 82nd, vividly conveys the careful planning and technical wizardry that go into today's warfare, even local firefights, and he brings to life the constant air-ground interactions that are the great innovation of modern precision combat.<br>    <br>What exactly does it feel like to travel with a spirited body of fighting men? To come under fire? To cope with the battlefield stresses of sleep-deprivation, and a steady diet of field rations for weeks on end? Readers of this day-to-day diary are left with not only a flashing sequence of strong mental images, but also a notion of the sounds and smells and physical sensations that make modern military action unforgettable. <br>    <br>Ultimately, <i>Boots on the Ground</i> is a human story: a moving portrayal of the powerful bonds of affection, trust, fear, and dedication that bind real soldiers involved in battle. There are unexpected elements: The humor that bubbles up amidst dangerous fighting. The pathos of a badly wounded young boy. The affection openly exhibited by many American soldiers--love of country, love of family and hometown, love of each other. This is a true-life tale of superbly trained men in extraordinary circumstances, packed with concrete detail, often surpassing fiction for sheer drama.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I suspect this book will have a classic appeal for many years among any Americans interested in knowing just what it is like to be under fire in combat. It is an exciting, dramatic, and vivid picture of a soldier's life. <P>But I am especially impressed how timely and relevant it is right now. The Iraq War has turned out to be the biggest issue in American public life in 2004, including in our Presidential election, and this book has some fascinating, and very fresh, things to say about the war, how it has been prosecuted, where it is heading, how the Iraqis are reacting, and so forth.<P>The main appeal of this book, however, is its human story. This is not a history or textbook. It is storytelling about human beings under ferocious pressure, and the wonderful, horrible, amazing, heartbreaking, brave, funny ways they react. I found it very memorable.</span>

                    <span>In his book "Boots on the Ground" the author chronicles his journey from the time he was informed that we would be an imbedded reporter, through thirty days of the campaign, to his eventual homecoming. During this journey Zinsmeister details a lot of the sights and sounds of a combat unit in action, but more importantly when they are off the line. In this respect this book gives the reader a genuine feel for what goes on in a combat unit.<P>Finally, he give a cogent aregument that the reporting of the news from Iraq was biased and self-serving by a number of embedded journalist, and by a few who feld they did not need to be close to the action to render their "expert" opinion. This section only reinforces what Bernie Goldberg wrote in "Biased".<P>In all, this was a well written book that deseves attention by the public at large as it represents the first rough draft of history. <P>If the book has any shortcomings it would be in the area of its length. I assume the the author had considerably more material than he used; I would have preferred he used it as the subject warrents expanded coverage.</span>

                    <span>This was highly recommended to me by some pilots and soldiers I know who actually served in Iraq, so I decided to try it. <P>Now I see why they like it. A dynamic read. Rich in information. Tremendously interesting and inspiring. And, they tell me, accurate.<P>So now I'm passing on the recommendation to others. I'll also be giving this book as a gift. Especially to people who think Americans have become nothing but self-absorbed couch potatoes, wimps, etc. <P>Meet some bold and brave souls.</span>

                    <span>The author works very hard at giving the reader a feel for the action, an "I was there" impression of actual combat and what was going on in his book. Unfortunately, I don't think his prose is much better than mine in too many cases. :( I sometimes that the feeling he had some auto style or theasaurus turned on to phrase his ideas. Quite frankly I think he is in desperate need of an editor if this is to go to a 2nd edition. I was also a bit turned off by some of his conservative ranting, but the liberals turn me off with their ranting too. I think he also maybe rushed this book a bit too quickly and needed a peer review. There were some factual errors regarding the 1991 Gulf War, usually numerical in nature, although these might be linked to a conservative viewpoint. Example: I believe he used a 100+ casualty figure for that bunker that had the civilians in it and was hit by mistake in 1991. I believe the correct total is more like 400+. He also gets off on a rant about the treasures looted from the museum that doesn't seem to jibe with the actual quotations of the director, etc. extensively quoted elsewhere. I think he does take a correct view of the library and some of the other damage (from fires and such). On the whole I'd call this average, although the "color," i.e., "I was there," might make it worth while. I think there are some better choices.</span>

                    <span>If your looking for a high-level review of the strategy or tactics of the Iraq War -- look elsewhere. This is not the "General's War" (an excellent book on the 1st Gulf War but told exclusively from the highest levels). If you're interested in a gripping tale of how individual soldiers fought the war and their day-to-day experiences (at least for the 1st month of the war)... this is definitely your book. Excellent reporting by Zinsmeister. I literally finished the book cover-to-cover in a single day. You'll clearly get an appreciation for the sacrifice, hardships, and professionalism of the soldiers who are defending our freedoms!</span>
