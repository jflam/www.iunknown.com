                <span id="Label1">Want to run faster, jump higher, play better? For years we've been told that we can achieve these grandiose goals with the help of high-performance athletic footwear. What used to be the lowly gym shoe has risen to a revered wardrobe staple. <i>The Sneaker Book: An Anatomy of the Industry and an Icon</i>, by journalist Tom Vanderbilt, relates the story of the sneaker in a breezy and fact-filled manner that perfectly captures the heart of the subject. Starting with a brief history of both the footwear and the $11 billion industry that now feeds off of it, Vanderbilt looks at the design, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and advertising that have taken the sneaker business to astronomical heights. His evaluation is augmented with a variety of charts, corporate profiles, previously published articles, and even cartoons that lend depth and shading to the topic. This informative and compact book reads like a special magazine issue devoted to a single subject, and it is indeed the first in a new series of similar books that will each focus on a popular consumer product. <I>--Howard Rothman</I> </span>

                    <span>"The Sneaker Book:  Anatomy of an Industry and An Icon" is well-written and excellently researched.  The badly-placed black-and-white sneaker photos and its academic tone, however, offer the book as an informative but slightly boring term paper on the sneaker industry.  Casual readers will probably (and rightly) want more color and certainly more sneaker photographs, but these flaws do not seriously hamper the book.</span>

                    <span>On the whole, I liked this informative book. Mr. Vanderbilt does an admirable job of giving us an insider's perspective on the athletic footwear industry and how it has insinuated itself into popular culture. I  also enjoyed the stories and comments in the sidebars which bolster his  perspective.<p>That said, the major thing that mars this book was the  decision to place the photos of the sneakers along the spine. In terms of  design, it was a poor decision, and it detracts from the text instead of  enhancing it. I found myself flattening the book out as much as I could so  I could see the photos, but even with that, the whole illustrative purpose  of the photos was lost. If this book is ever updated, I suggest that the  photos be placed somewhere that the reader can see them in their entirety.</span>
