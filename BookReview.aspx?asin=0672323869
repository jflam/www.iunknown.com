                    <span>Over the last 18 months I had read 7 or 8 VB.net and .net books, with two supposidly focused only on .net database and ADO.net.  While they gave me an understanding of the purpose of ADO.net's architecture, and one brought me thru the wizzards (for which a seperate book was hardly necessary).  Neither of these books left me with an understanding of what was really going on, or how I could actually develop ADO.net applications without wizzards. <p>ADO.net in 21 days was the answer to really understanding the details of how the dataset works inside, how the dataset and all ADO.net relates to XML, Adapter details, and much much more.<p>I give 5 stars to the book, yet subtract 1 since the samples all require SQL server, I would have appreciated having the samples in Access as well.  <p>I consider myself an intermediate VB programmer. I have worked in my spare time for close to a year, developing a database intensive, moderately complex VB.net application as a volunteer.  My agenda is to build a useful product for an organization while keeping my skills up to date -- I have been programming in a variety of languages since 1966.  I was especially interested in using ADO.net to make sure what I develop now will have the longest life possible.</span>
