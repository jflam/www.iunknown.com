                <span id="Label1">"In retrospect," writes David Halberstam, "the pace of the fifties seemed slower, almost languid. Social ferment, however, was beginning just beneath this placid surface." He shows how the United States began to emerge from the long shadow of FDR's 12-year presidency, with the military-industrial complex and the Beat movement simultaneously growing strong. Television brought not only situation comedies but controversial congressional hearings into millions of living rooms. While Alfred Kinsey was studying people's sex lives, Gregory Pincus and other researchers began work on a pill that would forever alter the course of American reproductive practices. Halberstam takes on these social upheavals and more, charting a course that is as easy to navigate as it is wide-ranging.</span>

                    <span>Author David Halberstam takes an in-depth look at the USA during the supposedly tranquil 1950's, when the economy boomed, crime was low, suburbs expanded, and the nation feared Communism.     
<br />
<br />Readers should enjoy how this engaging narrative covers a gamut from foreign policy, to politics, social issues and rock-n- roll.  We see the nightmare of the Korean War and McCarthyism up close, while learning how the growth of television changed the nation politically and socially.   We see how companies like McDonald's evolved in an increasingly car-oriented, suburban culture. The author also examines the early civil rights movement, and the great migration of blacks from rural south to urban north (where their problems often continued).  
<br />
<br />Many look back at the 1950's as a time of serenity, but the author shows that the bygone decade had stresses and a turbulent undercurrent that came to a head a decade later.  Readers can almost pick chapters at random and learn as much as reading straight through.  
<br />
<br />Halberstam has done an excellent job.  This is a superbly readable look at a compelling time.

                    <span>Read THE SUMMER OF 49 if you want to see Halberstam at his best, writing about a world he loves, and understands. But don't waste your time with this book. When it comes to the fifties, rock and roll, and the king of rock and roll -- that would be Elvis Presley, baby -- Halberstam knows less than nothing. 
<br />
<br />Everything he says about Elvis is either an oft-repeated cliche or else faint-praise condescension. Generationally, Halberstam is hopelessly out of touch, and in way over his head. In SUMMER OF 49 Halberstam swoons over Joe Dimaggio like a pubescent bobby-soxer, but somehow Elvis does not make the grade. Why? Elvis changed the world in ways Joe Dimaggio never dreamed. Elvis was "narcissistic" we are told -- he could "only dance by himself." Now, if there was ever a narcissist, it was surely Joe Dimaggio, who worshiped all his life at the altar of his own perfection. How do I know this?
<br />
<br />I read SUMMER OF 49.</span>

                    <span>If you want to understand the upheavals of the 1960's then don't miss this superbly written look at the 1950's by David Halberstam.  From the beginnings of the "liberal consensus," the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement, and through the Eisenhower Administration the seeds of upheaval were all sown during the decade we mostly remember as slow, innocent, and eventless.  Halberstam has done an excellent job of showing us how skewed our memories can be. I was especially taken in by the onset of Madison Avenue's  packaging of presidential candidates beginning in 1952, and also the look at the manipulation employed by Richard Nixon in his famous "Checkers" speech (seems like he got the idea from "Queen for a Day") and his use of his wife Pat for that purpose.  </span>

                    <span>Recommend this one even if you are not interested in this time period.  If is full of wonderful tidbits and gives us some very good answers as to how we got were we are today.  Having lived through this period of time, I guess, like many, I thought I knew quite a lot.  I did'nt.  Picked up some very good stuff here.  The work is well reasearched and presented in a very readable form.  Highly recommend!</span>

                    <span>I received this hefty text several years ago as a gift.  Let me say, it was truly that.<p>This book really brings the roots and context of the era in which we live into sharp focus.  From the genesis of the television culture to the real beginnings of the sexual revolution, the book is matched in its breadth only by its deep insight into so many facets of modern American life.<p>My reading habits generally lean towards non-fiction, because I truly believe that fact is many times stranger than fiction.   I really enjoyed this book, and learned a great deal about the generation that came before me (I was born in 1969).<p>Levittown, Korea, The Kinsey Report, McDonalds, General Motors, the Beat Generation, just a few of the topics which Mr. Halberstam thoughtfully weaves into a coloful and detailed whole.<p>Finally, although this is a substantial book in terms of the sheer number of pages, it is also very reader-friendly.  The chapters are broken into distinct topics so that the whole work can be picked-up and put-down over a long period of time without loosing the interest of the reader.<p>Man, would I love to sit down with this gentleman and pick his brain.  Thank you, thank you, thank you David Halberstam.</span>
