                <span id="Label1">Science has never been so easy - or so much fun!  With The Everything Kids' Science Experiments Book, all you need to do is gather a few household items and you can recreate dozens of mind-blowing, kid-tested science experiments.  High school science teach Tom Robinson shows you how to expand your scientific horizons - from biology to chemistry to physics to outer space.  <P>You'll discover answers to questions like:<BR> Is it possible to blow up a balloon without actually blowing into it?<BR> What is inside coins?<BR> Can a magnet ever be "turned off"?<BR> Do toilets always flush in the same direction?<BR> Can a swimming pool be cleaned with just the breath of one person?  <P>Get ready to enter the laboratory and learn how to conduct cool experiments, understand scientific terms like "photosynthesis," and know fun facts like how many latex balloons per day can be made from a rubber tree.  Each section has a great science fair project, complete with all the details you need to wow your teachers and friends.  <P>You won't want to wait for a rainy day or your school's science fair to test these cool experiments for yourself!</span>

                    <span>This is a great book, chock-a-block w/ very accessible experiments. One of the best features is the way the experiments are grouped together: a 'theme' (say, Acids, in the Chemistry section) will have a group of experiments of varying degrees of complexity that together add up to a pretty good understanding of the concept. Also, most of the materials are readily at hand- for many of them we really did already have everything in the house. This is esp. gratifying for the kids, who of course want to do the experiment *right now*. I would imagine that home-schooling families would enjoy this, but our school-going kids enjoy doing these experiments after school & on weekends. <P>p.s., one of the easiest experiments is also a real showstopper, though it takes a couple of days to complete: dissolving the eggshell of an egg, leaving the egg inside intact!</span>

                    <span>I wish I had this book 15 years ago as we spent time at home playing "Mad Scientist" with our young children. Our kids are now all teenagers and have enjoyed exploring Robinson's book. <BR>Children LOVE to experiment with their world. "The Everything Kids' Science Experiments Book" offers parents and kids alike a wide array of adventures in science including: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Science, and the Human Body. This book is oriented to kids ages 7-12 but offers information and exploration for budding scientists of all ages. I appreciate this book's easy entrance into the world of science and the three levels of experiments for each area of science: 1)Simple Home Experiments; 2)More Detailed "Kid's Lab Lessons"; 3)Science Fair Projects. The art layout (including multi-color printing, fun-graphics, puzzles, and side-bars), the splashy presentation of information (including fun facts, words to know, dumb-jokes, online science websites and cool quotes) and a complete index make this book an excellent resource for parents, homeschoolers and science teachers. For two other parenting resources, look into "The Family Cloister" and "The Christian Family Toolbox", both by David Robinson (...)</span>

                    <span>Wow, what a great book! My kids love it. It is set up as a series of activities that begin with a question followed by an experiment that answers the question. Questions such as "How do you peel a raw egg?", "Does air take up space?" and "Why can't I taste medicine when I plug my nose?" are all examples of questions posed in the book. The fun is in the experiment that answers the question. I think I counted something like 30 different experiments from 5 main science areas (biology, chemistry, physics, planet earth, and the human body). Following each area is a "science fair project" for the kids to use at the next science fair at school! What a great resource it will be for our family in the years to come. All in all a great book at a great price.</span>
