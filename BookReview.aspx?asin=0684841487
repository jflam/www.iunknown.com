                <span id="Label1"><P> Now nearing its 60th printing in English and translated into nineteen languages, Michael E. Porter's <I>Competitive Strategy</I> has transformed the theory, practice, and teaching of business strategy throughout the world. Electrifying in its simplicity -- like all great breakthroughs -- Porter's analysis of industries captures the complexity of industry competition in five underlying forces. Porter introduces one of the most powerful competitive tools yet developed: his three generic strategies -- lowest cost, differentiation, and focus -- which bring structure to the task of strategic positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of relative cost and relative prices, thus linking it directly to profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided. In the almost two decades since publication, Porter's framework for predicting competitor behavior has transformed the way in which companies look at their rivals and has given rise to the new discipline of competitor assessment. <P> More than a million managers in both large and small companies, investment analysts, consultants, students, and scholars throughout the world have internalized Porter's ideas and applied them to assess industries, understand competitors,, and choose competitive positions. The ideas in the book address the underlying fundamentals of competition in a way that is independent of the specifics of the ways companies go about competing. <P> <I>Competitive Strategy</I> has filled a void in management thinking. It provides an enduring foundation and grounding point on which all subsequent work can be built. By bringing a disciplined structure to the question of how firms achieve superior profitability, Porter's rich frameworks and deep insights comprise a sophisticated view of competition unsurpassed in the last quarter-century.</span>

                    <span>As Adam Smith is to economics and capitalism, Porter is to business strategy within this market system. <P>This is THE seminal book for defining how businesses compete.<P>As technology fads and internet business models ("New economy") come and go, every company must still address the basics of competition as outlined within this book. The frameworks within the book outline: <BR>-How to assess the competitive structure of your industry,<BR>-Generic competitive strategies<BR>-Competitor Analysis<P>-Effects of market signals on competitive behavior<BR>-Competitive moves in response to your strategy<BR>-Competitve strategy in a number of different market environments<BR>-Impact of strategies such as Vertical integration, growth through new products, scale, and M&A<BR>-... much more<P>You will use this book as a reference, and find it is timeless. It is no wonder the Mr. Porter is widely regarded as the preeminent strategist. <P>To put this in practice I recommend books on gaming theory.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>When I started as a strategy consultant, Porter's Competitive Strategy and the classic five forces model within provided me with a first look at the process and mindset of the pure strategist. A weekend spent reading this book gave me the framework to intelligently analyze company strategy. I've made it required reading for all new employees.<P>If you are a business student (undergrad or MBA) and for some reason you have not read this, read it and assume everyone you interview with has read it. Use its basic principles in a case study interview and you'll pass with flying colors. Anyone in business of any sort should read this book and try applying it to your own business environment. Its pretty amazing how clear your business issues will appear.<P>Now for the negatives. It is very out of date, so do not use any of his observations on any of the industries mentioned. His case studies towards the end of the book are so irrelevant they are not worth reading, just skimming. Read his justifications carefully, since you may find yourself disagreeing with a significant percentage.<P>Despite its age, this is still the primer on strategy. Read this, and then read everything else.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is one of the foundation books of the modern business education. Yes, it was written over twenty years ago and you cannot take a business course anywhere without the term "Porter's Five Forces" not at least being mentioned. But, really, this book is still completely relevant and should be on every businessperson's bookshelf, front and center.<P>For a concept that has so much a place in b-school discussions, you might think the book focuses on the 5-forces, but it is only a small part of the book. It outlines the Generic Competitive Strategies (again, a now well known topic), Competitor Analysis (extremely valuable), Market Signals, Competitive Moves, and so much more.<P>The book is in three parts, General Analytical Techniques, Generic Industry Environments, and Strategic Decisions. There is an appendix on Portfolio Techniques in Competitor Analysis, and a very useful appendix on How to Conduct an Industry Analysis.<P>I think a lot of times this book is not given as active a place in the pantheon as it deserves because so many books and articles are recycling a lot of what was in this book and most don't add much to the discussion. Honestly, this book is worth referring to over and over and over again. It is a tool or a weapon in your competitive war chest that needs to be kept active and in play.</span>

                    <span>A must have. Porter provides students with a great place to start for understanding strategy. While you must know the basics in this book to understand the foundation of strategy,it will not provide you with a dynamic and cutting edge strategic framework that many of today's industries need.</span>
