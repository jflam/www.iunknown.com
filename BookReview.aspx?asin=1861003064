                <span id="Label1">Useful for any developer who works with Microsoft SQL Server databases, <I>Beginning Visual Basic SQL Server 7.0</I> delivers the goods on several key technologies, as well as a thorough introduction to working with SQL Server and its related tools. It's an essential resource for anyone who wants to take advantage of the performance and reusability of server-side stored procedures on the Microsoft platform.<p> This book covers a number of absolutely essential APIs that will be needed by any programmer who works with Microsoft databases. First, the author presents a good introduction to ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), the recommended standard for programming with databases. <p> The text's principle strength has to be its comprehensive tour of Microsoft Transact-SQL (T-SQL), starting with simple SELECT and action queries, to different types of joins between relational tables. What's best here is the author's step-by-step tutorial for each SQL statement, along with an example written using client-side SQL (where the SQL is written in ADO on the client), as well as the same code executed as a stored procedure on the server. (Here ADO is used to invoke server-side T-SQL.) This approach not only provides an excellent introduction to SQL itself, it also furnishes what you need to use stored procedures effectively. Server-side database programming used to be the stuff of experts only, but this book shows how anyone can do it using today's Visual Basic. <p> The title closes with several case studies that show off database front ends for a hypothetical auto dealership. In all, <I>Beginning Visual Basic SQL Server 7.0</I> provides vital material on database programming that can let beginning or intermediate VB developers take their skills to the next level and get the most out of Microsoft database tools and technologies. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: History of Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server database files and tables, normalization, Visual Basic DB APIs (OLE DB, ODBC, and ADO), installation hints, using the SQL Server Enterprise Manager, Query Analyzer, Profiler, creating database objects, SQL Server security, roles and object security, ADO objects, DSN and DSN-less database connections, using the Visual Basic Data Environment Designer, stored procedures and Transact SQL (T-SQL) basics, select, insert, update and delete procedures, joins, server-side vs. client-side database programming with SQL, creating database user interfaces, building business components with VB, using binary data, performance issues, backups, and sample case studies.</span>

                    <span>Don't let the one star reviewer put you off. This is a good book available at a bargain 2nd-hand price. The joke below about fitting this content into a book of 250 pages shows that another reviewer doesn't know what he's talking about. But the examples are a bit OTT as the case studies are large so there's a bit of repetition. It could probably have been shrunk to about 700 pages (rather than 900) with smaller (kiddy type) case studies. Likewise it's not possible to overdo normalization - just because some so-called professionals don't bother with it as much as they should is no reason why a beginner shouldn't learn best practice.<P>The writer assumes that you already know Visual Basic 6 so doesn't cover much VB code. The focus is on SQL Server 7 stored procedures which are professionally done. <P>The "Beginning" title is a bit misleading too. This is a book for serious programmers who, although still beginners, want to be good - not for hackers.<P>The book is well made with hardly any errors that I've spotted and the code examples work.<P>I recommend Vieira's two books as well - on SQL Server 7 and 2000.<P>4 stars only (nearly 5) - the case studies are a little larger than need be.</span>

                    <span>This book is one of the best I've found to learn SQL 7.0 by. Don't let the "Visual Basic" part confuse you. The book is a practical guide on all aspects of SQL 7.0 from installation, database creation, and data manipulation, to the application of the concepts in real-world application examples. The explanations are step-by-step, thorough and very clear so that a novice user can understand fully and quickly become able to create and deploy SQL databases. And once you're ready for more, Vieira's "Professional SQL Server 7.0" is a great follow-up book to this one.</span>

                    <span>I own 2 books written by Thearon Willis, this book and "Beginning SQL Server 2000 for Visual Basic Developers". Both books are excellent. Combining this book and Rob Vieira's "Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming", I got a very knowledgeable skill set that combines Visual Basic 6.0/5.0, SQL Server 7.0 and RDO/DAO. If you have to maintain applications written in Visual Basic 6.0 and earlier or if the database is SQL Server 7.0, you will want to read this book. Please note: if you want to use latest ADO, you may have make some minor modifications to the examples in this books.</span>

                    <span>I've been a software engineer for just over 20 years now, and to this date, this author is by far, the most talented author, I've encountered. The book covers all that is required, for a Visual Basic developer, to learn the tasks associated with building applications for Visual Basic using SQL. With other books, it never failed that the author would leave something important out, when demonstrating a technique, but the author of this book, Thearon Willis, covers everything, down to the intimate detail. Thearon also has reminders through out the book, that remind the reader not to forget to do something, that may have already been covered. I believe the author has the ability to convey upon the reader, in an understandable manner, like no other author has.<P>Many Thanks</span>
