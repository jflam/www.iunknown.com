                    <span>First off, THIS IS NOT A BIAST REVIEW! 
<br />This movie, or more like a story, as many pros, only to be balanced out with many cons.
<br />PROS: >A glimpse of war in soldiers' and parents' perspectives
<br />      >A revelation of some of the truth
<br />      >Many tear-wrenching moments
<br />CONS: >Packed to the brim with exaggeration
<br />Overall, a fine film....
<br />P.S. Notice how I don't use the word documentary.

                    <span>Moore says there is no terrorist threat?  Tell that to the 3,000 dead and hundreds murdered in Israel by bombers whose families were rewarded by Saddam.  Moore says Saddam made no threats against the US, but meanwhile Usay's newspapers flagrantly pronounced "Death to America".  It's OK for Usay to pronounce virulant hatred, but Saddam is not a threat?  This piece of garbage is one of the greatest propaganda films since Leni Reifenstahl.  Moore also illustrates how the Bin Laden family were the first to fly out of America and had "special priveledges".  Well my tree hugging friends, they were not allowed to fly out until 13 Sept., when the airlines first returned to flying.  If you were a Bin Laden family member, would you too have not been on the first plane out of the US?   I don't understand how Moore's film is not held to scrutiny.  I guess he feels that he got lucky being allowed to sucessfully lie to Americans and the rest of the world who salivated off of this propoganda.  
<br />Moore further documents that Bush sat around and didn't do anything for 7 minutes.  Well, he is the Commander in Chief and there are safeguards allowed where he doesn't have to overreact in front of second graders and run.  President Bush is the first president to have an MBA and he sat for several minutes calculating, knowing full well that his though processes were being documented for all to judge, and if he jumped up and reacted, that too would have been criticized.  If his staff thought that it was expedient for him to jump up and react; they would have certainly done so, instead he set an example as a leader and handled the situation in a business like manner, which was his job, a business-man in a political position, running the largest $ business in the world.
<br />Without any shame, Michael Moore capitalizes on soldier's who nobley gave their lives for the sake of freedom across the world, and Moore shamelessly exploits and desecrates their sacred funerals and injuries, in order to line his pockets, providing a shameless terrible theme entirely out of context.  Moore is the worst American alive today and perhaps the worst since Benedict Arnold, who was probably a better American because at least at one time he was head of West Point in the military, Moore could not fit into a uniform if he wanted to.  Benedict Arnold died a death known to traitors, our democracy allows Moore to perpetuate his cowardly behavior, and he shows his appreciation by exploiting our soldier's (this country's greatest asset) funerals and manipualing people's emotions by telling outrageous lies.  Regarding the latter, Hitler did the same thing, yet Moore is heralded by the left.  The left is incapable of giving credit where credit is due.  So rather than play fair, they cheat and lie and do everything in their power to get their way.</span>

                    <span>Of all of the people who have given this bundle of ham-fisted propoganda favorable reviews I ask: don't the events of the last six months make you feel a little silly? With events in the Middle East proving the validity of the Bush Doctrine faster than even the most optomistic of us could have hoped, this film looks about as relevant (and accurate) as "Reefer Madness". </span>

                    <span> Any American who doesn't live in a cave could tell you that. With Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore presents his admittedly biased case against Bush and the war being waged in Iraq. Unfortunately, when you're watching a Michael Moore film, you never know what to think because the only information you are privy to is presented to support his own views.
<br />
<br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is split up into basically two parts: the first is an indictment of President George W. Bush, the way he has run the country, and his motives for starting a war in Iraq; the second focuses on the people fighting the war, and is easily the better piece of the film.
<br />
<br />Moore makes the case that the presidential election of 2000 was a sham because votes from racial minorities were not counted appropriately, and that had they been, Al Gore would have won the election. Regardless, we all know that Bush did win, and in August of 2001, he decided to take a rather long vacation, with which some in the country took issue. Bush didn't seem to be terribly serious about his job--until September 11, and we all know what happened then.
<br />
<br />What was our president doing when he heard the news that two planes hit the World Trade Center in New York? Reading to children in Florida. What did he do for seven full minutes after hearing this news? Absolutely nothing. Why? Well, this film provides us with some background, linking the Bin Laden family with the Bush family through the oil industry, in which both families are major players. So, members of the Bin Laden clan were rounded up and flown out of the country immediately after the terrorist attacks on the WTC. Why?
<br />
<br />Fahrenheit 9/11 also accuses Bush of manufacturing the war in Iraq, claiming that he invented ties between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda and weapons of mass destruction in order to rally the American people behind the war effort, which was only for his own personal financial gain. Is this true? Who knows?
<br />
<br />So where does this film succeed? It succeeds in telling the story of Lila Lipscomb, a Flint, Michigan native who, when we first meet her, is a fervent military supporter, citing that the military helps young people who otherwise wouldn't have a chance to get education and travel the world. However, after her son is killed in combat in Iraq, Ms. Lipscomb becomes disillusioned, questioning why her son had to die, and what good it did for anybody.
<br />
<br />Moreso than in his other films, Michael Moore managed to stay off camera for a good part of Fahrenheit 9/11, though his voice is heard throughout in narration. When he is on the screen, he is usually grandstanding, like when he asks for Congressmen to enlist their own children in the military. A true documentarian observes and lets the audience make a judgment for themselves, but that is not Moore's M.O. He wants to present an impartial story, and he does, and I wish I could believe every word of it, but with Moore, you never really know. </span>
