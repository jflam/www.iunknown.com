                <span id="Label1">It was a time when technology was king, status was determined by your high score, and videogames were blitzing the world...<br /> <br /> From Pong to Pac-Man, Asteroids to Zaxxon--more than fifty million people around the world have come of age within the electronic flux of videogames, their subconscious forever etched with images projected from arcade and home videogame systems.<br /> <br /> From the first interactive blips of electronic light at Brookhaven National Labs and the creation of Spacewar! at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; to the invention of the TV Game Project and the myriad systems of Magnavox, Atari, Coleco, and Mattel that followed; through the rise of the Golden Age of videogames and forward into the imagination of millions, Supercade is the first book to illustrate and document the history, legacy, and visual language of the videogame phenomenon.<br /> <br /> Exuberantly written and illustrated in full color, Supercade pays tribute to the technology, games, and visionaries of one of the most influential periods in the history of computer science--one that profoundly shaped the modern technological landscape and helped change the way people view entertainment.<br /> <br /> <i>Supercade</i> includes contributions from such commentators and particpants as Ralph Baer, Julian Dibbell, Keith Feinstein, Joe Fielder, Lauren Fielder, Justin Hall, Leonard Herman, Steven Johnson, Steven Kent, Nick Montfort, Bob Parks, Carl Steadman, and Tom Vanderbilt.</span>

                    <span>I'm 33 and cut my teeth on Firetruck, Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Dkong. Having been involved with the Mame project for 6 years, which attempts to preserve arcade games through emulation, I'm always interested to read new books on this subject. Supercade caught my attention with its gaudy presentation and heft. It's a glossy collection of easily smudged pages with screenshots taken from Mame with rudimentary Photoshop filters applied along with some image skewing, and flyers and cabinets shots also from the collection/emulation community. Most of the screenshots are accompanied by short descriptions that could easily have come verbatim from Mame's history.dat file, originally compiled by Brian Deuel. One could also imagine the author going through Mame32's year folders one by one looking for tasty tidbits to present as one-offs or games not as mass produced as Pac-Man. Steven Kent's books do a better job burrowing into the stories behind these games and I enjoyed his writing style more than this author. All that said it does still have merit in that it nicely lumps all of this together in what could be described as a coffee table style art book. It may provide an accessible entry to the classic gaming genre for the newbie, but the hardcore will already have delved into other more mature offerings on the subject, including Mame itself which this book owes for much of its information.</span>

                    <span>Van Burnham has put together a pretty impressive and lively book about the history of the Bronze and Golden Ages of video games. The book is very colorful, with lots (and I mean LOTS) of borrowed pictures and MAME screenshots, each with a story or small blurb about the particular subject at hand. Burnham covers both arcade and home console video games in this piece.<P>Some neat extras include interviews with designers/programmers, a story by a Starcade game show contestent, and a fairly complete timeline. Burnham has done her research, filling the book with detailed historical record of the first video game (Spacewar!), the first interactive CRT game (Willy's Tennis For Two), and the MIT railroad club, among others. There are a few problems, however.<P>The layout of the pictures is a filled with lots of unnecessary filtering (i.e. the "old and grey" Commodore PET... we had color photography in the 1970s too!) and blurring, and can get garish at times. You could even say artsy-fartsy or pretentious. There are also some minor historical errors. Tapper is a Bally Midway creation (the book calls it "Atari's Tapper"). Activisions's Alan Miller didn't design Atari's arcade Football; Dave Stubbins, Steve Bristow, and Mike Albaugh did. I also think that Burnham, in her game blurbs and descriptions, tended to be a little less colorful; preferring to copy verbatim from her research. This gives the impression that quantity took precidence over quality. The reader could get the impression that the author got a bit lazy towards the end of compiling this book, in the process of cramming in as many games as possible.<P>Other than these minor gripes, this book is a solid "period piece" that belongs on any classic gaming fan's coffee table.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, I had bought the other similar historical reference books on the subject and saved this one for last because I took the bad reviews about the photo quality seriously. I work in printing/graphic design and I avoided buying the book until the price came down. After thumbing through it for only five minutes, I knew I'd found the best one. Yes, it may be true that many of the images could have lifted from MAME screen shots but here's my take on that. I was looking for the best VISUAL record of the era. That's what this about isn't it? Walking into an arcade today may have the same visual appeal with all the lights and noises, but since the late 80's, our expectations obviously changed. No one can milk a quarter for more than 3 minutes anymore. My memories of the old arcades are the unique characters, the first time that we were able to play with multiple players and all those other "firsts" that influenced what we see today. This "found art" really takes me back in time. The images may only be low rez screen shots, but for the most part they are clean and made more fun by being enlarged to the point where you can see all the pixels. I think the word from art school I'm trying to remember is MACRO. Where you zoom IN to a particular piece of the image and crop it to make it more interesting visually. These photos are big and bleed beyond the edge of the page. It's funny now to how those huge pixels made us spend so much in the 80's in our era or super slick realism in current games. While THE FIRST QUARTER and THE ULTIMATE HISTORY OF VIDEO GAMES may be a "good read" for historical facts and funny stories, they lacked imagery. The book ARCADE FEVER is another strong visual book for it's sharp photography of actual game cabinets and more traditional screen shots. Supercade is an artsy (but not cheesy) way of showing the era. I was also happy to see arcade games featured that came along years after 1984. This book goes the extra mile visually.</span>

                    <span>Van Burnham's book is a true piece of art - it doesn't try to exhaustively present historical data, or be all-inclusive. It offers to take the reader for a ride through the star system that some call the Golden Age of Video Games. She gives us visual glimpses of some of the brightest stars, with just enough narrative to give depth to the experience.<P>This book is the real thing - it comes from the heart, which is rare these days especially among classic videogame junkies. It manages to convey the sense of awe and wonder that one may have felt when standing in a darkened arcade room in 1980.<P>A rare gem, and a classic in its own right. Long live Van Burnham!</span>
