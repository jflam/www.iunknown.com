                    <span>This book is OK if you actually have a product to sell. If your business, like mine, is a service business this book offers little help in creating "Off the Wall" marketing ideas. At least 70% of the book involves high dollar radio, TV, and other expensive marketing ideas. Very little practical examples of non budget busting ideas...</span>

                    <span>By page 17, I had to stop reading to go email my boss all of the ideas that "Off-the-Wall Marketing Ideas" had sparked.  It was such a jewel to find.  I actually went to the book store to flip through "The Anatomy of Buzz."  After flipping through it, I felt that a different book would serve me better.   I bought "Off-the-Wall Marketing Ideas" due to the user friendly layout.  I felt that it would be easy to reference time and again.  After reading the book cover to cover, I realized that buying "Off-the-Wall Marketing Ideas" was the best investment I've made in a long while.</span>
