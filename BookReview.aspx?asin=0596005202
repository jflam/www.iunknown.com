                    <span>I concur with other reviewers on the following points:
<br />
<br />1) The organization is good and focuses strictly on the relevant web classes in .NET.
<br />
<br />2) The documentation, however, is more or less a repeat of ASP.NET information from MSDN.  In a lot of O'Reilley Nutshell books, the authors typically add more insight to the classes they cover that the official documentation does not.  With this book, I really did not get that impression.
<br />
<br />If you need an offline version of the MSDN documentation, this is great.  Another detraction is that the book does not come with a documentation add-in CD like the other .NET in a Nutshell books.
<br />
<br />3) The most egregious fault with this book is that the authors do NOT tell you that the book is mostly in VB.NET syntax.  I'm trying to learn C# and the book's latter parts is all VB.NET.  I really wish the authors were upfront about this, so I could save myself some money. *sigh*
<br />
<br />Future ASP.NET Authors: If you're going to write about ASP.NET, please specify, somewhere on the cover or in the introduction, the language you will be using for examples.
<br />
<br />C# programmers may be better off reading Programming ASP.NET by Jesse Libery and Dan Hurwitz or similar books, which uses C# for its examples.</span>

                    <span>The description of this book says it's for ASP developers transitioning to ASP.NET.  I have worked with ASP for over a year, and this book was pretty much useless.  The only redeeming factor was that I was able to get it from my local library, so I found out before it cost me any cash.  The first part of the book delves into topics with zero explanation, and very little code, so you don't have a chance to get your feet wet with actual code, and the topics are dull and dry.  The last portion of the book looks like it would be a nice reference, but honestly, why would you buy a book like this for a reference?  Isn't that what the 'net is for?<p>Two thumbs down.  I'm working through a Sam's teach yourself in 21 days book and it is significantly better for anyone transitioning from classic ASP or learning ASP.NET from scratch,</span>

                    <span>I've been reading O'Reilly since the days of the tiny fifty page staple-bound brown Nutshell books that covered shell commands and the first version of Perl. This book is that has taken that same approach to data condensation and applied it to everything you need to know about ASP.NET. And extend they have at almost a thousand pages it is far heavier than the original books, but that doesn't make it any less worthwhile. <p>The first section covers all of the conceptual introductions to the topics, .NET controls, web services, configuration and security and all of the basics. The second section covers each section of the class library in a concise and consistent form that make it so much easier to grab for the book before you even press F1 to bring up the MSDN. Where necessary they include code fragments to demonstrate the point along with the explanatory text but it is never overblown or unnecessary. <p>This isn't light bedtime reading but it is an invaluable reference to sit next to the keyboard of any ASP.NET programmer.</span>

                    <span>Just bought the 2nd edition and I was looking forward to the CD with the Visual Studio .Net doc'n plug-in, but when I received the book it didn't have the CD.  I called O'Reilly and customer support told me that they had decided not to include the CD, and Amazon just has an old image of the cover (O'Reilly has the "old" cover image too then!).<p>I had installed the add-in for other O'Reilly nutshell books (ADO.Net and Windows Forms) and found them to be useful, and thus I was disappointed that this book is not including the CD.  Perhaps O'Reilly is planning to sell a plug-in for all of the FCL, and that is why the CD was pulled...</span>

                    <span>I really liked this book and its format. Perhaps it was just me but everytime I was looking for a particular solution I found it quickly. The book unlike some other nutshell books actaully does a very very good job of explaining the concepts as you code which is exactly the way I like to work.</span>
