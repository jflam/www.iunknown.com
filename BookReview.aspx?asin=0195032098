                    <span>	    Although perhaps best known for "Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945" (1999), much of David Kennedy's earlier work centered on Progressivism and early twentieth-century social history. His 369-page monograph, "Over Here: The First World War and American Society" (1980) followed a decade after his editing of "Social Thought in America and Europe" (1970) and "Progressivism: The Critical Issues" (1971). Significantly, Kennedy wrote in the mid-1970s on "War and the American Character."[1] The influence of these earlier studies is evident in "Over Here." Using "the occasion of the war as a window through which to view early twentieth-century American society," Kennedy explores Progressivism's support for "the historic departure of the United States from isolation and all that isolation implied." (vii) How "millions of persons in the strikingly voluntaristic and fragmented society that was early twentieth-century America" were (or even if they were) disciplined and mobilized "in a manner from which history and geography had theretofore singularly spared them" (viii) is the book's central theme. "The answers," contends Kennedy, "reveal much about the historical moment through which American society was then passing...the peculiarities of American history when contrasted with...other peoples...[and] about abiding features of American national character." (viii)
<br />	
<br />	     Kennedy finds that largely through its successes in molding public opinion, the Wilson administration led Progressives to support the war in the belief that it would further their aims. However, under wartime stressors, Wilson proved to be a reactionary and less committed to Progressive ideals than Dewey and other Progressives who followed him to war had hoped or believed. Kennedy documents the slide towards authoritarian management that characterized the one-hundred percent Americanism of the war years. The disillusionment of the war progressives is a foreshadowing of the "tale of death, broken hopes, frustrated dreams, and...curious defeat-in-victory that was Woodrow Wilson's, and the nation's, bitter lot." (ix) Progressivism was a casualty of war.
<br />		
<br />	     Kennedy organizes the book thematically following a rough chronology. He details the use of wartime propaganda and its effects, the impact of the War on the American economy and political scene, as well as the international dimensions of "The Political Economy of War." He spends two chapters focusing on the Army: first on the conscription of millions of Americans that had no previous experience with the military (or the federal government in any form other than the post-office for the most part!), and then on their experience on the Western front. Unlike Edward Coffman's The War to End All Wars (1986) or The Regulars (2004), Kennedy is not concerned with the view from the staff officers or from men in the trenches; he focuses on the political impact of Pershing's limited successes during America's comparatively brief experience in France. 
<br />		
<br />	     The focus of the book goes beyond how the War impacted American society to investigate "those aspects of the American experience in the First World War" the author takes "to be crucial for an understanding of modern American history. Despite its subject matter, Over Here is hardly what many historians consider military history; however, it is just that. Kennedy takes a very broad look at how the War caused certain aspects of what he sees as the national character to emerge under the stressors of that conflict. Kennedy's book is in a class with Cecilia O'Leary's To Die For: The Paradox of American Patriotism (1999) and Alan Dawley's Changing the World: American Progressives in War and Revolution (2003) in its perception of American nationalism and the impact of the war on politics and society. One might even compare its conclusions to Allen Matusow's "Unraveling of America: A History of Liberalism in the 1960s"-both authors claim their political eras are casualties of their respective wars.
<br />		
<br />	     David Kennedy masterfully handles the interconnected complexities of Progressivism, nationalism, Wilsonian idealism, and political economy. However, his treatment of the army as an institution and the effects of conscription on both the American home front and for America's citizen-soldiers raises more questions than it attempts to answer. The high political tone and level of analysis taken preclude Kennedy's concentration on these important issues. As good as Kennedy's study is, its failure to address these issues leaves it incomplete.

                    <span>The irony of war tugs at the souls of those who have not actually experienced it.  David Kennedy's OVER HERE:  THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND AMERICAN SOCIETY is a good social and cultural assessment of what occurred on American soil during World War I.  American nationalism prevailed, and the United States emerged from its isolationism to help their European brethrens from German invasion.  Despite the patriotic pomp and circumstance and extreme volunteerism by more than 50,000 young American men who became a part of independent armies that helped to form the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), the war ended with much disappointment both politically and economically as well as the loss of a generation from the European and US front.
<br />
<br />OVER HERE is a comprehensive study, at this point, for its genre and focus on American society.  It crosses the boundaries between literary and historical significance during this period in American history known as the Great War.  Kennedy did a fine job sifting through archives of material to present an exceptional and readable piece of scholarship that helps readers understand the social aspects of World War I and the period of 1917-1919.  He covers most of the major issues that have typified the war and the aftermath of the war, such as nationalism, repressed dissent, disillusionment, and xenophobia.  This was the first modernized and mechanized war that simply was not fully prepared for its consquences.  This was the period in which mass communication played a significant role in communicating both views of the war from Progressives, Populists to pacificists -- propaganda came into vogue with mass publications and depictions of the "enemy" as well as the "doughboys".
<br />
<br />This is a highly recommended book that concentrates on the US homefront, and occassionally refers to the war front.  It supplements previous and current research that explores the war that, unfortunately, was not the war to end all wars.  However, for those who did not return, their legacy is embedded in history as well as frozen in time.  The war dead would later be symbolized through complex postmodern interpretations and proportions, and collective memory for those who survived.    </span>

                    <span>Kennedy's masterful look at World War I society in America proves to rank among the best accounts of the early twentieth century. He covers those who joined the war effort, the war effort at home and abroad, and the various issues relative to the Wilson Administration in terms of effectiveness and quality with a certain sophisticated nature that makes this work a must-have for undergraduate and/or graduate level U.S. history classes. Kennedy's obvious strengths are evident in his coverage of war and the Wilson administration yet it must be noted that his lack of bias must also be taken as a strength.</span>

                    <span>I so enjoyed Kennedy's Freedom From Fear that when I saw this book I wanted to read it.  But it is not nearly as "popular" a work as Freedom from Fear.  Two or three chapters are hard to get interested in, I thought.  He does talk about the AEF's time in Europe, and seems much more deprecating toward it than is usual from American authors.  For instance, The Defeat of Imperial Germany 1917-1918 by Rod Paschall, while it may over-emphasize the role of the AEF, is, I think a needed corrective to Kennedy's down-playing of the American role in World War One.<br>As the books Kennedy relies on have made clear (e.g., Opponents of War 1917-1918, by H. C. Peterson and Gilbert C. Fite), the record of the Wilson Administration in the field of civil liberties in wartime to a present-day viewer is sobering, the legal system seemingly surrendering to the war hysteria (as some today seem to again urge it do).  The book also has an insightful discussion of the contrast between American writing about the war compared to the more pessimistic view of men who were more sated by their longer involvment in the hell which was the Western front.  Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of interesting stuff in this book--it is just that some chapters may not be overly exciting to a non-economist, for instance.</span>

                    <span>"Over Here" is an important and clearly-written work in a much-neglected area of historical inquiry--the homefront during time of war in foreign lands. It provides a nice supplement to the classic accounts of WWI that focus more on the battlefields, like Barabara Tuchman's "The Guns of August." <p>Over Here describes the unthinkable degree of xenophobia and repression of dissent that the Wilson administration, particularly Postmaster General Albert Sidney Burleson and Attorney General Thomas W. Gregory, directed and encouraged, and recounts horrible tales, such as the Prager and Goddard incidents, that should live on forever as warnings against future state support of vigilantism and "100 Percent Americanism." This is especially relevant these days in light of Attorney General Ashcroft's war on civil liberties and the revival of the evil specter of 100 Percent Americanism by the famous xenophobe Pat Buchanan. While today's assaults on liberty are not yet nearly as dastardly as those during WWI, Over Here's historical record serves as a clear warning against repeating past errors and a stunning indictment of the enemies of open society, past and present. <p>The book also stands as a caution against the dangers of concentrated government power, particularly during wartime, and of excessive and naÃ¯ve confidence in the capacity of the government to do good. It confirms the Libertarian Harry Browne's warning: "Beware of politicians with good intentions." <p>President Wilson was a Progressive former professor who came to office with optimistic views on improving the lot of the common man by expanding the role of government in domestic affairs and actively promoting peace in the world. Early in his administration, Wilson's words inspired hope in socialists and other leftists around the world. It is particularly credible, therefore, when a fellow progressive/liberal academic like Professor Kennedy describes how, in practice, Wilson did not have the courage of his convictions and some of his ideas turned out not to work as well in the real world as they did in the lecture halls of academia. His behavior as President was characterized by trepidation and cowardice. Instead of prosperity and harmony at home and peace and unity in the world, fledgling labor unions and leftist dissent were ruthlessly crushed at home and the world remained bitterly divided after the end of a brutal and demoralizing war. Instead of progress for workers and a "war to end all wars," the international left was disillusioned and the seeds were sown for a second, more devastating war to come.<p>Over Here is a great work of scholarship that is also eminently readable and concise, so that both the historian and the layperson should enjoy it immensely. Despite the author's progressive slant, he applies a light touch in the book that should make it palatable for most conservatives, largely leaving the reader to make one's own conclusions, though the case is made sufficiently strongly that the conclusions are nearly inevitable. The author does eloquently summarize his case on the book jacket, saying the book is "in many ways a sad story, a tale of death, broken hopes, frustrated dreams, and of the curious defeat-in-victory that was Woodrow Wilson's and the nation's, bitter lot." This book well earned its recognition as a Pulitzer Prize Finalist.<p>"This is a war to end all wars." --Woodrow Wilson<br>"Only the dead have seen the end of war." --George Santayana's counter to Wilson's quote</span>
