                    <span>I purchased this book a couple of years ago with the desire to improve my vocabulary before leaving college and entering the business world.  I had low expectations, and they were met and exceeded.  Here are some of the high points:
<br />
<br />- The book includes a beginning examination to test your vocabulary prowess.  
<br />
<br />- Each chapter groups words together that have the same etymological background.  This is key in helping you remember definitions in the long run.
<br />
<br />-Each chapter teaches/tests the pronunciation, definition, and forms of each word.
<br />
<br />Overall, you cannot go wrong with this text.  The only behavior I strongly suggest is that you do not take a break from this book.  It becomes very difficult to jump back at a later time.</span>

                    <span>This is the greatest vocabulary book I've read to date.  The latin roots taught in this book make it possible to recognize zounds of words not presented in these pages but in every day life.  Also the words provided here are frequently used in our daily environment so it really does help to be familiar with them.  There are also interesting little tid bits about common usage of language, and what is socially acceptible (if inaccurate by its original meaning).  There are interesting tid bits such as a list of all the phobias.  It's fun to quiz my know-it-all friends on their vocabulary, or better yet correct them ; )  As far as difficulty, I would say this book gives you a graduate level non-specialized vocabulary, but it does make a difference when reading, speaking to educated people, or taking entrance exams such as the GRE.  I keep this book in my bathroom for frequent and brief reviews.  No matter what your vocabulary, you won't know all of these latin roots, and you should.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book. My vocabulary increased immensely. I highly recommend this book for those who want to impress people in the way they speak professionally or colloquially. This book gave me the confidence to give presentations; I was never at a lost for words while speaking in front of a group. If you are someone like me who believes that words give so much power, then you will want to ensure you maximize your understanding of the choices of words you can use. 
<br />
<br />Also, this book is designed to introduce a word to you then expand on that word so you have a solid understanding of that word and related words.

                    <span>I first discovered this book in High School, when my English teacher made us read it. To be quite honest, I had mostly forgotten about it until recently when someone asked me how I had such a vast vocabulary. I remembered this book and had to buy it again and refresh my memory.<p>This book doesn't just teach you words and their meanings (that's called a dictionary); it teaches you how to figure out the meaning of a word. Word Power Made Easy (WPME) takes a big word and breaks it down to its roots, explaining how that word came to being.<p>Amazingly, this book also helps with foreign languages (at least latin based), because if you can break down English words and figure out their meaning, it makes it that much easier to break down an Italian or a Spanish word and discover that the roots for both the English and the Italian are similar enough.<p>There are tests for you to practice on and by the end of the book, you feel as if you can understand anything a pretentious person might say to you. The most fun I've had is that now the pattern of word creation has been explained, I can create my own words for things that are undescribable and other people will know and understand what I'm saying. A little like Edgar Allen Poe.</span>

                    <span>I was referred this book by a number of people. So I borrowed it from a friend. I used it to prepare for my GRE exam (I'll still go for Kaplan or Princeton). The book claims to make is easy to learn words. I must admit it is not what it claims to be, but still is a very good book none the less. I still find it an interesting reading. The approach here is to help learn words using etymology. While you come across a lot of words that can be etymologically derived (Juggernaut, Chronology, Insect ...) but such words may not be recognizable to the uneducated eye (the book claims to teach you) and not a whole lot of words you come across have an etymology based on a word you already know (that's how the book works - you must be familiar with either the root word or a word of similar etymology.)<p> Having said that, I must explain why I rate it so high. This book makes sure you know and remember the words it teaches you. Unlike other books that gives you meanings like a dictionary would or a book that groups words based on a particular attribute and wants you to learn them, this book has a method that works. The etymology is ingrained into your mind (for quite some time) partly because the Author keeps blabbering on and on about the word and partly because he gives you a lot of related words. You learn both by repetition and association.<p> Now what makes it 5 star. Simple, the book introduced me to the world of etymology. I found it very interesting and still do. I still try to find the etymology of words (etymology is more interesting then genealogy) I find etymology has become a part of how I look at words. Thanks to this book I enjoy words like English~German six~sechs, seven~sieben, I~ich, thou~du; English~Sanskrit Juggernaut~Jaggannath, Brother~bhatra, Mother~matra; English~French Dandelion~dent de lion (almost half the words in English are related to French words)<p> Pick this book to become an amateur etymologist. Read one chapter a day, you will know a lot in a month without ever getting bored. Enjoy the grammar lessons and exercise at the end of chapters. You will know a lot of words by the end of the month but not as many the author would want you to believe. Another thing those words are part of the "GRE most probable" list.</span>
