        <p><P>I have never <A href="../About/fog0000000013.html">written</A> a solo book. At various points in my life, I felt that I have had a story to tell, but have never gotten around to putting words onto paper. This holiday season, I saw some of my friends <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201740958/qid=1009921511/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_3_1/107-1596383-3252568">publish</A> <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201753065/qid=1009921579/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1_1/107-1596383-3252568">new</A> books, so I've gotten the bug once again. </P>
<P>Unlike my friends, I refuse to succumb to the enormity of the pressure that is created by a book contract. If you ever wondered how much pain is involved in writing a book, look no further than my friend Jeff Prosise's <A href="http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors/prosise/blog/default.asp?page=1">book web log</A>. As I get older, I get more and more skilled at avoiding unnecessary pain and suffering. So, I'm going take a page out of <A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</A> and <A href="http://www.mindview.net/Etc/FAQ.html#BooksOnWeb">Bruce Eckel's</A> books: publish a book on the web, and then turn it into a dead tree version later on. That way you, the reader, get the information hot off the press. More importantly, it means that I don't have to commit to a schedule ;) What could be better than that?</P>
<P>So, what am I going to write about? A topic that is near and dear to my heart: the Common Language Runtime. As part of <A href="../About/fog0000000008.html">the product</A> that I'm building, I'm getting an opportunity to explore many nooks and crannies of the CLR that most folks have never seen before. The goal of this book is to share with you my findings as I spend all of my waking moments experimenting with, and writing software for the CLR. </P>
<P>Among all of the writers whose works that I have read, none stand above <A href="http://www.aristeia.com/">Scott Meyers</A> and his Effective (<A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201924889/qid=1009921664/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_71_1/107-1596383-3252568">C++</A>, <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020163371X/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/107-1596383-3252568">More C++</A>, <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201749629/ref=pd_sim_books/107-1596383-3252568">STL</A>) series of books. Scott recognized that developers like to digest things in bite-sized chunks. Scott also recognized that developers don't have time to read page after page of prose that serve nothing more than to frame technical information using a story of the author's devising. In an <A href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=homage">homage</A> to Scott, this is the format that <EM>Inside the CLR</EM>&nbsp;will adopt.[1]</P>
<P>The book will be framed in terms of a series of chapters that collect related topics together, and will take form&nbsp; over some period of time. Individual web log entries <A href="../Weblog/fog0000000047.html">like</A> <A href="../Weblog/fog0000000049.html">these</A> will form the basis of the research for the individual Items that will appear in the book. I'm still working on the book's outline, and I suspect it will very much be in flux as I go. If you keep reading the web log, you will pretty much see all of the content (and probably a lot of content that will never make it into the book) as I create it. </P>
<P>Please <A href="mailto:jlam@iunknown.com">send me feedback</A> about the individual weblog entries. At some point in time when I get a web server set up in a place where I don't have to worry about bandwidth issues, I'll setup a feedback forum. Enjoy!</P>
<P>[1] For astute readers who have read this web log entry earlier, you will notice that the title of the book project has changed. This was due to some gentle nudging from some friends of mine who are working on a CLR Internals project of their own. I'll leave it up to them to announce their intentions (and who they are) when they are ready. However, the directory name on this web site for this project will remain CLRInternals since I don't believe in <A href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">breaking links on the web</A>.</P><img src="../Images/blue_button.jpg" alt="Permanent Link" width="18" height="18" align="top"></p>
