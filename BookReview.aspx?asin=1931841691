                    <span>This simply has to be *the* best game programming book I've read to date. It's packed full of *useful* information, and will most likely keep me busy for awhile :) I'd recommend this to anyone seeking real knowledge about real programming problems and their solutions. Even if you already know most of the techniques discussed, this is a great book to have close by as a refference guide. Personally, it has become invaluable.</span>

                    <span>This book was pretty good. Basically I'd like to echo the other favorable reveiws for this title. A lot of good info for those learning game development.<P>Also, something another reviewer commented on. Another reviewer stated that 99% of games for the PC do not use OpenGL on the PC. This could not be more wrong. Just about every game released for the PC gives you an option to view the game using Direct3D or OpenGL. Every major, and most minor, games programmed out there are programmed in both OpenGL and Direct3D. So anything learned about OpenGL is definately relevant.</span>

                    <span>I give it 3 stars because I am just an amateur beginner and any book with information like this book really appeals.<BR>On the other hand, I would like to congratulate those for exposing the negative aspects of the book. I hope the publishers take heed to whats been said and raise the standards higher for subsequent books. However, that does not mean that the price should be raised significantly. I certainly don't think this book is worth 69 bucks after all thats been said(maybe only half the price). I do not care if I am just an amateur, I would prefer value for money.</span>

                    <span>I thought the book was helpful for beginners. I mean lets face it, you can't turn someone who doesn't know anything about programming games into an expert. Beginners have to start small and with the basics, and I think this book is the first step towards that goal (developing games in the industry).</span>

                    <span>I have this book and I've found it a useful addition to my game dev shelf. However, I couldn't help noticing the problems some of the other reviewers had with the book. Now, I'm sure these other reviewers are of a high level intelligence, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming they simply arrived at some misunderstandings due to a hasty evaluation of the book. For example, one reviewer expressed great distress at the inclusion of the "Introduction to dev studio" and "C++ primer" chapters. Actually, these sections of the book are not part of the main content; rather, they are included as appendices. As mentioned earlier, I'm sure the reviewer was in this case making a simple mistake, as he seems to be extremely knowledgeable about the game development process and the industry at large. He makes various complaints about unnecessary portions of the book (i.e. ASCII table) being included to bloat up the page count. Since I am sure this reviewer is of a high level of intelligence, I'm going to accredit this claim to a brief lapse in cognitive function, possibly one due to epileptic seizure. Similar complaints are made in regard to the inclusion of entire-page chapter headers, and the like. These, also, are probably related to epileptic seizures on the part of the reviewer, since I am sure he is of a high level of intelligence. While some of the complaints made by the reviewer on the uselessness of certain chapters are, in some remote way, slightly valid, his negative perception of the book as a whole is, in my ever humble opinion, hugely flawed.</span>
