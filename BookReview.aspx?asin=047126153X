                <span id="Label1">"No athlete performed at a higher level through greater stress than Jackie Robinson."<BR>    &#150;Scott Simon    <P>The integration of baseball in 1947 had undeniable significance for the civil rights movement and American history.  Thanks to Jackie Robinson, a barrier that had once been believed to be permanent was shattered&#150;paving the way for scores of African Americans who wanted nothing more than to be granted the same rights as any other human being.    <P>In Jackie Robinson and the Integration of Baseball, renowned broadcaster Scott Simon reveals how Robinson&#146;s heroism, firmly planted in the memory of Americans, brought the country face-to-face with the question of racial equality.  From his days in the army to his ascent to the major leagues, Robinson battled bigotry at every turn.  Simon deftly traces the journey of the rookie who became Rookie of the Year, recalling the taunts and threats, the stolen bases and the slides to home plate, the trials and triumphs.  Robinson&#146;s number, 42, is now retired on every club in major league baseball&#150;in homage to the man who had to hang his first Brooklyn Dodgers uniform on a hook rather than in a locker.    <P>TURNING POINTS features preeminent writers offering fresh, personal perspectives on the defining events of our time.    </span>

                    <span>This little book--small in dimensions and hardly over 100 pages in length--should be on everyone's bookshelf.  Whether you remember watching Jackie Robinson play (as I do), or whether he's just a name from the distant past; whether you're white (as I am), or black, or any other race, creed or color; whether you're a baseball fan (like me) or someone who couldn't care less about the National Pastime, Jackie Robinson's story is for everyone.<p>The only reason I didn't give this book a 5-star rating is that there's really nothing new in it; if you already know the saga of Robinson's integration of baseball you aren't likely to learn a lot of news things about it here.  But Scott Simon writes beautifully and movingly and retells this great American story with verve and directness.  <p>I've read that there are professional baseball players today (even black players!) who barely have any idea who Robinson was or what he endured.  His story should never be forgotten and this wonderful book will help assure that Robinson's memory endures.</span>

                    <span>This book offers nothing in the way of original research or new conclusions about the integration of organized baseball; it is full of errors, special pleading, and misplaced nostalgia.  It also fails to acknowlege its debt to the superior work of others, especially Jules Tygiel (*Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and his Legacy*) and John C. Chalberg (*Rickey and Robinson: The Preacher, the Player and America's Game*). Purchase either of the latter books (or both) and give this misconceived vanity effort a pass.</span>

                    <span>This book is a perfect two-hour read for a Saturday morning after listening to the author on NPR's Saturday Morning Edition.  The reader can hear Mr. Simon's distinctive and familiar voice when reading the pages.  The book is not intended to be a comprehensive history on baseball's integration or a biography of Jackie Robinson, as noted in the opening pages.  Rather, it provides just the right amount of background on Mr. Robinson and Mr. Richey, as well as the context surrounding events.  Mr. Simon's notes and examples stimulate readers to learn more about particular people and events.  I particularly recommend this book (and possibly the series from the list of forthcoming books) as a quick read for adults and teenagers who desire to read about the people and events that shaped our nation, yet must balance the responsibilities of family, work and community, which may prevent them from reading longer books.</span>

                    <span>This is the second book I've read in the series (after Columbus in the Americas by William Least Heat-Moon). They are both vivid, concise accounts of extraordinary moments.  I came to this book without knowing much about Jackie Robinson.  I couldn't put the book down. It's a remarkable story and so beautifully written.  I highly recommend it and look forward to others in the Turning Point series.  It's a wonderful idea, to get great authors to offer their insights about a particular historic event in a pocket size book.</span>

                    <span>In the annals of baseball history, Jackie Robinson stands among the true greats of the game.  He was that rare ballplayer who excelled at hitting, fielding, and baserunning (stealing home became his 'signature' baserunning move).  But Jackie Robinson was more than a great ballplayer; he was a pioneer.  He endured overwhelming racism and even death threats, and became an icon for the civil rights movement along the way.  Simon vividly describes the tense atmosphere of Robinson's first games in the majors, and describes how some of Robinson's own teammates were afraid to stand next to him for fear of gunshots.  The author has written an insightful and enjoyable account of Robinson's breakthrough into the major leagues. Definitely recommended.</span>
