                <span id="Label1">War is hell, but if you prepare properly for war, there's not much about life that will take you by surprise. At least, that's the premise of <I>Unleashing the Warrior Within</I>, in which author Richard Machowicz takes the lessons he learned as a Navy SEAL and applies them to real-life situations.<p> For example, in war you learn that there are three dynamic elements of combat: target, weapons, and movement. The target dictates the weapons, and the weapons dictate movement. In real life, your target is what you want; your weapons are your skills; and movement is whatever you need to get in position to use your skills.<p> But, since deciding upon a target is the step that's most troubling to people, he adds another wartime analytical tool called the CARVER matrix.  You lay out various targets you may have in life--a better job; getting in shape; buying a new house; and taking on a new business partner, say. Then you assess the criticality, accessibility, recognizability, and vulnerability of the target, plus its effect on your overall mission in life, and the potential return on your effort.  <p> Machowicz calls his philosophy <I>Bukido</I>, and when you take his classes in Los Angeles, you learn self-defense along with these life-improvement skills. In this book, the object is to get you to choose a mission that is closest and most important to you, and then achieve your goals with military precision. By the time you're through learning the seven principles of combat, what you've really learned is how to think critically and focus your efforts. Machowicz uses his students as examples of how the enemy in life is really a lack of action, allowing life to take you along for a ride. So if your current target is a solid self-improvement course, <I>Unleashing the Warrior Within</I> could be your most effective weapon. <I>--Lou Schuler</I> </span>

                    <span>While the material for this book has been gleaned from the author's years of intense military training, the lessons that he has taken away are equally applicable in daily life and don't have a militant tone to them.  Machowicz understands that we aren't all Navy Seals but that all of us can use help making ourselves more effective in day-to-day life.  This book accomplishes exactly that.  Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for more out of life and is willing to exert some energy to get it.</span>

                    <span>The author says that SEALs comb the earth for the best training available. I guess, this is true, because the book is filled with powerful ideas adopted from different fields and tested under extreme stress of life-threatening situations.
<br />
<br />First, you have several ideas from NLP. ACTE model is almost a copy of NLP's T.O.T.E. model. Fear Crusher has NLP's Belief Change Pattern underlying it. And verbal-influence conditioning is called "limiting beliefs" in NLP.
<br />
<br />Another interesting application comes from yoga. Consider the description of the author's experience at the sniper school in the context of yoga's ideas of focus, awareness and being in the present moment.
<br />
<br />So, I guess, this book is powerful because it is based on powerful ideas. And those are described clearly, using real life examples. 
<br />
<br />Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>While this book promises to help you "develop the focus, discipline, confidence and courage you need to achieve unlimited goals", perhaps its greatest gift to readers is the road map to conquering the biggest obstacle of all -- fear.
<br />
<br />Ten-year veteran Navy SEAL Richard Machowicz uses a number of tools from his recent military career to help everyone -- and I mean everyone -- prioritize, organize and attack the most crucial and important parts of your life.
<br />
<br />The writing style the author and his editor picked is perfect.  It's straightforward and to the point in a conversational way.  And that is another strength of this book, Machowicz talks to you as if you're sharing a beer together.  He offers his thoughts, his foibles and his small victories along his way to become part of a highly coveted team in the world's most advanced military.  The tales he shares about BUD/S and how he learned some of the lessons he shares in this book are a good hook to illustrate what he is talking about.  I'm particularly intrigued that he is a relatively recent SEAL, so the stories and points are relevant to us now -- instead of rehashed stories about WWII or Vietnam.
<br />
<br />For those who have previous experience, acronyms and organizational models like CARVER will be familiar.   For others, he offers simple tools that continually help you focus on what's important and then how to attack the problem.
<br />
<br />Despite the obvious military references and stories, a large portion of the real-life examples he uses come from his students -- people who are engaged in the kind of civilian jobs, families and problems that most can identify with.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the best gauge of the readability of this book is it's perceived length -- it seemed too short!   Although it comes in at 186 pages, you sense that Machowicz easily has more information to share and you're left thirsting for more.</span>

                    <span>I would give this book a 4 instead of a 5. This book has some great ideas for stress but about the 3/4 through the book things get a little bit slow (the author could probably work on this part). But overall this book is great, the author who is an ex navy seal obviously has had his fill of stress/fear has overcome it and thought about it retrospectively.
<br />       The author has a few great original ideas for overcoming fear. In one instance he calls fear a "paper thin curtain" impossible to see through but once you are through it's retrospectively not a big deal. Thus he points out that fear isn't a big deal, but if we do not face our fears (breaking up, finding a new job) we will be stuck in a stale, better than nothing life. One of the most interesting fears he points out is the fear of looking stupid (there truly is no such thing as a stupid question).
<br />     There are other great ideas like making yourself just do it (i.e. if you are faced with a tough decision with time constraints just arbitrarily take one path, or else you'll become like a deer in road looking at the headlights coming. Another interesting idea an one of the best for me, is that the way we talk to ourselves becomes a form of conditioning. Thereby to attain confidence you have to talk to yourself in a more positive (what are the opportunities in this situation) and less self degrading manner.
<br />There is alot of great stuff in this book and it deserves not just being read once but a couple of times to absorb all good advice.</span>

                    <span>   Proven Principles taught by a S.E.A.L. You're either moving towards knocking down targets or you're not. Machowics teaches you the techniques that he used to survive in combat. These same principles are put into context in our everyday lives. There is NO EGO involved in this book. The guy just lays down the cold hard facts. He teaches you how to access your environment, whether it be a jungle or the boardroom, to weigh and make important decisions, and how to use the best tools (weapons)you have available to you. Simple truths are taught, and it really makes sense to the reader. He shows you how to stack the ADVANTAGES in your own court in order to win. A Great book that is easily read, and it drives home many important concepts. </span>
