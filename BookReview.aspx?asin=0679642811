                <span id="Label1">After the terrorist attacks of September 11,  many Americans yearned to understand why Muslim extremists felt such passionate animosity toward the Western world, particularly the United States. Since that historic attack there have been many books and discussions about this very question, but few of them offer such a readable and relevant response as this excellent offering by renowned historian Bernard Lewis (<I>What Went Wrong?</I>). For modern Westerners, Islam is an especially foreign religion and culture to understand. For instance, Westerners typically dismiss things as unimportant when using the expression "that&#146;s history." But for those raised in Muslim households, history&#151;even ancient history&#151;is just as important (if not more important) as the present. And to better understand the hostilities rooted in this history&#151;one could start with recognizing the long-standing resentment the Islamic community harbors from having its homelands torn apart and re-packaged into random political states by occupying Europeans (Westerners). Or stretch back in time to the brutality of the Crusades. Or go straight to the U.S. political meddling in the region throughout the latter 20th century.   </p> This is not a pity fest for Muslims. Lewis even-handedly explores the sources of Islamic antagonism toward the West while also explaining how a supposedly peace-worshipping religion could be so distorted by violent extremism. He notes that the American way of life&#151;especially that of fulfillment through material gain and sexual freedom&#151;is a direct threat to Islamic values (which is why night clubs&#151;places where men and women publicly touch one another&#151;are targets of bombings). But it is basic Western democracy that especially threatens Islamic extremists, notes Lewis, because within its own community more and more Muslims are coming to value the freedom that political democracy allows. For anyone wanting an intelligent and accessible primer on the Islamic-Western conflict, this is an excellent place to begin. <I>Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>This is a short book that manages to give a comprehensive treatment of its subject by focusing on the key issues. It starts with the history and definition of Islam. In Islam there is no distinction between religion and state or between clergy and laity. (Although in practice this may not be true.) Lewis points out that the Prophet Mohamed started not only a religion but also a state and his successors took the title of Caliph until 1924 when the caliphate was abolished in Turkey.<P>The book discusses Jihad, the armed struggle to spread Islam, and then reviews the historical period from the Crusades to the 20th century when Western powers arrived in the Middle East and the Arabs sought protection first from Germany and then from the Soviet Union. America had been ignored until after World War II. With the collapse of the Soviet Union the United States became the only power in the world and it was natural to become the focus of attention for Moslems and Arabs in particular.<P>Religious conservatives object to the American way of life (too materialistic, too licentious) and the term "Great Satan" means the great seducer. According to the book the big problem is American support for unpopular Arab leaders, which causes the population to transform the hatred of their rulers to hatred of the United States. Lewis points out that the 9/11 highjackers were either Saudis or Egyptians, countries that are considered friendly to the United States. There is a separate chapter devoted to Saudi Arabia and how the huge oil revenue has been used to spread Wahabism, a particularly conservative version of Islam.<P>Several statistics are provided that show that the Arab (and Moslem) countries lag behind Europe, North America, and most Asia in economic development, education, and political freedom. Many of their people see that as a failure of modernity and hope that a return to the sacred past will right the wrongs. This provides support for the fundamentalists and the more oppressive a regime is the more opportunities exist for the religious extremists, since no other form of dissent is allowed.<P>The last chapter of the book is devoted to a discussion of terrorism. While only a small minority of Moslems are terrorists and their practices deviate from mainstream Islam (killing of civilians is forbidden in Jihad) they justify their acts in the name of the religion. Lewis points out that the terrorists pose a threat not only to the United States but, eventually, also to Europe and such countries as Russia, China, and India.<P>The book illuminates the deep roots of the current problems in the Moslem world and Middle East. Lewis sees the best hope in Western support of democratic opposition against oppressive rulers.</span>

                    <span>Bernard Lewis, a Professor Emeritus in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton University, has created yet another incredibly useful and timely book from articles he wrote for the New Yorker, Foreign Affairs, the Atlantic Monthly, and other publications. <P>THE CRISIS OF ISLAM -- even more than its excellent predecessor WHAT WENT WRONG? -- is both cohesive and spot-on. All nine chapters as well as the introduction are informed by the events of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath. The final chapter, for instance, deals directly with the subject of suicide bombers, discussing the Qur'an's ban on both suicide and murder of innocent civilians, and going on to discuss the "martyrs" of Hammas and the Al-Aqsa Brigades as a form of death cult that goes against the teachings of Islam.<P>I was particularly intrigued by Lewis's reference to some remarks made by Osama bin Laden regarding the "humiliation and disgrace" Islam has suffered for over eighty years. He refers specifically to the abolition of the Caliphate by Kemal Ataturk and his followers in 1924. For the first time since the days of Muhammad, Islam was without a leader. Lewis suggests that Osama would not be averse to the role himself -- which would be roughly equivalent to making Jeffrey Dahmer the headmaster of a boys' school. <P>The chapter entitled "A Failure of Modernity" gives striking evidence of the backwardness of most Islamic nations. A 2002 United Nations report states that "the Arab World translates about 330 books annually, one-fifth of the number that Greece translates. The accumulative total of translated books since [the ninth century] is about 100,000, almost the average that Spain translates in one year." If we in the West have been accused of the oddest things at times, it is because ignorance of the West is endemic. And, I might add, dangerous.<P>In order to avoid falling into the same trap ourselves -- such as by getting all our information from "The O'Reilly Report" -- we owe it to ourselves to know why over a billion Muslims have decided that we are the Great Satan. Knowledge is more powerful than an arsenal of MOABs.</span>

                    <span>Bernard Lewis does an excellent job of tracing back several of the problems plaguing the modern Islamic world to historical developments, especially during the 20th century. One learns, for example, how several destructive ideologies developed in the West were imported in the Arab-Muslim world by much-too-eager students like Nasser in Egypt. How the ideology of the Baath party in Syria partly derives from Nazi rhetoric introduced to the country (under French mandate during World War II) when they came under the Vichy government. How Nazi-inspired anti-semitic propaganda is still alive and well in that part of the world. How the fundamentailist Wahhabis, nowadays the main sponsors and promoters of Islam around the non-islamic world, would have been "a fringe group in a marginal country" if Saudi Arabia didn't happen to have oil. And much more. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This a a very readable and concise book on the history of the middle east right up to the present. Lewis does an excellent job providing a brief history of the Muslim religion along with the conflicts with western Europe and later the United States. The main turning point with the west is the end of WWI and the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the beginning of Europeon colonization of the Arab lands. Lewis also points out how the Muslim religion is more cohesive among its people with its people less concerned about nationalism. It was interesting to note that many Arabs sympathized with the Germans with WWII because they pushed the French and English out. Lewis also covers the growth of the conservative Muslim movement that is violently opposed to western culture and he explains the role of religious leadrship . In fact, Lewis theorizes that Bin Laden may think of himself as a new religous leader of the Muslim world. This is not a deep book on the Muslim religion but it does motivate the reader to read more about their religion and culture to have a better understanding of their beliefs and its clash with western culture. A superiot primer on the Middle East.</span>
