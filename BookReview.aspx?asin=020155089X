                    <span>This book really looks at the source of procrastination, and illustrates that this behavior can be overcome. It caters to the self-esteem, and gives encouraging support for dealing with procrastination once and for all. It explains how to with it yourself, as well as how to manage others who procrastinate. It also demonstrates the devestating effects of procrastination on a persons life.<BR>I thought it was very easy to read, except one part where you finally get too anxious and have to skip ahead. I suggest fighting the urge to skip Part 1, because it's true that the techniques in Part 2 aren't sufficient without understanding why you procrastinate.</span>

                    <span>Reading this book was like reading a book about myself. I've procrastinated a little more than average throughout my life, but since I started college, I've procrastinated A LOT...so much that it's often gotten in the way of my studies. So I found this book at my school's library and read it (and then bought it). Now I understand why I procrastinate and I know several good techniques how to stop..and I've improved..but I'm not free yet. It's no joke: I continue having serious troubles quitting my procrastination habits when I'm in school. Well, I have a two-step piece of advice for you if you suffer from procrastination: (1) buy the book (it's really cheap) and (2) overcome procrastination WITH ACTION. ACTION is the ONLY way you will ever break free.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book YEARS ago, maybe as many as ten years ago. Ironically enough, it took me three years to finally read it! Really. But I'm glad I finally read it. It helped me understand why I procrastinate, and provided some useful strategies to overcome it. I became a better student, worker, friend and family communicator. I've recommended it to lots of folks. In fact, I was just looking to buy a copy for a friend of mine and thought I'd take the opportunity to further spread the word about this wonderful book.</span>

                    <span>I'm a clinical psychologist, university professor and professional coach who helps people combat procrastination and writer's block. This is the first book I recommend to clients and students who want to reform self-defeating habits of procrastination.<BR>Burka and Yuen present sophisticated explanations of the many reasons why we habitually delay important but unpleasant activities. Then, in the second half of the book, they provide tips and tactics to help us overcome procrastination.<P>The book is well-written, and provides clear and compelling examples. <BR>When I first read this book more than a decade ago, it helped me get my own dissertation done. I'm delighted that it is still in print.</span>

                    <span>I finally finished this book after putting it off several times, and I'm a terrible procrastinator. I think it is helpful to learn why we procrastinate in order to understand these behaviors and then change them. I recognized myself in so many of the sample situations desribed and the explanations behind such actions.<P>The second part contains a lot of helpful techniques, such as breaking a big project into more manageable chunks, or deciding to work on one chapter of a book at a time that needs to be finished.<P>I really have to reread the second part though (What to Do About [Procrastination]) because I unfortunately haven't changed my habits yet. (In fact, I should be working right now but I'm writing this review.) So until then I can't really say if it helps or not, but Part one was eye opening to me. I also appreciate that the book was written by two die-hard procrastinators who were able to overcome the habit.</span>
