                <span id="Label1"><i>Practical Python</i> offers a highly useful guide to the Python programming language. In disarmingly readable prose, author Magnus Lie Hetland guides you through those concepts of most importance to the budding Python developer.</p>  <p> Following a succinct overview of the installation process, Hetland brings you up to speed regarding the general programming precepts common to every high-level language, including datatypes, conditionals and looping, abstractions, and modularity. Notably, Hetland takes great care to provide a thorough introduction to Python's potentially confusing datatype offering, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries, providing numerous examples aimed toward familiarizing you with their subtle, yet important differences.</p>  <p>Primed with the language's foundational knowledge, you&#146;ll then be introduced to Python&#146;s file-handling, database, GUI, and string-handling capabilities. Additionally, Hetland offers an excellent review of Python&#146;s object-oriented, functional, and exception-handling capabilities. All chapters are peppered with references to Python's useful built-in functions, which is done with the intention of demonstrating the considerable features offered by the default Python distribution.</p>  <p>Hetland devotes the second half of the book to project development, taking great care to choose a series of ten increasingly complex applications that are of timely and wide-ranging interest to burgeoning and expert developers alike. Project focus includes automated document conversion, newsgroup administration, graphical PDF document generation, remote document maintenance, the creation of a peer-to-peer system with XML-RPC, database integration, and GUI and game development. </p></span>

                    <span>I am currently working on a project which involves a software tool for energy benchmarking. Up until now I have been using an interpreted language (which will go unmentioned, I don't want to start a flame war). Although this language is good for a lot of things, it was becoming increasingly difficult to use it for my project. I felt that the project was getting too big to maintain the code in a orderly way. For a while I have trying to port the whole shebang to C++, but it felt like trying to kill a mosquito with a cannon (like in that Monty Python sketch). My search on the wonderful worldwide web confirmed what I already knew, I should try to use Python for my project (read 'why Python' by Eric Raymond for instance). After dabbling around with tutorials and the like I thought it was time to buy a real book. I came across 'Practical Python' by Magnus Lie Hetland pretty soon and downloaded a sample chapter. After reading this I just knew this was the book for me. It's well written, it has good examples and is written with humour. Humour, I think at least, is important but very personal and Hetland manages to find a good balance between humour and 'serious' coding. The examples are clear and especially noteworthy are the projects which are in the last part of the book. This is practical! Once you mastered the language you can use your knowledge in real applications. The book reads like a Stephen King novel. Exciting, you want to know what's on the next page before you go to sleep (if you can sleep...).<BR>Overall this book is a winner. I would like to recommend it to everyone who wants to learn Python and have a nice time reading it also. I know that I did!</span>

                    <span>I'm really starting to wonder about these whole Amazon review system. I mean, these reviews so far reflect nothing about what I've personally found this book to be. All of those things sound strikingly like advertisements as opposed to honest feedback. I doubt this Amazon thing is worth anything anymore, but whatever. This book was dry, drab and incomplete in many ways. It never delivered what it promised. I can't say I'm a beginner at Python, so perhaps that was the problem. But I'd stay away from this book and perhaps look at one of Oreillys titles.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I went through the author's online tutorials at his website (www.hetland.org). I enjoyed his writing style there and thought the book should be good as well. The book is even better than I had imagined an introductory programming text could be. I have been dabbling with learning Python for a while now, so the basics of the language and of programming in general were known to me. This book helped expand that basic knowledge quite a bit. It really brings together what I had read in other beginning-level books, and even explains some things that the others neglect to.<P>If you have little to no programming experience, this book can help you. If you are an experienced programmer in another language, this book can help you. If you already know Python, this book can still teach you a few things. And true to the Python culture, it is a good read with humor injected throughout.</span>

                    <span>I'm new to programming (except for BASIC 15 years ago!) and thought I'd start with Python, since it's reputed to be both powerful AND fairly easy. To get started, I went through all the online tutorials I could find, and bought The Python Bible and Quick Python, both of which were slightly beyond my grasp.<P>I bought this book in order to learn some basic XML handling in Python and got SO MUCH MORE! This is how all computer books should be. It's increadibly readable, with new terms and concepts explained thoroughly (and with good, RELEVANT EXAMPLES!). The projects aren't exactly what I need, but illustrate the concepts well and are fun to play with. <P>Overall, I can't recommend this enough. I've never been so happy with a technical book, and I sincerely hope Mr. Hetland has more on the way.</span>
