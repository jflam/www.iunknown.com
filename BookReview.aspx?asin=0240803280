                    <span>Absolutly easy to understand and read. Very well presented, and may well be the only book on Zone System you will ever need. For those wanting to delve into the chemistry of exposure, pass on this book. If you want to learn what the Zone system is and how it works, this book is great.

                    <span>This is one of the easier books to understand on the zone system.  It does not get too tied up in the details of the system but describes enough detail to allow the reader to understand the basics of the system.  This book is really targeted to someone who is not familiar with the zone system or who has studied it in more complex books and did not really comprehend the system.  For this intended audience the book is right on target.  It takes the complex issues of the zone system and removes the calculations and just gives you what you need to know.  Think of it like the difference between an art teacher who says "Color the grass green" versus one who says "The grass must be green because chlorophyll absorbs the green portion of the light spectrum and so reflected light appears that color".  If you just want to know how to use the system without a lot of detail behind why the system works then this is a good book selection for you.</span>

                    <span>Of the several books I have on Zone, this is by far the best and most easily understood.  It's to the point, and has great examples, especially explaining the effects of development time.</span>

                    <span>I have found this book, The Pratical Zone System, by Chris Johnson to be the best book that I have read on the Zone System.  It explains every detail of the Zone System. Some of the other readings that I have read on the subject make it a complicated system. Mr Chris Johnson's book is very easy to comprehend and it is very interesting. It also makes a great reference manual. Most important is that using  the methods in the book you will get the the best results possible creating a photograph. <p>Anyone that is planing on using the zone system or is having trouble understanding the zone system will have all the problems resolved with this book.

                    <span>This book is an excellent introduction to the Zone System. If you are looking to learn about the Zone System, it is hard to go wrong with this book. However, if you are somewhat familiar with the Zone System and are  looking for more advanced info, this may not be the book for you. I had  read Ansel Adam's book "The Negative" (which is an excellent book  if you are looking for a bit more technical and in depth study) before this  book so I felt that the book was a little simple. However, the thing I love  about this book are the appendixes Chris includes. In them are a wealth of  info for developing times for many developers and films, as well and a  plethora of additional useful information. I also found the two testing  methods Chris provided to be extremely accurate and useful. In summary,  this is an excellent introductory book on the Zone System, and intermediate  users will find the appendixes extremely useful. However, if you consider  yourself an expert in the Zone System, I would not recommend this book.  However, if you consider yourself an expert, you probably won't be looking  for a book anyway.</span>
