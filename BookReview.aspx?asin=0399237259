                    <span>I will say nothing against Jaques, because his books provided me with an exciting and worthwhile escape from the everyday world during my childhood. My regret is that, now I'm an adult, I can't help but notice his shallow characters, irritating songs, predictable plotlines and unthreatening villains. I wish I could stop noticing these things, but I can't. 
<br />...In any case I'm now a writer, and writing books which are rather Jaques-like in that they're about battles fought by animal characters, but which are for an older audience. If anyone wants to read them, they're available free on this website:
<br />
<br />www.kjtaylor.com
<br />
<br />I only have two warnings to make: These stories are not for little kids, and they won't be free of charge forever. Read them while you've got the opportunity, you've got nothing to lose.</span>

                    <span>I will shock many reviewers and readers of these books to state that I am over 50, and still enjoying the stories as much as ever.  I am confused by several of the reviewers who find this "much the same" - of course.  What would one expect to find in a "Redwall" series book than resourceful, brave, small peace-loving critters facing immense odds of evil beasts?  This is exactly why one reads the Redwall books - to discover again how the master tale-teller Jacques has woven new characters around the perennial themes of good and evil, friendship and loyalty vs fear and slavery.  While true none of the main characters is a casualty in this story, many good creatures die in the course of the tale, and we see several give their lives for their friends - the colonel and the corporal, in different battles.
<br />I started reading Redwall to my children 12 years ago, and have continued to collect all of the books by Brian Jacques, enjoying them mostly myself, although a strong advocate when asked for a reference.  I would highly recommend them to "kids" of all ages - only cautioning that the language will stretch younger vocabularies (especially in the earlier books), and that these are not "gentle" books where no one dies.  Rose and many others do not survive, and the realism presented in the stories adds greatly to the impact of the books.
<br />If one wants to read about other characters and stories, there are many out there.  If you want strong characters, challenging reading, themes of bravery and self-sacrifice, and descriptions of feasting that makes me hungry to write about, these are the best around.  Enjoy!</span>

<br />	Have you ever read a book that you never want to finish? Well, I have. Brian Jacques masterpiece Rakkety Tam captured me with its suspense, adventure, and captivating description. Gulo the Savage wants to take over The Northern Sea, but first he has to find the Walking Stone which his cowardly brother stole. Meanwhile, Rakkety Tam and his companion, Doogy Plumm, are on a mission to find a flag for the squirrel queen. They end up at Redwall. Gulo and his crew hear about Redwall and are after its riches. Will the peaceful Redwall critters, with the help of Salamandastron hares, and Rakkety Tam, and Doogy, keep Redwall and defeat Gulo the Savage? They faced many problems throughout their journey to defeat Gulo. First, Rakkety Tam leads Gulo into the Pines where the blackbirds are. The blackbirds killed or injured many critters on each side. Then they went barreling down a fast-flowing river on a log and turned just before falling off a waterfall. Gulo couldn't stop so he went over with some of his band. Throughout the book Rakkety Tam learned how to be a better warrior, companion, and friend.  In my opinion the author's message is that by helping others you'll help yourself, and accomplish many things. So, I rate this five stars because of its suspense, adventure, and amazing description. If you ever read this book you'll agree with me that this book is truly enthralling.
