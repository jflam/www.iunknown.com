                    <span>This is a great book for businesses looking for unique opportunities to both make a difference and raise their community standing.  It is comprised of real, powerful examples of how these partnerships can and do work.  This book should be read along with Bill Shore's, "The Cathedral Within."</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Every company I know is interested in getting and providing a great deal.   Every nonprofit I know is committed to the greater welfare of the society.   But almost no companies and nonprofits know how to link together to  multiply their effectiveness in achieving their purposes.  <p>This book  provides outstanding examples and a superb template for creating  partnerships of great value for all involved:  companies, their employees,  nonprofits, and the communities that everyone serves.  Based on the  examples in this book, it looks like the benefits can easily be 20 to 1 in  the near term from the time and money invested.  That kind of return is  hard to find in business, philanthropy, or social entrepreneurship.  The  reason it happens is that the company can add value that the nonprofit  cannot, and vice versa.  The strategic partnership is not unlike the  strategic alliances that companies create all the time with comapnies that  offer unique strategic capabilities.<p>The reason these benefit are so  large (and growing) is because customers and employees are ever more  responsive to promoting a social cause, companies are getting better at  partnering with outside organizations, and the expertise of nonprofits is  growing.   <p>Businesses can gain by getting low-cost recognition from  customers that will increase sales, obtaining low-cost resources, making  work more meaningful to employees (helping to retain them), attracting  employees more easily, and learning how cause-based leadership can  transform an organization.  When you look at it from a dollar and cents  point of view, these partnerships would pass any accounting test you want  to use.  Not to seek out these partnerships is to waste potential for  growth and profits in your company.  Corporate boards should be asking  company CEOs to develop these partnerships!<p>Nonprofits can gain by  learning how to increase outcomes they care about, gaining access to  resources that would otherwise be unavailable, getting more exposure, and  finding improved ways of meeting their missions.<p>Communities will gain by  getting more resources, expertise, and attention from social entrepreneurs  in companies and nonprofits.  <p>So this is a win-win-win world, but  somebody has to get it going.  Chapter ten is excellent on that subject:   It proposes a 5 step model for the nonprofit -- self assess, identify a  partner, connect to that partner, test the relationship idea, and grow the  relationship.  <p>Although the initiative can come from the company, it  usually won't. The executives already have other agendas, are receiving  hundreds of requests for assistance, and don't know what many nonprofits  can do for them.  You can add some corporate executives to your nonprofit  board who will understand companies to help you make these connections.   The biggest hurdle will be the lack of corporate experience of your  nonprofit's staff.  Nonprofits are used to looking for a check, not a  partnership.  But that reliance on gifts alone is stalled thinking that  will hold back the development of the public good.<p>The case histories  include Home Depot and KaBOOM! (building playgrounds), Microsoft and the  American Library Association (adding computers and Internet services to  libraries in low-income areas), Denny's and Save the Children (raising  money for poor children), BankBoston and City Year (sponsoring volunteers  in community work), Ridgeview, Inc. and Newton-Conover Public Schools  (creating better public schools and better parent involvement from  employees with children), and Boeing and Pioneer Human Services (creating  airplane parts by employing those with disadvantaged backgrounds).  I found  all of them to be interesting and well analyzed.  Each one gave me ideas  for how to pursue opportunties like these for the nonprofit on whose board  I serve.  <p>I especially recommend this book to company leaders, human  resource executives, purchasing managers, and marketing planners.  On the  nonprofit side, this book will be a revelation to staffs and board  members.<p>After you have read this book, please join the board of a  nonprofit (if you are not already on one).  Then, please use the processes  in this book to create a strategic partnership with your company or another  one in your community.  You will gain strategic partnering skills and a  sense of a job well done.  The others will gain the benefits described  above.  If we each did this, our communities would soon be far more  wonderful places to live and work.<p></span>

Corporate executives will benefit greatly from the book's clear and cogent lessons on the  benefits of corporate/social sector partnership.  This book is proof that  goodness can endure.</span>

                    <span>I'd strongly recommend this book both to corporate executives looking to improve corporate image and morale and to non-profit leaders seeking new funding mechanisms.  Although the hokey title evokes past clichés like  "doing good by doing well," the book is actually a practical,  hard-headed approach to making companies run better by working with  non-profits -- either through straight philanthropy, employee volunteer  efforts, or joint ventures.</span>

                    <span>As a former corporate executive and a former member of the boards of directors of several non-profits, I can only wish this book could have been available years ago. Just think what I could have accomplished!  I  certainly recommend it for people in similar positions now. <p>In contrast  to so many business oriented books, this one is engagingly written and  eminently readable</span>
