                <span id="Label1">Aimed at aspiring C# programmers of all levels, legendary Windows expert Charles Petzold's <I>Programming Windows with C#</I> provides an extremely in-depth and intelligent tutorial to the APIs underpinning Microsoft's .NET Framework.<p>For a generation of programmers, Petzold's <I>Programming Windows: The Definitive Guide to the Win32 API</I> provided a virtual bible on how to get started with Windows development. This massive, handsomely bound hardcover edition attempts the same breadth of coverage for Microsoft's new C# language and the new .NET. With several examples clearly inspired by the earlier C title, this book demonstrates the author's keen eye for showing off and explaining the capabilities of low-level APIs to good effect.<p>The book first outlines basic "Hello World" examples for both a console and Windows Forms. Next, there's coverage of basic support classes (like points and rectangles) before turning toward using these structures in extensive sections on graphics programming. Petzold's traditional strengths as a computer author are in ample evidence here, with many short examples that exercise the capabilities of the new .NET APIs.<p>Veteran readers will recognize the basic shape of the early Win32 title in the organization of this (completely rewritten) C# version in the flow of topics from graphics, keyboard, mouse and timers, and the like. (One production note here is that the order of later chapters does jump around somewhat, circling back to graphics topics several times instead of presenting related APIs in order.)<p>The sections on graphics transforms and how to manipulate images are worthy of note. There's excellent coverage of the possibilities of working with text and fonts output in .NET. Nifty working samples for several types of clocks and shape-drawing demos will let you explore graphical APIs in detail.<p>Several chapters cover basic Windows Forms control programming with buttons, labels, and edit controls and then splitters, ListView, and TreeView controls. This volume closes out with references to files and streams, and math and string APIs. For any developer who wants to create state-of-the-art, "traditional" client-side software, this book is sure to be required reading for its in-depth look at graphics and other leading-edge .NET features. It proves once again that learning low-level APIs in detail is still a good way to learn Windows programming. <I>--Richard Dragan</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Overview of C# and .NET Windows programming fundamentals; a "Hello World" console application; C# language and object basics; a simple Windows Forms application (creating a main window and handling the paint events); basic .NET structures (including rectangles, points, and colors); text output and scrolling; exploring .NET system information; in-depth tutorial for GDI+ programming: pens, lines, rectangles, and polygons; keyboard processing (plus a custom class for caret processing); graphics transformations (including scaling, linear transforms with matrices); mouse processing (plus processing the mouse wheel); text and fonts (TrueType and OpenType fonts, antialiasing, measuring text); using timers; date and time APIs; a sample code for clocks; drawing and transforming images (displaying JPG and BMP files); simple animation; basic control programming (buttons, labels, scroll bars, and track bars); exploring Bezier curves and splines; menus (basic and custom); graphics paths and regions; clipping techniques; basic dialog box programming (modal and modeless forms); edit, list, and spin controls; font transforms and special effects, using toolbars and status bars, printing techniques (including print dialogs), splitter, TreeView, and ListView controls; programming with the clipboard, drag-and-drop support, reference sections on APIs for programming with files and streams, math functions, and strings.</span>

                    <span>This book provides a good, short introduction to C#.  It was my first book on C#, and I did not feel like I needed another after reading it.
<br />
<br />After those couple of chapters, it provides rather wordy coverage of Windows Forms and drawing graphics with .Net.  The title should reflect this more clearly, in my opinion.  The book does not talk about programming Windows in general (assemblies, threading, XML, etc.); it focuses solely on the graphical aspects, with some brief look at file I/O.
<br />
<br />The coverage of Windows Forms and drawing is great, if a somewhat verbose.</span>

                    <span>I'm not sure why I've seen so many good reviews for this book.......I see it as 1200+ pages of wasted paper.  Microsoft recommends this book as study material for their exam? Rest assured..... this book doesn't cover anything but drawing pretty little circles, lines, text, and who could forget the cute little spiral, lol!  This book contains a lot of useless information regarding the many, let me emphasize that MANYMANYMANY ways of drawing shapes.<br>Unless you plan on writing applications that produce arrays of wonderful shapes on your screen, this book is not for you!  Take the time to head down to your local book store and review the content before wasting your money.</span>

                    <span>If you carefully examine the list of "Topics Covered" given by Amazon, you will not be disappointed at how Petzold does it.  No one covers what Petzold chooses to write about more thoroughly and clearly than Petzold.  The book definitely assumes familiarity with a C-family language.  What is absent is information that his previous "Programming Windows" books gave about the underlying Windows environment, and about interprocess communication.  I suppose this is because you can simply link to other code without much work in the new framework.  But he does not cover the structure of .NET; the word "Assembly" is not even in his reliable comprehensive index, nor is "Component" or "IComponent."  Disposal of resources is only mentioned with regard to graphics objects.  The book covers Windows Forms programming, very well, and that's all it is meant for.  By all means get this book, but get other books for other purposes.</span>

                    <span>While most C# books tend to focus on :<br>- basic C#<br>- XML<br>- ASP.NET<br>"Programming Windows with C# " simply teaches you all you should know about GUI programming with C#. It looks obvious, but try to find good references in this subject and you'd be disappointed.<br>Not most programmers can afford Visual Studio NET and also not all programmers want RAD tools. Actually what is great with C# is that it allows the programmer to do everything manually and avoid automatic code geration. While it could delay your work, it certainly make it clear. The Forms API for C# is considerably simpler compared to MFC or WIN32 API Programming. Java programmers like me will find it usefull because its similarities with the Swing API. <br>The author is an excellent technical writer and make everything easy to read. And like he said "I prefer to type the code by hand and then I will learn it".<br>If you aim to write Windows GUIs for C#, get this book. It is a complete reference in the subject. The author does not mention it, but there is an open source and free IDE for .NET development name Sharp Develop. I use it and so far I haven't gotten many troubles.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I spent most of the time on Visual Basic but I consider this text the appropriate companion for Balena's book. This book explain wery well GDI+ and structure of windows forms and it is full of valuable information. It is true that all of this info are also contained in the MSDN collection but here all is well organized and written in a clear language. This book is not intended to learn C#, and maybe more appropriate title would be "Programming Windows with Windows.Forms". If you also know Visual Basic or the fundamental of OOP and want to begin to program .NET with C# this is the book for you. But if you lack good knowledge of OOP and want to learn C# language instead buy another book. Remember that in this book the syntax of C# is not covered in details.</span>
