                <span id="Label1">As baseball legend Ted Williams lay dying in Florida, his old Boston Red Sox teammates Johnny Pesky and Dom DiMaggio piled into a car and drove 1,300 miles to see their friend. Another member of the close-knit group, Bobby Doerr, remained in Oregon to tend to his wife who had suffered a stroke. Besides providing a poignant travelogue of the elderly Pesky and DiMaggio's trip, David Halberstam's <I>The Teammates</I> goes back in time to profile the men as young ballplayers. Although it is enlightening to learn about Doerr, Pesky, and DiMaggio, the leader of the group and star of the book is Williams. Halberstam portrays the notoriously moody and difficult Williams as a complex man: driven by a rough childhood and a fiercely competitive nature to become perhaps the greatest pure hitter of all time while also being a magnetic personality and loving friend. While there is nothing exceptionally unusual about old men who have stayed friends (plenty of people stay friends, after all), baseball gives this particular relationship a unique makeup. Unlike most friendships, that of Williams, Doerr, Pesky, and DiMaggio was viewed all summer long by hooting, hollering Red Sox fans. As such, their bond is forged both of individual accomplishment, win-loss records, numerous road trips, and, since they played for the Red Sox, annual doses of disappointment. Halberstam, author of <I>Summer of '49</I> and <I>October 1964</I> is the ideal writer to tell two equally intriguing stories, both rich in America's pastime. Although he occasionally drops himself into the narrative, one expects that of Halberstam and gladly accepts it in exchange for the highly readable exposition infused with poetic majesty that has become his trademark. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>It's easy to look at baseball today and grimace. Steroid scandals, multi-million dollar contracts, free agency, etc. have watered down the true National past time that we all hold so dear. Of course, reading this book, the Teammates, will take you back to a time and place that no longer exists. A time when baseball really mattered.
<br />
<br />But more than that, this is a book about the power of friendship. The book chronicles the life-long friendship of four Boston greats - Williams, Pesky, DiMaggio and Doerr.
<br />
<br />Shortly before the death of the Spelndid Splinter, Pesky and DiMaggio head south (Doerr was too ill to make the trip) and begin a journey - not just to Florida to be by their teammate's side one last time, but also a journey back in time - the golden era of baseball. The reader then becomes privy to a world of stories about the four friends. Halberstam is our vehicle through a joyous and memorable ride through history. They say the Boston Red Sox are more than a baseball team. They say the Sox help link us to our past, and in some way I think they do. 
<br />
<br />This book is one to hold on to and pass down. </span>

                    <span>Thank you to Brian for his review. I read the book all the way through on 10/29/04. One of the many things I said, shouted, and hollered on 10/27/04 was "Omigosh, all my Red Sox books are out of date." And it's true, but how wonderful to know that 3 of these 4 men got to see this World Series, at least on this plane. This is a wonderful book and certainly still relevant. I hope this book will finally put to rest the criticism of Johnny Pesky. I'm convinced.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As a fan of Halberstam's 'Summer of '49', I picked up this book and put it on the shelf.  As the Red Sox clinched their division series this year (2004), I decided it time to dust off the cover.  The book makes for a very quick read (barely 200 pages).  That said, the story is beautifully drawn from a lifelong friendship between Johnny Pesky, Dom Dimaggio, Bobby Doerr and Ted Williams. Playing nearly their entire careers for the BoSox exclusively, they grew to love and admire each other, bicker about everything from politics to hitting, but in the end be there for each other when it counted.  
<br />
<br />The story tells of Pesky and Dimaggio as they make the drive from Boston to Florida to see a dying Ted Williams in October of 2001.  To say this book is a "Feel-good" book would be an understatement.  Halberstam sees baseball as a passion, not just a game and he finds a way of expressing that through writing.  Not critical of character flaws, he almost glorifies Williams' violent temper.  Readers of Halberstam though aren't looking for a critical analysis, rather a glorification of baseball's glory days.
<br />
<br />To baseball purists like myself, the lack of the critical was not missed in the least.  
<br />
<br />This book couldn't be timed more perfectly as tonight as I write this, they are measuring an 85-year-old Johnny Pesky for his MUCH deserved World Series ring.  Finishing this book the night the Red Sox clinched the AL pennant against the Yankees and seeing Pesky announced as a coach on the field in Fenway two nights later brought tears to the eyes.  Surely no one is happier about the Red Sox 2004 World Series Championship than Pesky and his friends Dimaggio, Doerr and somewhere Upstairs, Ted Williams.</span>

                    <span>Ted Williams, John Pesky, Dom Dimaggio, and Bobby Doerr couldn't be more different and their life long friendship is amazing. They were born 19 months apart and spent most of their lives/entire baseball careers together. They remained friends together and helped each other since their minor league days. This book recounts their history and the trip that Dimaggio and Pesky took in late 2002 to go see Ted Williams in Florida, shortly before he died.</span>
