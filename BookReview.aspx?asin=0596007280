                    <span>Excel Annoyances ...
<br />
<br />This book is made for those who have had one or more vexing problems with Excel. If that's you, the answer can probably be found here and lots more besides.
<br />
<br />Curtis Frye is an established author, including several books on Excel. He has the book divided into chapters that deal with several categories of problems: Entering Data, Formatting, Formulas, Manipulating Data, Charts, Exchanging Data, Printing, and Customization.
<br />
<br />His solutions vary from basic training on how to use a feature, to how to tweak things "just so." Each Annoyance is the result of someone's problem with an aspect of Excel. Since many people do not upgrade to the latest version of Excel when it's available, the book covers solutions from Excel 97 through the current Excel 2003.
<br />
<br />One of the most interesting things I learned was the existence of a function that translated numbers into Roman numerals! I never knew this existed. That's not to say I would ever have any use for such a function, but it was interesting playing around with it. If you want to try it out, type a number in one cell and in another, type this formula: = roman(cell), where "cell" is the location of the number you typed. You'll see the result in roman numbers, as advertised. Slick! Someone once threatened to file his income tax return using roman numbers, just to make things hard for IRS, and this is a way it could be done. IRS would probably object.
<br />
<br />Screen shots are used liberally in the book. These may simply be a shot of a worksheet but often a related dialog box is also shown. Occasionally a text box includes extra information that may be of importance for a subject.
<br />
<br />One extra feature include in the book is reference to some time-wasters, also known as games. Each is an Excel version and is free to download. There's Pac Man, Arkanoid, BlackJack, Rubik's Cube, Tetris and more.
<br />
<br />There are occasional answers using Visual Basic, but for the most part, the answers simply use the settings that are already in Excel. Most users never tap the full potential of Excel, and I'm no exception. I feel I am an expert, but I certainly learned a lot by reading this book and you will too, if you use Excel at all.

                    <span>At last, a computer book written, as I now think they all should be, by a professional comedian. This book is not written for the absolute beginner, but by someone who has used Excel enough to have a couple of annoying problems that they would like to have fixed. 
<br />
<br />The first Annoyance is "Kill Clippy." This was one of the most hated "innovations" in history. Even Microsoft eventually had the sense to turn him off in Excel 2002. But if you're running an older version, or if someone else using you're computer turns him on, here's how to get rid of him permanently. And for a joke he offers you a web site on "clippycide." That's what a computer book should be. 
<br />
<br />This goes on to nearly every aspect of working with Excel. Chapter 9 starts out: 
<br />
<br />Excel's basic functions haven't changed in years. Of course, Microsoft has to addd new stuff to give you a reason to upgrade to the latest version. In Excel 2003, that reason was support for XML." 
<br />
<br />XML is supposed to make it easy to transfer data from one program to another. Of course there are XML annoyances, one is that the XML that Access produces isn't necessarily readable by Excel. Oh Boy!</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Ok, Excel is the dominant spreadsheet. No question of that. But it has some surprising "features" which this book calls annoyances. It gives a multitude of them, with fixes for all. (Another O'Reilly series might call these fixes hacks.)
<br />
<br />Logically enough, the book starts off with those difficulties that can be met when inputting data. Many of you will applaud that the leading annoyance is the Paperclip, on which much verbal ire has no doubt been expended. So Frye forthrightly shows how to terminate this pesky little bugger.
<br />
<br />Later sections talk about formatting, formulae, charting, printing and so on. The chapters essentially follow the main functional structures of Excel. Some features might not be obvious to you; depending on your expertise. But chances are that for the average Excel user, you'll get some good advice from Frye.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a well organized and written set of useful hints and pointers for Excel. They range from solutions to difficult data analysis issues, to tips about graphing, pivot tables, and importing data from various formats, notably XML.
<br />
<br />The book is organized into chapters around central Excel themes; editing, formulas, formatting, charting, etc. Each chapter has a set of annoyances with a description and a solution. These annoyances are sometimes bugs, and sometimes just difficult issues that reasonably advanced users will run into where the help is either insufficient or poorly written. The fixes are generally fairly short and contained within the bounds of Excel, though the book does point to external sites and software where appropriate.
<br />
<br />Definitely a must have for the power Excel user.</span>
