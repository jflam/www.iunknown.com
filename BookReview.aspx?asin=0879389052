                    <span>Williamson's history of the German SS is a very readible, very comprehensive work on one of the world's most notorious organizations. His writing from a neutral stand point is a breath of fresh air -- permitting readers to draw their own conclusions on the nature of the SS and the men (and women) who filled it's ranks. The Waffen-SS, Hitler Youth, RHSA, SD, Gestapo, concentration camps, einsatzgruppen (death squads), commercial enterprises, Himmler's theories on Race and heredity ... it's all here - laid out in painstaking detail.<P>The book traces the SS from it's tiny beginnings in the 1920's, its growth in the early 30's, thru to it's final days with the collapse of Nazi Germany. Actually, Williamson goes even further back to explain the grim mood of Germany at the close of World War I and how this paved the way for the fledgling Nazi party. Many significant details of how the SS interfaced and was intertwined with organizations such as the SA, the Wehrmacht the German government (before Hitler became the absolute ruler) and the regular police are laid out for the reader's inspection. It's also quite illuminating to discover how many invaded countries supplied willing volunteers to the SS. Many fascinating facts and stories are related.<P>The book itself is durably bound in a hard cover with a handsome black paper jacket. Inside are a wealth of photos and reproduced posters - combat, personnel and civilian - complete with descriptions, which allow one to gain a closer understanding of the units and men that made up the Nazi party's protection and security arm.<P>Have an interest in pre-war and World War II Germany? If so, this is a book you will want for your collection. <P>Highly recommended<P>~P~</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. Williamson chronicles these elite soldiers from Poland to the end of the war. He gives an objective account of their truly amazing performance on the eastern front as well as their darker side. His book descibes armies as well as individual soldiers accounts. He has written about their heroic deeds and infamous acts. His liberal distribution of photos gives the reader a good ideal of all the major players involved. He has done his homework in researching these units. He describes their performance in battle and has many fascinating insights into their experiences. For example: Field Marshal Model apologizes to Regimental commander Otto Kumm that he understands the rough time his unit has experienced but can't afford to relieve them. Kumm asks the Field Marshal if he would like to inspect the regiment on parade outside. Model is shocked to see only 35 men standing out front in the cold.</span>

                    <span>Many good things can be said about this book. I sought out this book after reading the 'Complete Idiot's Guide to Nazi Germany' and found that it had very little information on the SS. I was surprised at the number of photos and pictures in this book. That was the aspect I liked the most. The overall layout of the book was nice with detailed information on the formation of the SS, day to day tasks, subdivisions of the organization, equipment, atrocities on both the Eastern and Western Fronts, and the foreign legions. However, I feel the book could have used more information on the Gestapo, the SD, and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS was given plenty of coverage in regards to its individual divisions and campaigns on the two fronts. I would have to say too much information considering that this was supposed to be a book about the entire SS. The sections on the Waffen SS were excellent, without a doubt. The book should have been given a different title which stresses this fact. Overall, the book was easy to read and flowed well with plenty of fascinating information. The author seemed a bit quick to defend the Waffen SS and some of the atrocities it is accused of, constantly stressing the fact that on the whole they were soldiers like those in the Wehrmacht. Though this may or may not have been true, opinions like this should have been kept to a minimum. The book would have been better if the information was just presented and then proceeded to let the reader decide for him or herself.</span>

                    <span>It is an extremely wonderful book. Spectacular! It is highly recommended for those interested in the SS and all of its doings. I would like to recommend Masters of Death : SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust in addition to this book.</span>

                    <span>This is by far the best book avaliable about the SS anywhere in any language. Mr.Willamson includes a great amount of detail. There are over two hundred (200) pictures. This book covers every aspect of the SS, from their origin in the 1930's to their fall in the mid '40's. There are chapters dedicated to such things as the concentration camps and race policy, to the weapons used by the SS and even the Waffen SS creed and oath of allegiance.<P>The best part, I thought, was that Mr.Williamson takes a completely objective view of the SS, allowing you to draw your own conclusions from the information he provides for you. This is great considering that ususally the SS are played out as evil without any real evidence to support it. Here you can decide for yourself. I.E. Instead of just mentioning the Waffen SS's slaughter of about 20 US P.O.W.'s he goes on to tell of how the US then tortured SS soldiers in an effort to incriminate their officers. Another instance is when a very angry Waffen SS officer orders his troops to burn a passel of French resistance soldiers. It also tells, however that the motives for this (I am NOT justifying) for his orders were his discovery of several unarmed Wermacht medics who were burned alive in their truck and their prisoners mutilated.<P>He dosen't try to justify either side's actions. Just gives you the straight facts, too bad not every political or war book does that.<P>More power to Mr.Williamson, this book is worth every penny of the cost (even shipping!)</span>
