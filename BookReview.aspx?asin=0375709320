                    <span>The $11 Verbal Advantage book has the exact same content (word-for-word) as the $299 audio program under the same title.  This program has been around for at least 12 years, and it uses an old and outdated learning model: The Verbal Advantage program contains entirely too much unnecessary information.  Save your money and buy Word Smart (the book) or Verbal Power (the audio program) if you don't want to waste two years trying to build your vocabulary.</span>

                    <span>This is a fun book for learning new words.  The words are divided in 10 levels, each level containing 50 "key" words. Each level is progressively more challenging (you may read this as - it contains the words you might have been less likely to encounter, though this depends on what do your normally read). 
<br />
<br />Beside each word, you'll find the pronounciation in brackets.  With words which may have two of more pronounciation, they are all mentioned here.
<br />
<br />The "key word" is follows with the definition, as well as the origin.  For example, if the word has a Latin root, then the Latin word is mentioned, together with the meaning of the Latin word. 
<br />
<br />Then the usage of the words is mentioned, together with different contexts in which such word may be used.  You'll find the contexts where the word was originally used, as well as how its usage spread to other contexts, sometimes altering the meaning the word originally had.
<br />
<br />You'll also find sections warning your of "abusage" of the words.  
<br />
<br />You'll find antonyms and synonyms of the "key" words, together with their definitions, usage, appropriate contexts, and distinguishing differences.
<br />
<br />Each level is followed by a reviews, sample text where you can check out your comprehension, additional notes and a quiz.
<br />
<br />At the beginning of the book is a "pretest" with 100 words, designed to help you to evaluate your current vocabulary level. At the end of the book is "posttest" with 100 words, designed to help you evaluate how much has your vocabulary expanded after working with this book.

                    <span>I would have given this book 5 stars, but was dumbfounded to realize that there is no index or alphabetical listing of all the words in the book! Each of the ten lessons covers 50 words (called keywords), plus there are hundreds of synonyms and antonyms thrown in with the discussions of each word. I think every one of these words should be indexed, so if I learn a word (or want to) I can find it. At the very least the keywords should be indexed. An egregious shortcoming in an otherwise superb book. </span>

                    <span>A previous review, Xavier, was about to buy the $300 CDs, but bought the $15 book instead.  Xavier may have saved $285, but a book, even with similar text, is not as effective as the CDs.  <p>Listening to the audio, may or may not be worth $285, but listening, not just reading the words is virtually necessary to learn the correct pronunciation.  If you pronounce idiot, I-D-ot, people will think you are an idiot.  <p>To learn more, buy several inexpensive books, which have plenty of explanations, and the Elite Word Power CDs, which has 5000 words, but very limited explanations.</span>

                    <span>I was just about to purchase the complete CD series of this item online for $300 when I found this book at a nearby Borders store. I just saved myself $285!! And from reading all the reviews, I belive I've made a very wise "self-improvement" investment. Granted the CD's would help somewhat with certain pronunciations, but the book has a very useful key guide to guide along as well.</span>
