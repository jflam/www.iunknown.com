                <span id="Label1">What do your spiritual convictions have to do with traffic jams, job anxiety, reading the newspaper, or arguing with your spouse?  Everything, according to Marianne Williamson. It is the way we live in our everyday world that determines the shape of who we are.  So Buddhist or Muslim, Christian or Jew, it is the moment when our daughter doesn't make the basketball team, or our best friend lands our dream job, or our business instinct tells us to bury the guy across the boardroom table that tests and builds our living faith. <br><br>  With an attitude of hope, a call to forgive, a celebration of miracles, and the promise of strength and grace, Williamson helps us find our sacred footing on ordinary ground. <br><br>  No matter where we are or what we're doing, there is the opportunity to be happy, and to be holy. The large and small difficulties of our days challenge us to open our hearts and minds. And in this book of hours, Marianne Williamson teaches us to ride the currents that lurk in each of those moments of opening to a sea change of the soul.</span>

                    <span>No one, absolutely no one, can inspire me like Marianne Williamson. In today's world, with all the terrifying, depressing news that haunts us every single day, it's quite a challenge to feel that there is something we can actually do about it. The minute I picked up this book, I began to feel hopeful again. Everyday Grace is so important because it actually gives us the tools to help us shift from feeling so negative and helpless, to creating the experience of the miraculous in our lives. No mean feat for these troubled times. I don't know of anybody that can provide this kind of insight and inspiration the way Marianne Williamson does. This is the perfect Christmas present. I can't think of a better gift at this particular time. I heard Oprah say that on her show, and, after reading this book, I see what she means.</span>

                    <span>Marianne Williamson brings the wide and diverse philosophical and religious teachings together to show that we are all one, and it is only from this realization that we can open our hearts to see ourselves, our own mistakes, and our own difficulties in another. It is from this paradigm that we can come together at heart, and bring forth our own indwelling spirit to transcend and transform the difficulties humanity faces. <P>From this wonderful book, you will learn that by taking time out of the madness we call our daily schedule, you can learn how to connect to the divine presence of God within, and bring forth your highest version as a person who is divine, as you honor the divine within others. This brings about inner peace, and creates peace with all who touch our lives. <P>We may never know how much of a difference we are making, but if it coming from our heart, then we ARE making a difference for ALL, because we ARE all connected. <P>This is a wonderful book, filled with genuine spiritual and human insight that will only bring benefit to you in your life. Highly Recommended! Barbara Rose, author of, 'Individual Power' and 'If God Was Like Man'</span>

                    <span>marianne williamson is one of my favorite writers/teachers because she conveys all the basics without being preachy. better yet she remains centered enough to know she is still human and therefore learning. definitely a clear channel for love. the concepts in this book are so useful for all of us who struggle with our spirituality as we muddle through reality. get it. read it. love it.</span>

On page 4 she tells of her journey in magic, philosophy, astrology, tarot, the I Ching, she looked into Christianity, Judaism and more.<P>As you read this book, you will see that she mixes ideas/beliefs she found in magic, philosophy, astrology, tarot, the I Ching, Christianity, Judaism, course of miracles... Now the question is this, are you OK with this book feeding you with nonsense she build up from her experience in different religions? This would be like a cake that has meat, sweets, vegetables, fruits, and dirt all in one. <P>Bottom line: Occasional good thought does not make this a good book when it contains spiritual poison.</span>
