                    <span>This book is very well written with the motorcyclist in mind. Recommended camping areas, off the beaten path type routes and recommended stops along the way. Well put together and a good read, highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This books gives some pretty cool descriptions on different areas in the Southwest including Southwestern Colorado.  My husband and I are familiar with the Colorado chapter and it was as though we were going through it  again.  Except it was in words and in our minds.  My husband is going to  take the recommendations and ride from the Chicago Area to the Taos New  Mexico area.  I will follow 2 days behind him with kids in tow. The author  also provides valuable information on watering holes as well as places to  eat.  In desert areas you want to be prepared as to where the last gas  station is.  The author also gives explicit details on road conditions  which makes the trip a lot easier to palette knowing where the  "bad" spots are.  Either you choose to ride gingerly through it  or go around.  I highly recommend this book.  It's a good read and it  contains lots of valuable information.</span>
