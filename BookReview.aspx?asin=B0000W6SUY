                    <span>Great book for Mets fans, though the book does make you grit your teeth at times, mostly because of the factual errors already mentioned by other reviewers here and because of Golenbock's overreliance on the published memoirs of others, particularly the horrifically written Strawberry's.  I also think that too few members of the Mets are or would consent to be interviewed.  For instance, what's a history of the NY Mets without the POV of Ed Kranepool, who spanned three distinct eras of the team?  <p>The best account of the Mets, though only up through '73, remains Leonard Koppett's THE NEW YORK METS.  If you're interested in details and a solid analysis of the Mets transformation from bottom dogs to World Champs, Koppett's the one to beat.</span>

                    <span>"Amazin': The Miraculous History..." contained some good history of the Mets, but a lot of the history was missing. Very little was said about the Met's lean years from 1977 to 1982 and the 1990's. There is enough history for the casual Mets and baseball fan, but for someone with a knowledge of the team and its history, this book was disappointing.<p>This book would have been more interesting if each year from 1962 to 2002 had its own chapter. Along with a chapter on how the Mets came into existence, and a closing chapter with thoughts from the author, the book would be shorter, more concise, and contain more history. I did not see the need to write about the 1880's Metropolitans, nor the history of the New Yok Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers; they were not the subjects of the book, except how they left New York and this made way for the New York Mets.<p>There were some good interviews from Mets past, but not as much as would be expected for a history. As other comments stated, where were Kranepool, Seaver, Jones, Wilson and others, especially Bob Murphy and Ralph Kiner, Mets announcers who have seen every game the Mets played? Having only Al Lieter as the only interviewee for the last several chapters was really short-sighted. That's not a history; that's an opinion of one player.<p>The book was poorly edited. There were too many grammatical errors, fractured and incomplete sentences, erronious facts. I understand that most of the qoutes were from the actual interview of players, but there were too many vulgar words for me to enjoy this book. Those words could have been eliminated and the message would still be clear. <p>I jsut wish I had read all the reviews first. I doubt if I would have purchased this book.</span>

                    <span>I gave this 2 stars for its extremely uneven nature.  When Amazin is good, it is a delightful and well-researched book.  When it is bad, the book is almost unreadable.<p>The good parts are wonderful mini-biographies of George Weiss, Rod Kanehl, Gil Hodges, Casey Stengel and Bill Shea.  The whole segment on Shea is incredibly illuminating stuff.  Strangely enough though, the book ignores Weiss' great reluctance to integrate the Yankees in the 50's.  But Golenbock succeeds in shedding a great deal of light into this private man.<p>The book also goes into the original New York Metropolitans of the 19th century as well.  Maybe too well, as I found it boring.<p>Golenbock also covered the 1969 Miracle Mets and 1986 teams decently.  There is lots of good stuff from Swoboda, Seaver and Koosman on the 1969 Mets, Backman, Strawberry, Gooden and Carter on the 1986-era Mets.<p>But there are two major problems with this book, which may matter a little or a lot to a reader.<p>First off, it is far from comprehensive.  Several seasons are almost ignored, if you are doing a "full" story of the team, then you did not do the job stated.  When you give a season in the 19th century more ink than one ib the mid-70s, you are not comprehensive.<p>The other major fault is that the book contains a very small amount of sources.  For reasons only known to Mr. Golenbock, there were few people willing to talk to him on the record in this book.  The best oral biographies (See "Loose Balls" by Terry Pluto) have a wide variety of people quoted on the record.<p>In even the best sections, there are only 4-5 people talking.  That is way too few and takes away greatly from the book.  After a certain point, each source starts pushing their own agenda.  The more sources, the less apparent that becomes.  <p>The last 62 pages of the hardcover edition, covering the 1997-2001 seasons are a monologue by Al Leiter, occasionally interrupted by Golenbock.  There is NO other source quoted in that section.<p>Now Al Leiter may be a decent pitcher and a nice guy, but he pushes his own agenda quite forcefully.  Half the time he sounds like a self-serving jerk and there is nobody to disagree with him.  There is absolutely nobody there to lend some objectivity.  It is the Al Leiter show and if you like to hear him rant on and on, that is great.  But if you are looking for something more, put away the book after page 564.</span>

                    <span>I am still waiting for a definitive history of the New York Mets and their World Series championship year of 1969. This book is definitely not it. Much of what is written here feels recycled and repetitive. How can you make a year like 1969 dull? There are much better baseball books out there to spend your money on instead of this one.</span>

                    <span>In his customary fashion, the author wrote forty-five informative and entertaining chapters.  Unfortunately, the book has fifty-one chapters.  The last five must have been sub-contracted, as they bear no resemblance to the rest.  Only one subject, Al Leiter, is interviewed for the last six chapters, and the clear writing and insights disappear.  There is no ending - he just stopped writing.<p>This shopper will purchase future books by the author only after waiting for reviews and careful inspections, steps not needed until now.</span>
