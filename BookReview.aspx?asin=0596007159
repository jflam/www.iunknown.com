                    <span>I liked this book, but that's easy because it's a topic that interests me. If hardware hacking is something that you enjoy you will probably find a lot to like in this book. Because in general it's all about the tips and tricks.
<br />
<br />That being said this book, like all of the Annoyances books, is not a complete reference. You won't find the list of PC cards, but you will find tips on how to fix flaky USB connections and the like.</span>

                    <span>O'Reilly has a series of Annoyances books on the market, and I recently had a chance to review the PC Hardware Annoyances book by Stephen J. Bigelow.  It's a really good book with an enormous number of tips and tricks to fix misbehaving computer components.

<br />Index
<br />
<br />As you can see, Bigelow covers a lot of ground in the book.  I almost view this as a combination between a Hacks book and a compilation of questions asked by readers.  And in fact, the compilation angle is pretty accurate.  O'Reilly solicits annoyances from a number of sources, and these submissions make up a large part of what the author writes about.  The questions can range anywhere from pretty basic ("my cursor skips all over the screen, and the mouse doesn't seem to be controlling it very well") to pretty advanced ("I get an HPF9XDR0 error whenever I try to print to my HP printer"), and Bigelow covers all of them with complete and often humorous information.  In between the annoyance/fix entries, you will find a number of warnings, tips, and tools that will make your interactions with your hardware much more error-free.
<br />
<br />The "bad" thing about a book like this is that *your* particular annoyance may not be covered.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do about that.  But the breath of questions covered should give you some insights that can be applied to your problem if it isn't answered directly.  This is a book you probably want to have around your bookshelf "just in case" something goes wrong.  Very well done.</span>

                    <span>This is, more or less, an O'Reilly Hacks book. But reformatted in  a different series, with a more colourful appearance. What Bigelow has done is summarise a litany of common hardware gripes, and what you could do in response. Some of these will draw knowing smirks. Like the the keyboard with dirty or stuck keys. Very common in public libraries and some crowded internet cafes. Luckily, Bigelow avoids speculation as to the various possible contaminants of the keyboard. [But I will not.] Food and drink ejecta, and snot, for example. [Just thought I'd share that with you.]
<br />
<br />The book also includes discussion of laptops, PDAs and various accessories like printers and scanners. Note carefully that in the section on wireless networking, there is one overriding caution. Look up the advice on keeping your communications private. So many users remain in blissful ignorance. You should not.
<br />
<br />There do seem to be an amazing number of hacks. For this breadth alone, you may want to consider this book.</span>
