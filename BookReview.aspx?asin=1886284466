                    <span>This book's strength is that it is basically an outline of good strategy development. Another reviewer called it the book for "dummies"-like that was a criticism. It provides an excellent guide for real managers trying to get a tough job done in competition with their "real job" requirements. If you need something to impress a teacher, buy something different. If you need to get some strategic planning done in the typical workplace, put this book high on your list of resources.</span>

                    <span>This book is very poor and I would recommend against purchasing it. This guide is seems to be written by seminar teachers, full of simple one-liners and cheesy analogies that don't really add that much to your understanding of strategy. Possibly a starter guide, but not recommended if you have already read anything on strategy.</span>

                    <span>Yes the book "simplifies" a difficult process, but the real proof of its worth is actually using the plan set forth by the authors. We are well into year one of following the instructions and our 38 year old company has never communicated to the level it is now. We have already enabled ourselves to take advantage of two major opportunities that would have benn missed without planning by the book. <p>Read it sure - Use it for sure!</span>

                    <span>This book takes strategic planning off the shelf and into the realm of implementation.  It makes strategic planning an inclusive, usable, adjustable tool to manage the growth of an organization.  Too often, we hear the complaint that organizations have spent considerable time and money on creating a sophisticated strategic plan only to have it sit on the shelf for years without any action taken.  Simplified Strategic Planning is just that, a process that retains the complexity inherent in creating a comprehensive plan for an organization while breaking it down into small, clear, actionable steps.  Perhaps the best part of this book is that in addition to creating a strategic plan, underlying the process is a deep understanding of how to involve people in the work of gathering data, analyzing the data and then creating a customized strategic plan.</span>

                    <span>Finally, a book on strategic planning that makes sense!  Bradford's process for helping organizations think about, plan for and implement strategic planning is straightforward and completely accessible.  Whatever size your oganization, and whatever your background in strategy, this one is a must-read.  Bradford offers an action-oriented approach that allows you to customize the process to meet your needs.  In these days of leaner budgets, take advantage of this gem--it's almost like having Bradford in your company as you work through the process.  His focus is on results, and his success with all kinds of organizations is very impressive.</span>
