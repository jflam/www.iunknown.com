                <span id="Label1">Imagine running into the ultimate management mentor late one night on an otherwise deserted commuter train, and walking away from the strange encounter with an encapsulated guide to success in the corporate world. That's exactly what screenwriter and business coach Patrick Lencioni has done in <i>The Five Temptations of a CEO: A Leadership Fable</i>, placing his tale in an easy-reading and thought- provoking kind of self-help novel. <p>  Designed to be read in a single sitting, this book uses the unexpected meeting between troubled high-tech honcho Andrew O'Brien and a mysterious old man named Charlie to explore a series of common traps that can unwittingly ensnare any hard-driven executive. Lencioni hones in on the five "temptations" of the workplace: desires to jealously guard career status, consistently remain popular with subordinates, unfailingly make correct decisions, constantly strive for an atmosphere of total harmony, and always appear invulnerable. A discussion of the story's events and their real-world implications follows, as Lencioni shifts from screenwriter mode to business coach to help answer some of the questions he raises. <I>--Howard Rothman</I> </span>

                    <span>This is the second book by Patrick Lencioni I've read (after the inevitable five dysfunctions of a team). It's not as good of a story, but its underlying message - the temptations, are a well deserved lesson. Being a people-manager for the past several years has been a challenging, fascinating and at times humbling experience. This book describes some of the mistakes I've made and some of the mistakes I've seen being made around me, and puts it all in a coherent framework. And that's all I really expect from a good management book - to be able to put your experience in some new frame of reference. This enabled me to take another look at my habits and conduct and, hopefully, improve some of them. 
<br />I recommend this book to new managers after going through one or two years of actually leading teams/groups of people. Unless you walk in a leader's shoes, the theory alone is of little help. You just won't have anything to hang on the structure described here.</span>

                    <span>I think this is a must read book. Easy to read and entertaining. I really believe that at some point in our lives we all fall into one or more of the temptations. It is almost impossible to avoid them, mostly because we are unable to identify them. This book really opened my eyes and it will certainly open yours too.</span>

                    <span>This book was short, sweet, and to the point. Although it is focused on CEO as the prototype, this really points to anyone in a leadership and managrial role. The fable is illustrative, and the flow chart and short didactic at the end spells out the key message. It's worth pulling out and quickly reviewing once or twice a year to check back into your own personal growth and areas that still need improvement</span>

                    <span>I am amazed at some of the negative reviews about this great little book.  I guess these negative people are not familiar with what a FABLE is?  I think this book hits all of us executives right in the face with what we all struggle with.  I think this is a must read (no, you will not feel like you have just read Atlas Shrugged after you are finished) for all execs, or people who aspire to lead organizations.  I am excited to read the rest of the collection</span>

                    <span>This is the crapiest anti-motivational book I ever got to read.<br>It is a story of Andrew who is a CEO and who meets with an old man one night in the train. The old man is a janitor and his father was a CEO (whatever)so the janitor, CEO's son (Gosh)starts<br>mentoring Andrew on how he should run his company.<br>If this janitor was smart enough to motivate a CEO how come he <br>ended up being a janitor in the first place?!?<p>I thought, to be a writer you have to be born as a writer but only now I realized that anyone can be a writer and Patrick <br>Lencioni is the worst one from the ones I've read.<p>Am I just being paranoid or is the today's literature following<br>today's music fate ?!?</span>
