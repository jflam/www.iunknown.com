                <span id="Label1"><P><B></B> Most books on operating systems deal with   theory while ignoring practice. While the usual principles are covered in   detail, the book describes a small, but real UNIX-like operating system: MINIX.   The book demonstrates how it works while illustrating the principles behind it.   <B></B> <I>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation Second   Edition</I> provides the MINIX source code. The relevant selections of the MINIX   code are described in detail. When it first came out, MINIX caused something of   a revolution. Within weeks, it had its own newsgroup on USENET, with 40,000   people. Most wanted to make MINIX bigger and fancier. Instead, Linux was   created. That has become quite popular, very large, and complicated. MINIX, on   the other hand, has remained small and suitable for instruction and example.   The book has been revised to include updates in MINIX, which started out as a v   7 unix clone for a floppy-disk only 8088. It is now aimed at 386, 486, and   pentium machines and is based on the international posix standard instead of on   v7. There are now also versions of MINIX for the Macintosh and SPARC available.   <B></B> Professional programmers will find this book to be a valuable   resource and reference book.     </P></span>

                    <span>The book focus on Operating Systems and includes source code of a mini OS called Minix. Till I read it, I always read rave reviews, but found it to be quite over rated. The pros of the book includes the source for reference, a Micro kernel OS design, while what is not really upto the mark is the language tends to be difficult thereby making a tough subject even more tougher, the author's view tends to spill over and are juvenile with cliches like all students are trying to hack systems, etc and does not cover various aspects of OS subsystems.<P>My recomendation would be the book by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin called "Operating System Concepts" incase of you are starting off or just want a very easy to read book or consider various approaches.</span>

                    <span>First there was Unix, then Minix , now Linux. Before Unix became a proprietary OS, its source code was available freely, hence the codes were used by many OS courses in colleges. Then things changed and the source code is no longer free. OS books will only present theories but not enough source code to show the implementation. This book is different. The authors took an extra initiative to create Minix which implements many features of Unix (and Linux) and include it into this book. I believe that this is a very good book to study OS in depth. It is reasonable that some mind stretching is needed as the subject of OS is sophisticated and complex. Highly recommended especially for Linux and Unix devotees.</span>

                    <span>This was the text for an OS course that I took for my Masters. We had to implement 11 significant OS features for Minix (e.g. floppy disk cache, VGA driver, interprocess communication server,...) -- bugs were unacceptable (i.e. fail), as OSs must work. This class was 4 times more work that an other class I took for my Masters but I learned so much. I was already a very experienced Unix programmer when I took this, so I found it facinating to finally see what was under the hood (Minix/Unix is surprisingly small an compact -- very elegant). Tanenbaum is a real authority on the subject of operating systems and has a very engaging style. Probably the best computer science text book that I have read (I read this cover to cover, not just scanning but really reading). There is room for improvement though: the format could benefit from being updated, I had to use a lot of high-lighter. Clearer separation and indexing of key theories and sections would help. The OS basics are still relevant today (and could perhaps benefit from some expansion/clarification). I believe Tanenbaum has brought out new books since that go into some more contemporary / more advance areas.</span>

                    <span>The authors of this text assume too much. This pretty much sums up the entirety of the work, which is too technical to make a good introductory text and too simple to make a good advanced discussion of operating systems.<P>First off, you need a very strong understanding of the C programming language to get anything out of this book. The length of the text is deceiving- almost half of it is actually printed source code of the MINIX operating system. What the other half of the book does is, essentially, wade through said source code. If you don't know C well, you're not going anywhere with this. I suggest buying 'The C Programming Language' (Prentice Hall: Kernighan, Ritchie) and 'Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment' (Addison Wesley: Stevens) if you don't already own them. <P>While the authors do go into some discussion about how the various parts of an operating system work, they don't go into any of the actual details. Why? Because MINIX simply doesn't DO a lot of these things (e.g. deadlock prevention, swapping or paging, advanced scheduling). If you're actually thinking of writing your own OS, you'll only get a general idea of what needs to be done, nothing more. The theory is covered quite well, but if you're looking for what this book advertises on the cover ('Design and Implementation') you will probably be disappointed.<P>There are some advantages to this text. I would have given it a higher rating, but I think the current one is deceptive. For one, if you're familiar with UNIX or Linux, MINIX is very similar. It's also a lot simpler and shorter code-wise, so it doesn't take a guru to modify the source. Also, like Linux, it isn't copyrighted. The system itself works well and is very educational. The book's resources are also well done, with an included CD that has all the source and comprehensive instructions on how to install it (be sure you backup first!). MINIX is also very well commented and, if you know C, is quite easy to understand. <P>Further, non-material problems with the text include a discussion that seems to jump from one place to another and doesn't make good use of diagrams. You'll often find a very useful diagram in the book... except that it's about three chapters ahead of where it really would have been enlightening. Key terms are in bold, but aren't summarized anywhere else in the book, oftentimes including the index! This can make it annoying to look up something you can't remember. Additionally, the numerous references to the MINIX source code simply refer to line numbers. Some might not mind this, but I personally found it frustrating to have to keep flipping back and forth between one half of the book and the other. It would have helped if the authors had just put the relevant source where it's discussed and left out the entire listing in the back. It's available on the CD and online anyway, if you need to look at all of it. <P>In summary, Operating Systems 2nd Ed. is very average in quality as a textbook, both for beginners and gurus. The MINIX operating system is well planned and designed, but the book itself offsets this quality with its flaws.</span>

                    <span>This is another of Tannenbaums great books. It is delightful to read his books. It deepens your understanding and gives you a feeling of happiness at the same time.<BR>Specifically this book contains the entire source code of an OS (Minix THE predecessor of LINUX). It is complete and thoroughly explained. The source code is in C and sometimes in Assembler. Especially the Assembler parts are hard to grasp. The C code is sometimes very lucid sometimes I simply got lost. So I just stuck to the main text.</span>
