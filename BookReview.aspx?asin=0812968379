                <span id="Label1">In 1972, when she was seven, Firoozeh Dumas and her family moved from Iran to Southern California, arriving with no firsthand knowledge of this country beyond her father&#8217;s glowing memories of his graduate school years here. More family soon followed, and the clan has been here ever since. <br><br>Funny in Farsi chronicles the American journey of Dumas&#8217;s wonderfully engaging family: her engineer father, a sweetly quixotic dreamer who first sought riches on Bowling for Dollars and in Las Vegas, and later lost his job during the Iranian revolution; her elegant mother, who never fully mastered English (nor cared to); her uncle, who combated the effects of American fast food with an army of miraculous American weight-loss gadgets; and Firoozeh herself, who as a girl changed her name to Julie, and who encountered a second wave of culture shock when she met and married a Frenchman, becoming part of a one-couple melting pot. <br><br>In a series of deftly drawn scenes, we watch the family grapple with American English (hot dogs and hush puppies?&#8212;a complete mystery), American traditions (Thanksgiving turkey?&#8212;an even greater mystery, since it tastes like nothing), and American culture (Firoozeh&#8217;s parents laugh uproariously at Bob Hope on television, although they don&#8217;t get the jokes even when she translates them into Farsi).<br><br>Above all, this is an unforgettable story of identity, discovery, and the power of family love. It is a book that will leave us all laughing&#8212;without an accent.</span>

                    <span>Firoozeh Dumas lived in Iran when very young and, in 1972, moved to California with her family when her father, the hilarious and touching Kazem, is relocated for his job. Firoozeh's accounts of all that is puzzling and wonderful about the USA in general and California in particular, especially to someone out of the mainstream race and religion, rings just as true today as it did back then.<P>Dumas' sense of humor about society, her family and herself is well-played by telling funny memories without turning anything into a joke. She describes the difference that immigrants from various countries face -- in light of the Iranian hostage crisis, she is regarded with fear, and her mother starts telling people, in her thick Persian accent, that they are French. When Firoozeh meets her husband Francois, who is from France, people greet him with delighted winderment about their last trip to France, as if Francois is personally responsible for their great time there.<P>At times, I felt saddened at how well her father braves everything -- when the family is attacked by protestors in Washington, DC when then-President Jimmy Carter invites Iranian-Americans to meet the Shah of Iran, he finds a silver lining by pointing out they saw all the monuments while escaping the mob. <P>Other accounts just make me laugh because they are all too true. When she is planning her Muslim wedding, it is important she never leave anyone off the guest list, even if the likelihood is that they on't attend because they are in another country. As she writes "We invited 140 people, 163 accepted, and 181 showed up."<P>This is a great rich book that gives insight to a way of life not many people know about.</span>

                    <span>If you ever wondered what it was like to grow up an immigrant in the United States, Funny in Farsi is a telling story of this experience. Firoozeh Dumas writes a candid account of growing up Persian in America. From her parents adjusting the customs and cultures of America, to the impacts of the hostage crisis on her life in the US, and her own growing up experiences with her family, she paints a picture of how humor helps get through all the tough times. <BR>Although this book is about a Persian family in the US, it transcends culture barriers and tells the universal story of what it means to be an immigrant in the United States and the difficulties that it entails.<BR>Dumas writes an honest account of her life that the reader can relate to. Her poignant language and truthful analysis of life makes this a book that you will not be able to put down.<BR>This is a truly delightful book.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I was really craving a book written by an iranian so I could relate to... The book is well written if you want to have some fun laughing at extremely superficial issues about iranians living in the US, but totally lacks a real understanding of the situation. In few words this was a teenager book although I would not even recommend it to teenagers to read</span>

                    <span>It would have been wonderful if she wrote it to share with her family and friends, but to publish it? There is no substance, it is not particularly funny and it is just plain boring. This book proves that not everybody needs to write a memoir.<P>I've been married into Iranian family and I recognized a lot of traits she is describing. The book was amusing, at times. However, I would not recommend it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This has to be one of the most entertaining books that I have ever read. I am so impressed with her writing, her honesty and willingness to share the story of her life and her touching recollections. Better yet, the story is mixed with humor all along. <P>When Firoozeh tells a story about financial problems, family issues, discrimination and injustice, she does so with humor and dignity, although you can even TOUCH the pain she had felt at the moment! <BR>In this book, She also talks about some occasional unpleasant traits shown by her family, however it's clear the she loves them and that love shows through. She knows that you can love someone and not like everything that they do. <P>Reading Firoozeh's book makes me laugh out loud so many times. There are plenty of serious moments but they are all rendered with the remarkable wit of a very funny author, Firoozeh Dumas. Even the parts that should be dull in a biography are worthwhile and interesting.<P>I consider this book one of the best; I hope that you will too</span>
