                <span id="Label1">BLACK SUN, a bittersweet love story, is about a forest ranger -- loner, iconclast, lover of the rugged life -- who falls for an utterly beguiling freckle-faced "American princess" half his age.  <P>Like Lady Chatterley's lover, he initiates her into the rite of sex and the stark, hidden harmonies of his wild wooded kingdom and canyons. She, in turn, awakens in him the pleasures of loving and being loved. Then she disappears, plunging him into a gloom he can barely support.  <P>"If the ending is sad and haunting, the book is not. It's a lyrical romance with the kind of passion and scenery that Abbey alone can conjure up." (B-O-T Editorial Review Board)</span>

                    <span>In typical Ed Abbey fashion, a beautiful book that explores the depth of Abbey's romantic side. Environmental and isolationist, this book will appeal to the outdoorsy, just-want-to-get-away-from-it-all type.</span>

                    <span>For those of you who feel this is not a "normal" Abbey book, you are right in one sence but not totally. You must take into account that this book was written shortly after his wife passed away. So there were thoughts and feelings and emotions that he was going through that dictated the lay of this book. The woman who disappears, never seen again, all boils back to the heartbreak Abbey was going through after loosing his young wife. This is a great book to pick up if you want to read one of Abbey's different styles of writing.</span>

                    <span>Beautiful, lyrical, magical - the best book Abbey ever wrote, in my opinion. I suppose many would argue the point, as Abbey doesn't address environmental issues at all, and the story is strictly a love story. But it is a wonderful story written in remarkable metaphorical prose - fantastic.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>An early Abbey work, Black Sun is a very good novel written in a style similar to John D. MacDonald only more alive, more real. Will Gatlin is much like Travis McGee, an imperfect fellow who has learned to live life on his own terms and makes no apologies for it. An entertaining read, this is one you won't want to put down until you've finished it.</span>

                    <span>I could not put this book down. All Edward Abbey lovers will be enchanted with this book. Those of you that skip it are missing out on an all time treasure. This book is an excellent way to distract yourself from the World Trade Center disaster.</span>
