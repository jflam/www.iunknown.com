                    <span>        Aging with Grace is an accessible and easy to read book packed with complex scientific and research data presented in understandable language.  The author, David Snowdon, writes with a compassionate style that engages the reader draws them into the story of the Nun Study.  This book is more than just a mere presentation of the results of the Nun Study and its impact on Alzheimer's research; it is biography and a truly human story.  The lives of the sisters who participated in the study are made known to the reader and the reader becomes attached to them and the great legacy that they are leaving for humanity.  Much can be learned on a human and spiritual level from the stories of the sister participants that goes beyond the scientific data and study results.  Snowdon does and excellent job of weaving humanity with science resulting in the reader learning and engaging in science without becoming scientific.
<br />
<br />	Aging with Grace is both compelling and interesting.  The facts and figures and statistics as well as academic references are noticeably absent from this tome and I don't miss them.  This book was fun to read because the story was so human.  It was also written with a hopeful tone, one that is not often found in Alzheimer's literature.  I feel I have a good general overview of the research being done to understand the causes of Alzheimer's disease.  
<br />
<br />	Aging with Grace reads like a biography.  Dr. Snowdon brings the lives of the sisters to life and the reader can connect with their stories.  It is through the stories of the sisters that Dr. Snowdon tells the story of the study and presents the science, yet the book is more than science.  It is the story of spirit, human spirit and divine spirit.  The dedication and commitment of the School Sisters of Notre Dame to Dr. Snowdon and Dr. Snowdon to the sisters becomes a synergy that feeds the study and the study evolves and grows deeper.  Both the sisters and Dr. Snowdon are changed by their relationship with one another.
<br />
<br />	What stared out as a study on longevity evolved into an important study on aging and Alzheimer's disease.  The initial study to gather data on longevity and the factors that contribute to longevity is never forgotten, but as the study evolves to focus on Alzheimer's disease, the goals of the study seem to run on parallel tracks.  New aspects of the study seem to flow seamlessly into the existing study and expand and build upon existing research.  The way Dr. Snowdon tells the story, the process seems to be without the difficulties that probably existed in reality.  There is always a back story, but the reader of  Aging with Grace is not privy to the back story.
<br />
<br />	This book is truly a popular press and not an academic book.  It is a good read and I would recommend it anyone who wanted to have a general understanding of Alzheimer's research.  It is not a book that provides details about the disease process or caregiving for persons with Alzheimer's disease, if that was needed, I would recommend The 36-hour Day, with the caveat that the The 36-hour Day is dry reading.  I appreciated Dr. Snowdon's humble approach to the telling the story.  He graciously named the persons who were part of his team and helped with the study.  
<br />
<br />	What really touched me most about this book was the non preachy way that the findings were presented.  Dr. Snowdon doesn't come right out and say, "if you want to live longer, exercise, eat a balanced diet, exercise your mind, and keep a positive emotional life connected to people who love and care for you" but the reader is able to conclude this from the way the material is presented and is left to their own to make necessary lifestyle changes if they wish to apply the study findings to their own life.  The book is encouraging and not preachy so people may actually hear the science and apply it.
<br />
<br />	This book makes a contribution to the field of gerontology in that it makes research findings accessible to the general public.  This is a book about research and it is helpful in that it shows the practical applications of research to the understanding human longevity and more specifically how Alzheimer's disease affects a specialized population.  Researchers can learn from Dr. Snowdon and the example that this book presents on how to make their findings accessible to the general public.  The overall work and findings of the Nun Study will continue to inform research being done on human longevity and Alzheimer's disease in the future.  I also think that the relationships that developed between Dr. Snowdon and the sisters in the study, even if it `violates' the traditional rules of objective research may be a new model for doing research with humans.  This study is a cooperative effort and that cooperative effort is a new paradigm that would be interesting to apply in other fields.
<br />
<br />	This book is worthy of recommending to the general public, students, and professionals in that it is well written, easy to read, and packed with information presented in an easy to understand manner.  The reader will come away with a good general knowledge of human longevity and the factors that influence longevity as well as a general knowledge of Alzheimer's research.  It is one book that I have read on Alzheimer's disease that leaves me with a sense of hope about a rather dismal subject.

                    <span>Dr. Snowdon, who'd been conducting a multi-faceted study of a group of nuns for about 15 years at the time of the writing of this book (2001), presents a heart-warming account of his team's findings directed at the lay person.
<br />
<br />The book is only about 200 pages long but is worth much more than its weight in gold. As Snowdon goes on telling the beautiful stories of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, you will realize that reading and learning are key to leading a healthy life, both at young and old age; that having an optimistic outlook on things helps ward off the onset of degenerative diseases; that being an active participant in the activities of your community - your family, club or school - will leverage your chances of prolonging your mental health; that a balanced diet, rich in vitamins, folic acid and lycopene may stave off disease.
<br />
<br />The touching stories of sisters Nicolette, Esther, Matthia, Dolores and many, many others will stay with you forever and help you cope with the process of aging (your own or that of a relative, spouse, etc). 
<br />
<br />Many thanks to the School Sisters of Notre Dame and Dr Snowdon and his team for such a precious book.</span>

                    <span>Ever since my father's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, I've worried about the little things I forget.  Never mind that I've always been a little absentminded, I fretted  about whether I received the dreaded APOE-4 gene in the genetic package he bequeathed me.  
<br />
<br />This book gave me hope - lots of it!  
<br />
<br />It shows clearly that the symptoms of Alzheimer's are not merely an immutable result of your genetic heritage but also of how you've lived your life.  Reading about the nun who, in spite of a brain riddled with tangles and plaques, like the Energizer Bunny, kept on going and going, gave me plenty to hope for.
<br />
<br />Caring, kindness, love, service - all are integral to the community of nuns.  Theirs is a joyful story and a fascinating read.  Don't miss it.  
<br />
<br />Six Stars!</span>

                    <span>David Snowdon's Aging with Grace is the first book on a clinical topic I have been unable to put down.  It quickly became one of those books you find every opportunity you can to read on (the "Oh, I can read it while I'm eating my oatmeal" almost made me late to work).  <p>The book has the feel of memoir - as we learn the stories of the Sisters involved.  However, there is also deep clinical value. Snowdon (and the women who generously become subjects) has made a major contribution to the field of Alzheimer's reasearch with this study.  The conclusions should intrigue professionals.  The writing is accessible enough that non-professionals can also draw a lot from it. <p>I would recommend this highly to both colleagues and family members and individuals affected by Alzheimers.  I would also recommend it to anyone who is interested in monastic life.  Sort of an Olver Sacks (Awakenings) meets Kathleen Norris (The Cloister Walk) - with beautiful results.</span>
