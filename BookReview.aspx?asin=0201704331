                <span id="Label1">Written by several of Java's inventors, <I>The Java Programming  Language, Third Edition</I> provides a nearly indispensable guide to basic and  advanced features in today's hottest programming language. Perfect for the  intermediate or advanced developer, this book delivers a wealth of information  on how to do more with Java. The first sections provide a nicely compact tour of  Java basics. If you're a beginner, you'll get a glimpse of the fundamentals of  Java quickly. (Most of this new edition has the more experienced reader in  mind.) Subsequent chapters delve into basic and advanced language features of  what can be done with classes, interfaces, and other design features in Java.  The authors' explanations are notably clear and never pedantic. Many examples  are illustrated by using simple mathematical problems, and the class-design  samples for inheritance and interfaces all use comprehensible class names and  concepts.<p>  This title is outstanding when it comes to class design. It will definitely let  any reader do more with classes, whether you want to make use of such features  as "anonymous inner classes" and reflection (for loading classes dynamically),  or do more with interfaces (including extending interfaces and tricks on  changing data members in interfaces).  <p>  Prominent sections here include a complete guide to Java language statements,  including keywords, literals, and support for Unicode. Later sections feature a  nice, clear explanation of Java's complicated I/O classes, a fine tutorial on  threading, and a solid introduction to using Java's collection classes. The book  closes with a tour of some additional "core" Java packages that are available in  the language.<p>  In all, this up-to-the-minute guide to some of the more complex features in  today's Java fills a valuable niche for any Java developer. Besides providing a  glimpse into what the Java team at Sun is up to, this authoritative resource can  help you master the finer points of class design, as well as make the most out  of newly added features in the new JDK 1.3 standard. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> QuickStart overview of Java, class and object design in  Java, access control, construction and initialization, static methods, method  overloading, class inheritance, redefining members, the <I>protected</I>  keyword, the <I>strictfp</I> keyword and floating-point processing, cloning  objects, interfaces (constants, methods, and modifiers), extending interfaces,  marker interfaces, nested classes and interfaces (including static nested types,  inner classes, and anonymous inner classes), tokens, operators, and expressions  in Java, literals, keywords, operator precedence, control flow, Java exception  handling, exception classes, the <I>String</I> and <I>StringBuffer</I> classes,  threads, synchronization APIs and techniques (scheduling, thread groups, and  thread local storage), the wrapper classes for Number types, Java reflection,  loading classes, garbage collection (GC algorithms, finalization and  reachability states), packages, JavaDoc documentation tags, tour of Java I/O  stream classes, serialization techniques, new and legacy Java collections,  miscellaneous utility classes, system programming with properties, processes and  JVM shutdown; internationalization and localization techniques, and tour of  additional Java "core" packages.</span>

                    <span>If you are already a developer and wanted to learn Java then this is the book for you. This book clearly explains the language its nuances (this book is not verbose). The examples used by authors to demonstrate the concepts are excellent. I programmed a lot in C/C++ and the books I used to learn those languages are "The C Programming Language" and "The C++ Programming Language" respectively. Ironically, when I started learning Java I did not take up this book. Instead I tried several books and there are some good books out there but nothing that suited me well. I prefer "to the point" discussion that this book provides when learning a language and also like to know why a certain feature was included in the language. This book did exactly that. But if you are new to programming, then this book may not be for you. <P>Other books that you may like to take a look at are:<P>1) Thinking in Java. This is available on the for Free(But its too verbose for my tastes).<P>2) Taming java threads( By Allan Holub. A very nice discussion of Java Threads and Caveats)</span>

                    <span>Nearly 14 years ago, I learned C from a terse little book "The_C_Programming_Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie ("C by K&R") - principals in the creation of C. In similar tradition, I chose "The_Java_Programming_Language" ("JPL") by Arnold and Gosling (first edition) as the foundation for my Java learning experience. Mastering the fundamental philosophy and elements of any Language is crucial in understanding how (and why) to use it. In this way, "JPL" certainly does not disappoint. Basic "core" Java elements (java.lang, java.util, and java.io) are clearly explained in a terse style similar to "C by K&R". In addition, "JPL" correlates Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals that relate directly to Java (Chapters 2 & 3). However, previous or collateral exposure to OOP is generally considered necessary because the "JPL" is first a book about Java, OOP principles simply surface "by extension". Like "C by K&R", the examples in "JPL" are succinct and have meaningful correspondence to real-world programming. I highly recommend "The Java Programming Language" - especially for seasoned C/C++ developers who are new to Java.</span>

                    <span>I'm disappointed with many of the low rated comments, this book is not for beginners, its an intermediate to advanced text. When you read the description it states: "Most of this new edition has the more experienced reader in mind". <P>I started out with this book in college, it was assigned reading and I hated it, I had to read each page twice. But as I got more proficient with java and wanted to learn all the fine points, I couldn't find another book out there that delves into the core of the language as well as this book does. Most java books out there spend half the book discussing swing and the api classes, but this book discusses the language itself. If you're a software engineer especially, the most difficultly you'll have is debugging complicated code, you'll need to have a good understanding of how java works under the hood.<P>This book was invaluable to me at work, because I didn't really understand why certain variables weren't getting updated, until I read that unless you specify them as volatile, a class will keep a cached copy of them. I had problems with the order of initialization of certain variables in a subclass, and then I read that top most super class gets instantiated first, then its subclass, on down the line, fields first, then the constructor guts.<P>You can assume that any book written by the creator(s) of a language wont be introductory, but will give you an in depth look at the finer points of the language that other, more cursory books, gloss over.</span>

                    <span>As many of the other reviewers have noted, this is a good book for those coming from programming in another language such as C++. It provides a good overview of the standard library of classes you'll find in java.lang and java.util. The example code is generally well written and exhibits good programming behavior.<P>But, by far, the best feature of this particular book is its index. The index is very, very complete and well done. It's always easy to find exactly what you're looking for. A good index can often make or break a book; in this case, it really makes it.</span>
