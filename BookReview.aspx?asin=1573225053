                    <span>For some readers who found this book after reading some of Kerouac's more conventional literary works, this novel may come off as a bit tedious.  Kerouac wasn't that great an experimental novelist, or at least not as graceful with spontaneous prose and extra-sensory perceptive description as his pier William S. Burroughs, as exemplified by the book's more incoherent and often undermanaged meanderings.  As a piece of creative autobiography, however, the novel is a symbolic giant of originality, fearlessly defying traditional literary convention and organization.  For those seeking out Kerouac for more traditional entertainment, however, the novel proves far more complex than a single reading may warrant.</span>

                    <span>If you've read On the Road, then this is a must read.  It is a true journey into the mind of a madman.  A more intimate look into the man that defined a generation of our parents, parents.  As a younger reader of the generation today it is beneficial for us to see how people lived in past generations and take with us their experiences that in a sense you could not experience today.  If I've taken anything from this book its the showing of the need for insanity in the life of Kerouac.  And the need for constinent movement, not just in the physical sense but also in the mental sense of having his mind in constient movement.</span>

                    <span>But he is an awesome writer, human being, and metaphysicist (which I believe is the whole point of his work).  What Kerouac does in his literature, particularly this piece, is thoroughly illustrate the rift created in the worlds of those who are torn between a culturally prescribed allgience/addiction to idealism and a fear that existentialsm is the only truth to which one can rightfully subscribe.  <br>I would certainly point to "Desolation Angels" as the pinnacle of the body of Kerouac's work, and reccomend the book to anyone similarly riddled with Kerouac's spiritual affliction. Or anyone who wishes to study his genre of literature.<br>I do not reccomend the book to anyone who is easily bored.  Though BEAUTIFUL, the text is long, complex, and a bit heavy at times, which can become frustrating.  Better to start out with (hey - if you're going to read Kerouac you need to read this book anyway...) "On The Road", which is more of a thrill ride and will compel you to keep reading so you might adjust and become more prepared to digest the poetry he puts into paragraphs and stretches into hundreds of pages.<p>But that's just my ten-cents' worth.  You can decide for yourself.</span>

                    <span>Let me tell you a story. I had just come down to<br>San Francisco after a couple of years of bumming <br>around the Great Northwest. It was a Monday morning<br>and I had picked up a newspaper; bound and determined<br>to scour the want ads until I found prospects for an<br>honest job, with the full intention of becoming more<br>respectful. I went to a cafe in North Beach and had a <br>seat at one of the outdoor tables. As I began to unfold<br>the newspaper, I noticed that someone had left a copy <br>of "Desolation Angels" on the chair. I picked it up and <br>started to read it. Several hours later I abandoned my<br>faint tries at redemption and walked over to Washington<br>Square to work on some poetry. The man can flat out write.<br>That's why they call him the King of the Beats.</span>
