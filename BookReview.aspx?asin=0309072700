                    <span>Why so few? This is the question which the author put on the first page of the book. More than 300 scientists have won the Nobel Prize since its establishment,however, only 10 of them are women.  Why? Why have so few women won the Nobel Prize in science? Some people might say this small number could be evidence for old prejudices. But the author tried to find a different answer through this book.  This book contains stories of 15 women scientists who won the Nobel Prize or had a critical role in Nobel Prize winning works. Although this book takes the style of a biography and also describes all the scientific details quite well, it is neither just a biography nor just a science book for general readers. It is more than both of them. These women scientists had gone through lots of difficulties. All of them had experiences of being rejected from the opportunity of receiving a higher education. Most of them had more than once been mistreated and disregarded of their abilities as well as their works. And some of them, such as Rosalind Franklin, still have not received the full credit which she deserves.  One might say that all the scientists who did remarkable works had faced and overcome many kinds of difficulties. But these women had to carry the added burden of being "women scientists". So, as the author pointed, another question should arise when the book is finished. Why so many? Why have so many women challenged themselves with such difficult works in spite of all the obstacles? The answer is simple. They loved science.  And, through this book, the readers will find a love and a understanding for these fearless women as well as their lover,science.</span>

                    <span>Nobel Prize Women in Science is a superb collection of hour-long  biographies of women who either won a Nobel Prize or worked on a project  that won a Nobel Prize in science.  The biographies are full of memorable  vignettes and quotes and lucid explanations of the scientific discoveries.   This reader found the book liberating because it debunked so many myths she  had had about good scientists.  This book makes great bedtime reading and  excellent gifts for both men and women.</span>

                    <span>I was enthralled by this delightful, healing, and eye opening crediting over the wonder works of scientific endeavor made by woman--unsung  heroines who did not flinch one bit from their true calling, what for all  the drowning out and dumbing down of class ostracism inundating them and  their sisters in their times.  These  Ladies are the truest measure of what  is called a benchmark in the progress of humanity to wake up and rise to  The Greatest Challenge:  to free the mind, the spirit, the yoke of  history's  circumstance, to unite us in peace, recognition, respect, and  unqualified defference to all who carry forth the Light.  From my heart,  Thank You Sharon Bertsch McGrayne!  And for those  for whom it is easier to  quip, 'a woman's place is in the home, raising children and so forth....'   I'll just add, we  got  BILLIONS of 'em.</span>

                    <span>Remarkable book. The lives and challenges of these women are faithfully described, not only detailing their careers but their personalities as well. These women become more than names mentioned in textbooks, and these  accounts of their lives allow them to become inspiring women. The accounts  have more science than an average reader would probably like (as a bio  major, I loved the detail), but I can guarantee they will find this book  interesting all the same. I especially liked the way the author corrected  the misconception of Rosalind Franklin as given through Dr. James Watson's  account, "The Double Helix."</span>

                    <span>The book is a little heavy to read but is very absorbing.  Both the science and personal attributes of the women reviewed are documented in a matter-of-fact manner with few distracting adjectives.  You can easily read  about one or all of the women and cross referencing of events is well done.   I found it enthusing whilst doing a PhD in an area of few women.  I have  no struggle compared to the trials relayed in this book.  Not for a light  reader.</span>
