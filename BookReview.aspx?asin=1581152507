                <span id="Label1">Approach page design in a revolutionary new way! Unlike other graphic design books, The Elements of Graphic Design reveals the secrets of successful graphic design from the unique perspective of the page&#146;s "white space." With the help of carefully selected examples from art, design, and architecture, the role of white space as a connection between page elements is thoroughly explored. Clear, insightful comments are presented in a dynamic page design, and interactive design elements, thought-provoking captions, and scores of illustrations challenge designers to "think out of the box." This unique resource is guaranteed to inspire more creative and thorough thinking.</span>

                    <span>An in depth view that stops short of being a hardcore text book though I would not hesitate to use it as an introductory text for a college class. This makes it an enjoyable, non-threatening, yet extensive, read that lists many design principles for mainly print type publications. The design principles are taught such that they can be more broadly applied to other disciplines by a creative thinker. Contents include the concepts of: Space, Unity, Page Architecture, and Type. A good first read on the subject and gives much more useful information and advice than many of the self glorifying self indulgent publications that other designers put out. The book does not list many specifics for different types of publications, it does give an in depth description of the guiding theories of design for print. the chapters on the use of space are more complete than others I've read. Highly recommended</span>

                    <span>Very solid book (but short) packed with examples of why one strategy or tactic might be better than another. I learned a lot and intend to reread the book to make sure I get as much of it absorbed as I can. Very good discussions on type with discussions on line spacing, type size, small caps, grids, symmetry vs. asymmetry, negative and positive space. <p>Wish I would have read this book before I went to design school. I would have learned a lot more. I also would have been able to speak more intelligently. I learned a lot of terminology that will help me. I'm a better designer now. It's given me more confidence. <p>Highly recommended for beginners and intermediates. Might be a little thin for experts.</span>

                    <span>Alex White has hit a home run with his book The Elements of Graphic Design. This definitive introduction to the basics of what makes a succesful visual composition should be in every design classroom and student backpack. The writing is clear and the principals easy to understand and apply. I especially liked the examples and advice on the use of "negative space" and typography. Although the book is geared toward the beginning designer, there are enough advanced concepts and examples to make this a worthwhile reference for designers at all levels. A fine addition to design literature.</span>

                    <span>A fantastic overview of the principles of layout and how to understand space and "the page", with special concern for the issue of functional white space and learning how to activate it, sculpt it, and not waste it. In a milieu of visual clutter, this gift to the design world (if its message is taken to heart) will help restore order and readability in the communications that surround us.</span>
