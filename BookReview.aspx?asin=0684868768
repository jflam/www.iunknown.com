                    <span>This book deals with a very important topic - how new organizations arise  in the various contexts of biology, cognitive science, sociology, and computer science. The author, a science writer, is clearly enthusiastic about his subject, and he provides several vivid examples of emergence phenomena, including the spontaneous development of patterns in ant colonies, the growth of cities, the development of the World Wide Web, and emergence of mind from the ten to one hundred neurons of the human brain.
<br />
<br />General books of this sort, it seems to me, fall into three classes. The first - which includes Steven Johnson's "Emergence" - comprise books written by skillful writers who have little basic scientific knowledge and are therefore uncomfortably dependent on the particular experts whom they choose to interview. The second class is written by scientists who are familiar with the many details of their area, but lack the ability to write. These writers often produce books that are informative but tedious for the general reader. The third class, of which there are few examples, are by scientists who also know how to write. 
<br />
<br />It seems to me unfair to criticize Johnson for not being a scientist, as other reviewers of this book have done. Johnson does not claim to be a scientist and the reader cannot expect him to have mastered all aspects of a wide and complicated subject like emergence. Indeed, I have my own list of important names in the area of which he seems to be unaware, including Chris Langton (artificial life), John Conway (game of life), Donald Hebb (cell assemblies in the brain), Manfred Eigen (hypercycles in proto-biology,  Lev Landau (polaron), Warren McCulloch and Warren Pitts (logical theory of the brain), Thomas Kuhn (scientific revolutions), William James (nature of religious conversion), the list goes on. 
<br />
<br />If you know nothing about emergence but would like to experience the excitement of researchers in this emerging area,you will enjoy and profit from reading this well written book. Be warned, however, that the subject is much larger that Steven Johnson yet imagines.

                    <span>Emergence is a field that is trying to come to grips with how new behavior emerges out of smaller units. For example, there is no gene for a hive of bees or colony of ants, but the behavior of the nest emerges from them. Some people are using cellular automata as a means of explaining higher order behavior (like Wolfram in A New Kind of Science). 
<br />
<br />The author makes a point that there are 3 main camps of scientific study. 
<br />1 - the study of simple systems - 2 or 3 variables, like electromagnetism, or celestial mechanics. 
<br />2 - the study of stochastic systems - few million to few billion variables, like actuarial sciences and genetics. 
<br />3 - the study of disorganized complexity. Systems in the middle between 3 and a few million, where the second order characteristics - how they interact, is of primary concern. 
<br />
<br />Deduction and induction work for the first 2 camps, but for the 3rd, the interactions cause actions and reactions which are what scientists politely call counter intuitive, meaning your first thought is wtf!!!??? Or, in other words, it behaves quite differently from what your instincts and (so called) common sense would tell you. 
<br />
<br />There are 5 basic principles for developing a system (or simulation of one) which can express emergent behavior. 
<br />1 - More is different. You get a very different behavior of the system when certain thresholds are reached. 
<br />2 - Ignorance is useful. Ants communicate with a vocabulary of around 20 words/ideas. 
<br />3 - Encourage random encounters. Much of the behavior of an ant colony comes from them just bumping into each other (or external things like food, or my foot). 
<br />4 - Look for patterns in the signs. Even with the limited vocabulary of ants, they can also express things based on the decay in the pheromones they deposit. 
<br />5 - Pay attention to your neighbors. Also described as "local information can lead to global wisdom." 
<br />
<br />The economist Jane Jacobs had been studying things like this for years, and has been demonized by a number of loud, vocal economists: they want to believe in some centralized controlling force (like tax rate or central bank lending rate), control that force, and you control the development of your economic system. People reading her books tend to think she worships sidewalks, instead, she values the communication that can only happen on sidewalks. You can't say "hi" to your neighbors if you are each zipping past each other on the freeway. 
<br />
<br />One can experiment with emergent behavior with some software tools. The author explains a few, of which you are most likely to have experience with SimCity. 
<br />
<br />Most memorable quote: 
<br />[Marvin] Minsksy scanned the screens for a few seconds, then asked Resnick what he was working on. "I explained that I was experimenting with some self-organizing systems. Minsky looked at the screen for a while, then said, 'but those creatures aren't self organizing. They're just moving toward the green food.'" 
<br />
<br />"Minksy had assumed that the green blobs were pieces of food placed throughout the turtles' world. In fact the green blobs were created by the turtles themselves. But Minsky didn't see it that way. Instead of seeing creatures organizing themselves, he saw the creatures organized around pieces of food..." 
<br />
<br />Minsky had fallen for the myth of the ant queen: the assumption that collective behaviot implied some kind of centralized authority - in this case the food was dictating the behavior of the slime mold cells. Minsky assumed that you could predict where the clusters would form by looking at where the food was placed when the simulation began. But there wasn't any food. Nor was there anything dictating that clusters should form in specific locations. The slime molds were self organizing, albeit with parameters that Resnick had initially designed. 
<br />
<br />"Minsky has thought more, and more deeply, about self organization and decentralized systems than almost anyone else," Resnick writes. "When I explained the rules underlying the slime mold program to him, he understood immediately what was happening. But his initial assumption was revealing. The fact that even Marvin Minsky had this reaction is an indicator of the powerful attraction of centralized explanations.  
<br />(pp 167-168) 
<br />
<br />One of the enduring myths we have is that of the Ant Queen. The myth supposes that there is some central planning done in an ant colony. Instead, the queen exists only to pop eggs out. Male ants have such short lives, that in most species of ants, they have no mouths to eat with - they don't live long enough to get hungry. The production of warriors and workers is done by pheromones in the colony. Where to gather food is performed by random acts of bumping into things. There is no ant which tells another to go lift that bale and tote that barge. It also appears that our intelligence is a by-product of the neural interactions of our brains. 
<br />
<br />The main difference between chaos theory and emergent behavior theory lies in a couple important differences. A chaotic system has a number of determinable feedback loops, all of which are (usually critically) dependant upon the starting conditions. Emergent behavior has more to do with feedback loops causing totally different behavior, and when some threshhold (usually population) is passed, the nature of the system drastically changes.</span>

<br />Is emergence a true phenomonon outside of personal experience or a cognitive adaptation solely within personal experience?
<br />
<br />This work is a finely told tale of the phenomenon of emergent behavior. How things develop to form something complex not readily apparent from its constituent parts or beginnings. Steven Johnson is thorough, appealing, and clear in his writing. I found this work interesting and engaging. I recommend it to all.
<br />
<br />My one criticism of this book is a personal one, not one of error on the author's part. I found this work to be too personality driven. It felt to me to be too much about individual characters and less about ideas. In fact, I think if the actual ideas were distilled from this work the amount would be less than the book suggests. Even with that said, I still think this is a valuable and insightful work.</span>

                    <span>As a researcher who studies dynamic systems, the topic of emergent properties is very much of interest to me. The first thing I thought when I read the book was how it applied to so many different phenomena in life. Societies, economies, even psychology and the soul. Yes, the soul - it seems reasonable to me that if we are to postulate the concept of a soul for each of us, could we not look at it as an *emergent* property of our brains? Emergent phenomenon explain much in biology, neurology, genetics and immunology. Give a system many interacting parts, some relatively simple rules for interaction, and voila - a system that behaves in a complex manner despite the underlying simplicity. This book is highly accessible to the layperson and I recommend it to everyone looking for general, guiding principles in understanding life and behavior - including our own. Just read the book and think about how it applies to so many different things. Especially recommended for philosophers and scientists.</span>

                    <span>Emergence is when simple elements self organize to form very sophisticated higher level behavior.  You do not have to be an information expert to enjoy reading Emergence by Steven Johnson.  He has a knack for describing complicated systems in an understandable way.
<br />
<br />	He compares self organizing behaviors of ants, complex video games, the brain, online communities, cities and slime mode to name a few.  The author explains the similarities in a way that the reader ends up with a really extensive understanding of how these bottom up systems form.  He discussed in detail how emergence is affecting the Internet.  Will computers ever become self-aware?  Will they ever learn to think for themselves?  After reading this book, it is clear to me if they ever do emergence will definitely be involved.
<br />
<br />	Steven Johnston wrote a lot about cities and how their emergent behavior creates a well-organized society.  For instance most large cities similar distinct areas like gay and affluent neighborhoods.  How do these areas form out of millions of individuals?  It is amazing if you stop to think about it.  It is all part self-organizing, many individuals interacting to form our great cities.  Much of this interaction is too difficult to explain but it is fun to think about.
<br />
<br />The book is also filled with interesting history and abstract ideas and facts.  I never knew that every ant colony has a graveyard and a trash dump!  More interestingly they are strategically placed on opposite ends, furthest away from the colony. 
<br />
<br />This book makes me think about what is in store for our future.  It is exciting and a little scary.  Will computers form some type of global brain?  It is impossible to know what will happen because part of emergence is giving up control and seeing what happens.  Fascinating book!
