                <span id="Label1"><P>Master the principles of object-oriented programming as it is used with the most recent version of ActionScripting.</P><P>This book is designed to provide readers with an understanding of object-oriented programming, ActionScript 2.0, and the interaction of the two. Section 1 begins with an introduction to ActionScript 2.0 and the specifics of building classes in AS2. Other topics of discussion include adding properties and methods to classes, inheritance, interfaces, inter-object communications, the details and implications of object-oriented design as a process, and working with and building components. Section 2 investigates the server side of applications. In the new Rich Internet Application paradigm, Flash MX 2004 is used as the user interface to an Internet based Client-Server application, and we will frequently need to interact with other server based technologies. Chapters discuss the importance of the server model; specific methods to interact with different server side technologies, including WebServices, XML files, and even simple text files; and the specific ramifications of working with the Flash Communication Server. Section 3 ties all of the concepts presented in the first two sections together by building a single cohesive application. Step-by-step procedures for conceptualizing and building the application are provided along with detailed coverage of how to debug and optimize the application. </P></span>

                    <span>I got this book to learn more about OOP style programming and for the most part that what it does. If you really want to have a good primer for actionscript oop programming this is the book. The down side to the book is all the errors and the section with the XML does not give all the code you need for the drop-down menus (unless you download the fla). If you are not great at debugging the author's code, be prepare to be frustrated and disappointed. I can't give this book a high rating because of all the errors but for reference alone and coverage on basic OOP structure I have to give it 5 stars. Anything after chapter 5 its slim picking for good and valuable code. Maybe Jeff Tapper should have waited to write the book after Collin Moock put out his so he can see how to write good code. With that aside the book is uh....ok.</span>

                    <span>This book has the MOST amount of technical and coding errors I've seen in an ActionScript book in a long time (not the worst--ISBN: 0072222662).<P>I've tech-edited two other Flash books and I'm thinking the tech-editors of this book should learn ActionScript before they attempt to tech-edit their next book. Or at least read it before sending it off.<P>They just had to come out with this book before Colin Moock came out with his or else no one would buy it.<P>The Author, Jeff Tapper, is sick of getting emails about how bad this book is and he said it was a fiasco from start to finish so I'm thinking some marketing jerkwad rushed the book out the door.<BR>More bad desicions in the marketing department end up wasting some more time and trees. <P>Save your money.</span>

                    <span>A needed book that offers valuable information. It's unfortunate that there are so many typos but its really the only book I have found that treats ActionScript like a real programming language and seems to make a conscious effort to avoid most of the visual aspects of Flash that had really confused me before. I need to learn ActionScript 2 and don't need to worry about building animations or the like. It's been very useful as a reference. <P>Overall, a great book and really there is nothing else like it out there. Be forewarned that there are heaps of typos, and some code snippets don't work.</span>

                    <span>First, let me say that I think the technical editing on this book is an atrocity! It seems as though the Courier-fonted code presented in this book was cut-and-pasted from a mish-mash of sources. The formatting and even coding style differs from one listing to the next, even within essentially the same programs! I think that's terrible. It's rather difficult to learn the material when your examples are awful and full of mistakes. For shame!<P>Secondly, the book is really expensive, and a lot of the space is wasted on server technologies that many people cannot possibly afford. The typeface could be a little smaller, especially on the code, and more good stuff could be fit into the book.<P>Thirdly, the website listed on the book is WRONG! So I cannot download ANY of the code examples. Nor has New Riders / Peachpit bothered to mention this on their site. They list only TWO mistakes in their "errata," which is so wrong it's not even funny.<P>I wish that authors, and editors in particular, would put more effort into proofing a book before sending it to press. In my opinion, writing a book is not like putting out a piece of software. It's much harder to offer "patches", especially with an unwilling publisher and uncaring authors.<P>However, the material in this book is, for the most part, very good. I appreciate its timeliness very much, but I think a lot more effort should have gone into the later stages of production!</span>

                    <span>Having minimum Flash/AS1 experience, but years of web dev (javascript/css/etc) experience I found this book to be an excellent launching pad. The first three chapters summerized the new syntax very nicely. Its not a language reference, but still very useful and inspiring. Even gets into OO design priciples and an example OO project.</span>
