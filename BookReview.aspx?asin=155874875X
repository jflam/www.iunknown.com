                <span id="Label1"><P>For pure exhilaration and drama, there's nothing quite like sports: It's the crack of the bat as it connects with the baseball, hurtling it into the bleachers for a home run; the swish of the basketball as it drops into the net for a three-point play at the buzzer; the roar of the crowd as the quarterback delivers a perfect spiral pass for the winning touchdown. Most importantly, sports bring out the best in the human spirit. There is an intensity and a richness inherent in every sporting experience that amplifies our emotions and our connection with the moment and, indeed, with ourselves.</P>  <P>This latest collection of <I>Chicken Soup</I> honors all that is good in the world of sports. From major leaguers to little leaguers, from hockey stars to figure skaters, and from horseracing to mushing, the stories in this book highlight the positive and transformative nature of sports. Readers will come to see sports as one of our most important and powerful teachers. They can teach us to focus and stay the course, or to develop a new strategy and rededicate ourselves to a goal. They can teach us to be humble in victory and gracious in defeat. They can teach us the importance of teamwork and remind us that we must strive to give our individual all. At their best, sports will build us up and they will wear us down; they will build character and teach us to overcome adversity.</P>  <P>This book is for anyone who has ever enjoyed watching or participating in any sport, from the professional athlete to the weekend warrior, from the soccer mom to the diehard sports fan, from the marathon runner to the neighborhood jogger. </P></span>

                    <span>"Chicken Soup For The Sports Fans Soul" is a phenomenal book. It tells many stories including goof ups, sports stars who have done great things for other people, and just about every headline story in the world of sports. It is a very inspirational book. One of my favorite stories was when a team takes one of their players out of the hospital when he is lying in his bed so he could celebrate a victory. I recommend this book to any person interested in sports. The sports in this book range from golf to rugby. The writers of this book including Jack Canfield are all great. <BR> I will tell you the truth though. Some people will agree that some of the stories are a little boring. If you like "Chicken Soup for the Sports Fan's Soul", I suggest you read "Chicken Soup For The Baseball Fans Soul". If you do read "Chicken Soup For The Sports Fans Soul" I know you will love it. I rated this book 5 stars and I think you will too. Go get it now.</span>

                    <span>At least the diversity of sports used in this tape kept my attention and I did like some of the stories. I even learned some things that I didn't know about some sports luminaries. I wouldn't buy the tape again. Come on, Jack, get some humor in your stories and on the tape. Not everything has to be so serious.</span>

                    <span>From humorous to serious, the stories contained in this book are well worth reading. Some of the stories are written by the athletes themselves, others by the journalists who covered them, and still others by the everyday sports lover no one has ever heard of outside the communities in which they play and coach. This book covers virtually every sport from little league to the Olympics and professionals, although my four star rating rather than five is a result of the fact that only one soccer and one or two hockey stories appear in the book. Notwithstanding the lack of coverage of my two favorite sports, however, this book made me laugh aloud, and made tears well in my eyes as an athlete, a coach, and a father. The book is worth buying if only for the quotations that precede several of the chapters. Overall, it is a book that can be read in one sitting, or a story at a time; either way, it will inspire and delight anyone who loves sports, and the best and worst in all of us they evoke.</span>
