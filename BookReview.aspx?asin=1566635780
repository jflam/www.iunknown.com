                    <span>This book is an excellent primer for any parent who has a child that pitches. Carroll provides valuable insights into where coaches, players, and parents go wrong.  His research is well done.  If more people read this book we would not have so many young kids having Tommy John surgery.</span>

                    <span>A book like this could be dangerous for inexperienced pitchers.  Mr. Carroll is not a physician or trainer.<br>I strongly recommend you consult a professional if you plan on using his drills.</span>

                    <span>This book has the potential to change the face of baseball, if only everyone would take the time to read it.  The fact that so many teams still do not understand the basic principles laid forth in this book is downright sad.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>While Mr. Carroll is not a doctor nor an athletic trainer - hs has a skill set that is unmatched in modern baseball.  He has a network of connections in MLB that makes his online column a must-read, he is a good writer and has a tremendous knowledge of the history of sports medicine.  <p>These skills come forth in this book.  It's a quick read that is accessible to fans and useful to coaches and players.  The chapter on Velocity Loss shows how mindless fans like myself can see when a player is truly fatiguing on the hill.<p>I found this book to be interesting, informative and one of the top baseball books released this year.  I would love to see my favorite team apply a lot of things that Will recommends here and even try the 4-man rotation out. <p>A great first book, Mr. Carroll, I look forward to number two.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Mr. Carroll does a marvelous job assembling and disseminating the evolving body of knowledge on this topic in a manner which is accessible and engaging.  Contrary to the statements made by another recent reviewer, Mr. Carroll _does_ have a background in sports medicine.  He relies up on this, but never loses sight of his audience.  <p>This book is invaluable reading for both experts and neophytes alike.  Few areas are more misunderstood than the health and training of pitchers, and knowledge of and adherence to the principles espoused by Carroll and his subjects would go a long way toward improving pitchers' health and the overall quality of baseball.  <p>If you love baseball, read it.</span>
