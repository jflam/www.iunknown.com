                <span id="Label1">Without Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), network  administrators might have to actually get out of their chairs and go  see what's up with all of the network-connected equipment under their  authority. Perish the thought. <I>Essential SNMP</I> explains how the  management protocol works and how it's implemented by several operating  systems and pieces of equipment. More importantly, this book shows its  reader--who should be a network administrator who's familiar with the  problems of running a distributed network--how SNMP can earn its place  as a network administration tool. In other words, this book examines  SNMP as a strategic resource as well as a technical  phenomenon.<p>Because it's oriented toward SNMP as a tool, much of the  coverage in this book has to do with software that uses SNMP to provide  network monitoring and control services. After a  strengths-and-weaknesses overview of a number of SNMP packages, the  authors use mainly HP OpenView, Castle Rock SNMPc, and Net-SNMP (the  last in combination with Perl scripting) to demonstrate how SNMP works  and how to take advantage of it. It's the scripting that really  distinguishes this book from other SNMP books, by the way. It's  integral to the authors' presentation, and the latter half of this book  is packed with shell and Perl listings. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and  its applicability as a network management tool. Details like object  identifiers (OIDs), management information bases (MIBs), traps, and  community strings are defined and explained. The configuration of SNMP  agents is detailed for several software packages and operating systems,  and the integration of SNMP and scripts (in shell languages and in  Perl) is covered nicely.</span>

                    <span>I was transferred to Manage a networking group in my company knowing barely the basics about SNMP. This book was a fantastic tool for me! I rely on it heavily. This book has enabled me to take monitoring to the next level. The only problem I seem to have with the book is keeping it on my desk. All the network analysts constantly are using it. Thanks Doug and Kevin for allowing me to excel to a higher level.....</span>

                    <span>I came into this book knowing basically nothing about SNMP, and now I feel like an expert. The authors really know their stuff, and they convey it in a relaxed, personal manner that makes what could have been a dry subject entertaining as well as informative. Mauro and Schmidt have rich tech writing careers ahead of them. I couldn't recommend this book more strongly.</span>

                    <span>I personally know Douglas Mauro and can attest to his expertise on SNMP. Having worked with Doug on an HP OpenView project, I was impressed by his knowledge of SNMP and his skills on OpenViews collections, filters and maps.<P>SNMP is known by many and understood by few. Doug and Kevin have done an exceptional job of presenting this topic with vivid and useful examples. I have referred to this book many times in designing network management systems for clients.<P>I highly recommend this book to people leaning about networking (aka CCNA) to full fledge network engineers</span>

                    <span>This book is intended for people wanting to understand how to use SNMP such as adminstrators or managers. I bought this book because of its coverage of various NMS systems (such as HP OpenView NNM) and SNMP Agents.<P>The book provides coverage of SNMP and its operation in two chapters. It covers NMS configuration, Agent configuration, extensible Agents, MRTG. Also useful is its coverage of open source software for SNMP: Net-SNMP, SNMP Perl module, and MRTG. <P>The book could use more coverage of other open source and freely available SNMP software.<P>All in all, a good book. As usual, you can trust O'Reilly.</span>
