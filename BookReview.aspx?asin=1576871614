                    <span>If you are a sneaker fiend this book is a must.<p>Scoop Jackson does a great job documenting the history of Nike's basketaball sneakers. Its mainly a picture book, which is pretty good for reference and features, in addition to photos of just about every Nike basketball sneaker ever produced, classic posters and athlete photos.<p>If you are looking for a comprehensive biography of Nike's history in this field, this isn't the book for you</span>

                    <span>I gave this book to my boyfriend for his birthday.  He collects shoes, mostly nike.  He saw an ad in one of his basketball magazines for this book and didn't just want it, he NEEDED it.  He got the book and couldn't put it down.  He also wanted to see a picture of the new Jordan's coming out in 2003 and was disappointed when they weren't in the book.  But he took off the hard back cover protector and saw that it is on the hard cover.  He was very excited and thought that was pretty cool how they tried to keep it on the downlow.  The book also has drawings of the shoes before they become final, it is neat to see how the evolve into the final shoe. All in all great layout and a great book.</span>
