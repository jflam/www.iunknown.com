                <span id="Label1">Even though Americans spend thousands on furniture, appliances and interior decoration, many of our homes have become little more than drop-off zones where we collapse after work, glued to the TV while gulping down a microwave dinner.<P> The home can be so much more than that, says Victoria Moran. It can be a haven in which people can revitalize mind, body and soul. That's what <I>Shelter for the Spirit</I> is all about. Merging Eastern and Western spiritual traditions with a sensitivity to the demands of modern life, it provides people with usable directions for bringing a sense of peace and renewal to their homes. Whether addressing how to get rid of clutter, decorate in a way that respects your personality, clean house as a spiritual exercise or celebrate special days (and ordinary ones too), <I>Shelter for the Spirit</I> shows how the quality of attention we give to everyday acts can transform our lives. The only book of its kind, it helps all readers make their homes places in which they and their guests enjoy spending their moments.</span>

                    <span>I went to the bookstore looking for interior deisgn books but I ended up with this book instead. It is much more than how to create space you feel comfortable in -- it is helpful ideas about how to create a home in whatever space you live in. The book also includes advice on how to enjoy everyday tasks -- like cleaning, etc. What a breath a fresh air. I didn't need any interior design books after reading this book. I create my own ideas.<P>Ann Marie M. Andrews<BR>West Harrison, NY</span>

                    <span>I got this on tape from the library, and she reads it herself-- it was the most awesome book I ever read (had read to me!) last year! I still haven't topped it this year. I am so impressed, I really loved it. I recommeded that out LLL group get it for our library. We are a homeschooling family, and because we spend so much time in our home (we are like soccer moms, but all day long, in and out, stuff all over!), so the clutter drives me nuts sometimes. Knowing that she too was a homeschooling mom (and single parent at that-- brave mom!) it made me feel better that she could know true clutter and still find her home to be a haven. I would reccomend this as tops to anyone. Good job to the author!</span>

                    <span>I feel like this book has changed me and changed my life - for the better! This book is exactly what I needed in my life at this moment. Victoria Moran has written more than a "how to keep house" book here - she has written a book that can help each of us fully enjoy our lives. She gives wonderful insight on things we can do to change our lives from hectic, frantic, and stressed out to serene and full of joy. Her suggestions are all "DO-able" suggestions - requiring nothing more major than a change of attitude. I am so grateful to Ms. Moran for writing this book - it has touched me deeply and I feel that my life will be much more appreciated from now on. I plan to sit down and re-read this book every year or so from now on to remind myself of what is REALLY important and to keep my priorities in line. <P>I loved this book so much that I just purchased eight copies to give every single one of my best girlfriends & treasured family members - I wish I could buy a copy for everyone in the whole world!</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed this book a great deal but read it after I had tackled some other books dealing with homemaking and simplifying your life. The author gives a great overview of how crazy our lives have become and some good general ideas for setting a more sane pace in our homes. I think I was looking for more specific ideas, like those in Home Comforts, by Cheryl Mendelsohn, but this book reinforced the ideas that started me on this path a few months ago. I very much want to pass it on to some friends who have lost sight of the importance of home. I think a great follow-up, for anyone interested, would be Simple Abundance by Sara Ban Breathnach (spelling?). She provides specific actions and steps you can take over the course of a year to achieve the goals Victoria Moran outlines in Shelter.</span>

                    <span>i bought this book thinking this was, yet another, organization book that would turn me from disorganized to organized. .....but it wasn't....it was truly inspiring! no it did not tell me how to organize specific things...like other books. it told me how to make a "home". it told me how to separate the necessary from the unessary belongings in my life. there were spiritual messages but not from one dogma. the author uses suggstions from many cultures for u to choose what works for you. its a truly beautiful book with many beautiful ideas. just reading it made me feel good.</span>
