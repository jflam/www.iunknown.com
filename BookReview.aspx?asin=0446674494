                    <span>After reading enthusiastic reviews I bought this and the Conceptual Selling book. A basic premise is the salesperson's ability to ask questions, and not just talk. Maybe this is a revelation for someone new to sales, but as I kept reading I found this book just restating the obvious. I've been in sales for 25 years, and this book is nothing new. Catchy title, they obviously have a lot of big name clients. Good book for a rookie though, but an insult to veteran salespeople.</span>

                    <span>I read this book to prepare myself for a salescourse at the company where I work. As it turns out I am no salesman, but the trainer did note that I had a very good insight into the salesprocess. So good, in fact, that he advised me to become a selling consultant for my company instead of a salesman. All that, thanks to having read this book in combination with "The New Strategic Selling" (also by Heiman). If you really want to start selling, you must read this book!</span>

                    <span>Throw the old rules of traditional sales out the window. Stephen E. Heiman and his co-authors, Diane Sanchez and Tad Tuleja, state in no uncertain terms that to remain a successful sales professional, you need to change the way you view the selling process. They advocate a customer-driven model of sales as the only approach for long-term success. The book includes &#8220;personal workshops&#8221; to allow you to apply these concepts directly to your sales situation. We ...recommend this book to anyone frustrated by the limitations of product-pitch selling. Note: This book is a revision of Conceptual Selling (by Robert Bruce Miller with Heiman and Tuleja, Warner Books, 1987), which has been updated to reflect the economy of today and tomorrow.</span>

                    <span>This was another fantastic book by the same people who brought you Strategic Selling. It provides the blocking and tackling of sales situations that fills out the strategic approach of their earlier book. <P>This is a professional, mature approach to selling that is sadly rare in the profession.</span>
