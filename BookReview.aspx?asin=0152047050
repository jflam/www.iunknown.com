                    <span>This book is awesome! I liked it because it was filled with mystery and it's hook was really awesome -- it grabbed me right off. I think anyone over 9 who likes Wrinkle in Time (Madeline L'Engle), So you Want to Be A Wizard (Diane Duane), or other books like that will definitely like this book. This book will keep you wanting more; you'll be sorry when it's done. I hope there's a sequel!</span>

                    <span>Anthony and his younger sister, Sarah, have always dreamed of seeing what Morley Manor holds within it's walls. Of course, everyone in the small town of Owl's Roost, Nebraska, has the same idea. So when Old Man Morley dies, and Morley Manor is bought by a demolition team, everyone in Owl's Roost attends the sale, seeing as everything held under the roof of Morley Manor must go. Anthony has no intention of purchasing anything at the sale, but when Sarah shows him a strange looking box, that she convinces him would be absolutely perfect to hold his trading cards, he realizes that he's never wanted anything so much, and decides to buy it. Once home he breaks open the lock, and finds that the box houses five little monsters. However, Anthony soon finds out that placing any of the five monsters (Ludmilla, Albert, Gaspar, Melisande, and Bob) in water, brings them to life. And bringing them to life, will bring the monsters, Anthony, and Sarah, on all sorts of wild adventures to save the Earth as we know it.<P>Bruce Coville has created a novel for middle readers (ages 9-12), that will hold their interest, and keep them begging for more, even after their done reading it. The characters of THE MONSTERS OF MORLEY MANOR are exciting, and all have their own quirky personalities, that readers will relish in. Fans of Madeleine L'Engle's TIME QUARTET will find that the adventures that Anthony and Sarah take part in with the monsters, are much like the adventures that Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace experience in each of the books in L'Engle's TIME QUARTET. A must-have book for all fans of mystery, paranormal phenomena, and science fiction. You won't be disappointed with THE MONSTERS OF MORLEY MANOR.<P>Erika Sorocco</span>

                    <span>The Monsters of Morley Manor is an excellent book for young readers and old readers alike. I didn't find a lot of books I wanted to read, but my Mom suggested I read this book and it was like a magic portal to reading land. It was exciting the whole time -- it didn't have a long, slow beginning like some books. It had wonderful characters with great personalities and there is so much spine-tingling adventure in it. If I could have given it more stars, I would give it a million.</span>

                    <span>I read this wonderful book called The Monsters of Morley Manor by Bruce Coville. It's about a boy named Anthony and his sister Sarah, who finds a box in Morley Manor. Once he did it with every monster, he tried to help them save Morley Manor. What I liked about the book is the mystery. I think every reader should read this book because it's interesting and mysterious.</span>
