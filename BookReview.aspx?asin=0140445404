                    <span>Wendy Doniger, the "translator," of Manu calls the book "evil". Well, you won't confuse her as a cultural or moral relativist. She is quite happy to call attention to 'backwards' India from her Judeo-Christian ivory tower. Only buy this "translation" is you would also consider being taught Torah by an anti-semite. </span>

                    <span>The book was supposed to be a translation, but the author has ended up publishing her biases in the garb of presenting it in narrative form. A quick search on the author reveals that she is a controversial character and that Encarta removed her contribution after investigating her scholarship. 
<br />
<br />As someone interested in learning about Hinduism, I was looking for someone who could just give me the facts instead of a polemicist. The book was a huge disappointment. I wish I had known about Encarta yanking her piece on the grounds of poor scholarship before I embarked on reading her "translation."</span>

                    <span>Wendy Doniger has done a disservice to an important Hindu work. She has misinterpreted the work in important passages. 
<br />
<br />Poor showing Wendy!</span>

                    <span>Wendy doniger has recently received a lot of flak for her so called "research". For the past 2 decades she virtually ruled the field of indology unchallenged. With the emergence of a new set of Indian scholars who have disputed the various premises of her work, Doniger has been caught o the back foot. An obessive desire to interpret virtually every fable or fact of hinduism using freud's psyco-analytical theories brings to light truely ridiculous conclusions. It is a well known fact that the Manu-smriti is not the final say of indian laws and opinions. People who do not know the difference between strutis and smritis should not have the arrogance to project hinduism in less than factual ways. For authoritative studies on indology read books by carl jung and Rajiv Malhotra. Doniger's books will only satisfy your appetite for tabloidy scandalous reports on hinduism.</span>

                    <span>The shortcomings of Doniger's general Indological scholarship have been detailed by Michael Witzel and Rajiv Malhotra. This book suffers from the same flaws. The translations are idiosyncratic, and she is obsessed with finding sex, even in situations that none is called for.</span>
