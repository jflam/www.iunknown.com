                    <span>This book is an amazing introduction to Typology. I started reading it and could not put it down. There is so much useful information in this book that can only help you when you have dealings with others. It can also help you learn a great deal about yourself. The authors pointed out that was the main purpose of this book.<p>For example is was able to determine that I am a INFP. I also learned that it's very uncommon to be an INFP, being a male. I was also able to learn what types of work envoirnments I work well in, what types of careers people with my type are attracted too, what other types I correspond with best, and much more. Also finding out that all of my poor Introverted people were persecuted for being so quiet, and often recieved constant day-to-day pressure to get out and be normal (so I'm not alone). Not realizing that this behavior could not be more normal.<p>This book is a very easy and enjoyable read. Everything is well organized and laid out. The authors use alot of conversation examples between different personality types, often a riot to read, it also makes a point about different types of people, which really helped me the most. This book has so much to offer, everybody can benefit greatly from it.</span>

                    <span>Have you ever walked into a co-workers office and asked them a question as they first look at you with a glazed look, and then ask you to repeat the question?  Have you dealt with a people who take forever to answer anything?  How about trying to understand individuals who seem to be somewhat unfocused and a bit scattered in their conversation?<p>The book Type Talk is a great introduction to understanding the personality make up of these types of people and basically everyone else.<p>This book breaks down the 16 Myers Briggs Types to come up with an introduction to individuals who want to know why people do the things they do.<p>For individuals who know types through the MBTI, this book will assist you in understanding the type of almost anyone you talk with, and be able to relate better with them.  For someone who has not been through the MBTI, this book will allow you to be introduced to personality types without animal names, colors or something that sounds like a sickness (phlegmatic....ahem....)<p>You will come to understand and reflect on how someone who tends to be more Introverted or Extroverted, Sensing or iNtuitive, Thinking or Feeling, Judging or Perceiving and how a combination of the above will determine how people tend to relate to the people in their lives, how they approach life in general and daily.<p>This book could help everyone to understand the world we live in.<p>One thing though, don't put people in a box.  If someone is considered one of the 16 types, that is not a box they are in, that is the reference they usually feel most comfortbably working from.<p>Thuesen and Kroeger bring together their years of research and have a lot of documentation for back up and instruction.<p>A must book if you are in Human Resources, Training or Education or if you love the differences that make up the human race.</span>

                    <span>The descriptions of the types are great. This is very well written and most informative. I recommend it most definitely and wish the inefficient, one-size-fits-all obsolete psych of the education system could get thrown out in favor of this more practical psych system.<br>The only place the Otto and Janet missed the boat completely is where they try and guess famous people's types: they are nearly always off base, strangely.</span>

                    <span>I work in the field of Leadership Development and the two assessment tests we use are the MBTI and the Gallup StrengthsFinder.  The MBTI is great for learning preferences and type, and how someone will act in public.  This book, 'Type Talk," does an excellent job of working through all the types and preferences, whether Extrovert/Introvert Intuitive/Sensing Thinking/Feeling or Judging/Perceiving, this book does it all.  It makes sense, it is easy to read, and will get you on the road to understanding the world of Myers-Briggs a whole lot better.  Overall Grade, A.<p>Joseph Dworak</span>

                    <span>After over 10 years of studying and using the MBTI in corporate and not for profit work, I have found Otto and Janet's books most useful.  Their writing is non-judgemental and very acurate.  There are many useful "job aids" throughout that give excellent tips in areas like communication, conflict, etc...  They explain type through stories and experiences that illustrate meaning behind the model.  I have not found better authors on the subject of MBTI.</span>
