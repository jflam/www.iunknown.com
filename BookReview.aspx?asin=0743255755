                <span id="Label1">Veteran political strategist James Carville has always had a knack for being concise. He is, after all, credited with coining "It's the economy, stupid" while directing the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton. And as host of CNN's <I>Crossfire</I>, he favored a combative in-your-face approach that stood in stark contrast to the stereotype of the mushy liberal. In <I>Had Enough</I>, Carville, along with co-author Jeff Nussbaum, takes that economic phrasing and aggressive style to offer a handbook for lefties tired of losing arguments and elections. To point out how fundamentally misguided he believes the GOP to be, Carville goes straight to the preamble to the U.S. Constitution. While Republicans can be credited with providing for the common defense, Carville says, they have failed miserably on all other directives issued by the founding fathers on what government is supposed to do, including promoting the general welfare, establishing justice, ensuring domestic tranquility, and securing the blessings of liberty for ourselves and posterity. Although the arguments are not remarkably different from those made in a slew of other lefty books (Bush's tax cuts favor the rich, Republicans seek to curtail civil liberties), the book also offers "Had Enough" solutions to pressing issues of public policy that will come in handy for liberals looking to defeat a conservative brother-in-law in a political argument or even hold their own on <I>Crossfire</I>. These solutions always sound eminently reasonable, although that's due in large part to their being contrasted to Carville's interpretation of Bush and company's approach ("Use everything as an excuse to dig, drill, and burn.") Still, Carville and Nussbaum make a cogent, impassioned, and highly entertaining indictment of the Bush administration, which, combined with a smattering of incongruously placed but nonetheless tempting Cajun recipes, makes <I>Had Enough</I> a worthwhile read. <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>I read this book straight through from front to back.  It was asbolutely amazing.  the Ragin' Cajun makes his points easy to understand and doesn't over-do it with political mumbo jumbo that the regular joe can't understand.  
<br />
<br />Whether you are a liberal or Neo-con everyone should read it.  It brings up valid points with great evidence.  By far Carville's best book.</span>

                    <span>Like the title of my review says, I love you James, even though I'm probably young enough to be your granddaughter (I just turned 21).
<br />
<br />Ever since I've become politically active (I didn't get to vote in the 2000 election), I've watched you on Cable, and you make the points about how horrible this Bushwacker is so clearly and down to earth that even someone new to politics like me can understand the complicated nature of it all. I went to every demonstration and Democratic rally I could down here in Florida. It is sad that it was all for nothing.
<br />
<br />This book continues that plain, truthful speech, only in much more detail. I understood the inner workings of politics and the corruption of that by "Dick" Cheney and Carl Rove, the real Co-Presidents of the United States, so much further after reading this book.
<br />
<br />This book is a must read for anyone who hates what Bush is doing to us and is still part of the peaceful, but forceful, resistance. The only book I suggest even more is Bill Jabanoski's SCARECROW because it not only explains what James Carville does, it leaves you in tears with its graphic reporting on the cost in REAL human lives that Cheney, Rove, and their frontman Bush have caused and now will keep causing.
<br />
<br />Please. I'm 21. I want to have children someday. I want the same chance that those of you who are older than me had, until four years ago, to live my life in a Free country that doesn't treat justice like it's a joke, deliberately destroys the environment, and can't wait for the next war. Please. Read this book and Jabanoski's. Please don't stop resisting. </span>

                    <span>It's amazing how most of the bad reviews of this book are an attack on James Carville's character rather than the contents of the book itself.  With that said, this book will is an eye opener on everything that has gone wrong in the past four years.  Take a look at the various timelines that describe how Bush blocks funding for the Department of Homeland Security.  Take a look at the timeline for all the international treaties we've backed out of and why the NATO countries are not coming to our aid.  Carville lays out the problem, the (ineffective) administration's response, and proposes a solution.  It's book like this that make me wonder how many American people realize that Kerry voted to for a DIFFERENT bill that would fund the troops by taking back the tax cuts from the richest 2% in the U.S.  Why not have the richest 2% fund the soldiers in Iraq instead of the combined lower, middle, and upper classes?  Think about this: If you combine the lower and middle classes in the U.S. they outnumber the richest upper class (say the ones that make over $200K a year).  Why not offer all these hard workers a tax break and raise taxes for the richest 2%?  Carville will inspire this kind of rational thinking while providing great recipes for food at the same time.  He will inspire Democrats to take on the Republicans on issues and hopefully inspire readers to look beyond what's covered in the media.  None of us have time to watch/record CSPAN 24/7.  It's refreshing to have some of the major events summarized for us.</span>

                    <span>As a conservative I found much to disagree with in this book, however, that doesn't mean it wasn't well written and even entertaining in places.  I'll even go so far as to say that I enjoyed reading Carville more than I did Hannity, however, I don't agree with nearly all of the positions of the former and do agree with most of the positions of the later so my rating is based on writing style and information not the policies espoused.  I believe that conservatives should read this book and I give it a high recommendation to those that are in positions that a more through knowledge of the other sides positions would be helpful.
<br />
<br />Now as to the specifics of the book and the things I liked and disliked.
<br />
<br />First, I liked the actual lay out of the book (something of an outline form that stayed consistent issue to issue).  And I felt I had a good grasp of  how Carville believes the country should be run and why he hates George Bush so much.  He actually made reference to lynching Bush, but said he couldn't go that far because "Mary would make me sleep on the couch."
<br />
<br />Now I think it's important to understand why liberals hate conservatives like Bush so much because understanding that hatred, to some degree at least, will help those of us that are conservatives to better explain how our positions are superior and actually do a better job of securing those things that we all agree that we want, like strong national security, a strong economy and a clean environment.  Yes, conservatives, despite the rhetoric from the left, don't want their kids playing in acid rain or drinking toxic water either.  I think conservatives can read this book and actually gain strength in their knowledge that can be used to help defeat the left, which, in my opinion, is currently one of conservative Americas most important challenges.
<br />
<br />Secondly I'd like to point out the weaknesses I found here while trying not to get into the position of merely arguing my opinions on the issues, but rather, to point out how Carville has left out factual and important arguments regarding policy that, while perhaps weakening his arguments (and maybe perhaps even totally unfounded) would have made a stronger book.  I read this book to see what the other side says, and Carville gave me that, but what he didn't give readers on the left was what we conservatives actually believe, he mostly built straw men to knock down.
<br />
<br />Any disagreement on that last issue is fine, but if someone on the left wants to believe that I as a conservative believe something just because of one simple fact that Carville places in his book, and not the hundred of other facts that I also believe, hasn't really done himself much service, but, again, that's fine by me.
<br />
<br />The most glaring example of what I'm trying to explain here can be shown in how he deals with the issue of vouchers in the section on education.  Carville explains that there is this study that showed that vouchers worked, and tons of conservatives praised the study, etc.  Then the study was shown to have a major flaw, it didn't really prove that vouchers worked, so, vis a vi, conservatives are wrong and progressives are right.  The problem with this kind of logic is, or should be obvious, even without this study, there are hundreds of examples and dozens of very strong arguments in favor of vouchers.  Now, people may disagree to the validity of some or all of those arguments but that's not the point, Carville didn't include them in this book.  What he's done here is on the same level of someone saying that since the Yankees lost yesterday they have no chance of winning the series this year.
<br />
<br />When discussing tort reform, Carville quotes Bush decrying "frivolous" lawsuits then writes "Of course, by "frivolous lawsuit" he means "any lawsuit."  He then goes on to give some examples of important lawsuits that stopped industry abuses and tries to equate the conservative position on tort reform as being the same as if we conservatives want little girls to have their guts sucked out by swimming pool pumps and babies burnt to death from faulty pajamas.  This kind of reasoning may be fun to those that like to think of Bush as an evil tyrant, however, as intelligent argument goes, I find it very lacking.  I recently read an article about the shortage of ob/gyn doctors because the high cost of insurance makes entering the field less inviting, if Carville wants believe that we conservatives want real malpractice to continue and real victims to be denied relief, that's fine, but his arguments to why he believes this was lacking in my reading of this book.  As a side note, he did include a policy position I'm in agreement with regarding doctors, that being that strikes against their records should be public so that the consumer has more knowledge.  On that same line of reasoning, Carvilles' strongest points in the book come when he gives into "market" logic and then writes "conservatives can get behind me on this one."
<br />
<br />Carville has a chart on taxes that he suggests readers photo copy and pass out the next time they hear someone say taxes are too high in America.   Carville is arguing that taxes should be raised across the board because in his clever, but deceptive chart, it shows that America pays, as a percent of GNP, less in taxes than any of the other OECD countries (except for Mexico).  Like most of the arguments in this book, we are left to try and figure out all the other information that he leaves out and just trust him that because he says a chart is important, it is.  One of the issues he doesn't bring up is that Mexico has high tax rates, but because they have trouble collecting (due to the repressive rate structure), they amount of taxes they actually collect is low, thus placing them below us on his chart.  At the top of the chart, of course, are the extremely socialist countries, and if America in general were to support the progressive agenda, there we'd be as well, in short order.
<br />
<br />Besides vouchers, tort reform and taxes, Carville takes on a whole host of other issues like social security, national defense, the environment and others and my general feeling is that he handled them in similar fashion to the examples I've given above.  He gets across some color in the book, he hates Bush, still defends the Clinton sex scandal and really really hates Ken Starr.  Those asides actually made the book more entertaining.
<br />
<br />Whether or not one takes the progressive (liberal) side or the conservative side as their starting point, building straw men to knock down doesn't make a stronger argument, it would have been a better book, and more intellectually honest, to try and argue the true and more complete arguments that conservatives use for taking the positions they do.
<br />
<br />That said, I urge progressives and liberals to go out and read books written from the right, to see what arguments we actually do put forth in support of vouchers, lower taxes, less government and the like, and I urge conservatives to read this book, it was informative and instructive and I know it has helped make me a stronger conservative.
