                <span id="Label1">According to Robert J. Robinson and Mark van Osnabrugge, so-called business angels--those generally unheralded private investors who usually specialize in high-growth fields and often involve themselves directly in the endeavors they fund--now provide 30 to 40 times more financing each year than their more famous counterparts, venture capitalists. In <I>Angel Investing</I>, Robinson and Van Osnabrugge use personal interviews, anecdotal evidence, and more than 300 research studies to show exactly who these financiers are, how they operate, and where they can be found. Robinson, an international management consultant, and Van Osnabrugge, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, also compare various financing options, explain precisely how angels and venture capitalists function differently, describe proven ways to attract them, and provide relevant resources. "The vast size and power of the business angel market in the United States is not well understood but is of incredible importance to our entrepreneurial sector and, indirectly, to maintaining our economic growth and standard of living," the authors write. They pack their book accordingly with valuable information for serious fund-seekers who have exhausted the traditional three F's (founder, family, and friends), as well as those who are considering entrepreneurial investments of their own. --<I>Howard Rothman</I> </span>

                    <span>This book is one of THE BEST books on this subject matter that I have read in recent years. Having been in the venture capital industry for many years I was very interested to read what van Osnabrugge and Robinson had to say. I'll be the first to admit that I was a bit skeptical because the book was written by academics. However, after a careful read it became clear that these authors have done their homework and know what they are talking about. This book is an enjoyable read that has some of the most useful information I have found to date. I urge anyone interested in entrepreneurship and investing to read this book. You won't be sorry.</span>

                    <span>this is a comprehensive but very basic description of start up investing. if you don't know what VC stands for, this is an excellent book. however, if you have some understanding of new ventures and their finance than you won't find much of value. the authors fills 400 hundred pages with such gems as "the tough part about negotiating equity is that at the end of the day, there's only 100%". the prevalence of referenced quotes is also annoying. "whenever possible, try not to back an inflexible, one product firm" is referenced to "Gordon, 1999". is the reference, or even the thought itself, really necessary to include? any angel that needs this sort of advice should just put his money in the stock market. and why bother with the "whenever possible?" last time i chceked investing was at the discretion of the investor. this book is comprehensive, but most sections are overly simple and ignore important subtleties. if you want a much more useful, insightful and informative book, and particularly if the space you're looking at is >$10M, try "high stakes, no prisoners" by charles ferguson</span>

                    <span>I am the Founder & CEO of a business that within the next 8 to 12 months was seeking to raise between $2M and $5M to fund our expansion. I always thought of going straight to Venture Capital firms or Private Equity divisons of Invmt Banks that I have already been in touch with. This book, Angel Investing, was a truly priceless read to me. The education delivered by authors has helped me re-strategize my approach to inviting external investors and also the amount that I should try to raise and the schedule of funds. What I thought was most helpful was the detailed comparisons between Angel Investors and Venture Capitalist, as well as understanding the psychology behind their thinking and how an entrepreneur seeking outside funds should try to prepare every aspect of their presentation (themselves, their product and overall business plan). The book has given me tools to have most questions covered and more importantly has prepared me to become an angel myself in the years ahead.</span>
