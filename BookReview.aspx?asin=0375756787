                    <span>In our time, biographies of American historical figures are noticeably numerous, yet one volume stands above the rest as a supreme example of the genre: Edmund Morris's masterpiece The Rise Of Theodore Roosevelt. Perhaps it may be premature to call a book barely thirty years old a masterpiece. But the amazing scope and detail covered by Morris's study, as well as his excellent scholarship and writing, firmly place his work, which won both the American Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, in the pantheon of great biographies. At the same time, it wins the distinction of being an addictively enjoyable read, being both awe-inspiring and adventurous.
<br />
<br />	When originally written, The Rise Of Theodore Roosevelt was the first volume of a planned trilogy, covering only the years from the subject's birth to his ascent to the Presidency. But the material in Rise is so rich and absorbing it need not be put into additional context. Even for those not familiar with history and the details of Roosevelt's life (and perhaps especially for those who will be introduced to him for the first time), the story is fascinating. Roosevelt has been called one of the most fascinating figures in American history, and Morris's book serves to confirm the reputation. With the exception of a brief prologue which takes us to the White House for one day during T.R.'s presidential years, which gives Morris the opportunity to powerfully describe his subject for the first time, and an interlude toward the middle of the book, where the author, in spell-binding prose, recounts an exceptionally harsh winter that struck the Badlands in 1886-1887, events proceed chronologically, unfolding excitingly before the reader's eyes. We meet the young "Teedie," son of a divided household during the Civil War, his father a prominent New Yorker, and his mother a delicate Southern belle, and follow him on his numerous travels around Europe and the Old World as a boy, where he begins his education. He is a sickly child, almost near death, and must fight to overcome his afflictions and become strong. He develops an unnaturally deep passion for science, and spends a lot of his youth as an amateur zoologists. He enrolls at Harvard, where his strong personality begins to develop. He soon becomes an amateur historian of great success and a fire-branding young New York assemblyman. Some of the most humorous and touching passages come as his courtship and marriage to the beautiful Alice Lee are described. When Alice and his mother both die on the same day, Roosevelt's spirit is shattered, and he heads West to the Dakota badlands, where we witness the growth of Roosevelt the cowboy, rancher and hunter. It is there that the young man develops the love for wild nature that he will carry throughout his life (and plant the seeds for his leadership in the conservation movement at the turn of the century). He marries his childhood sweetheart, Edith Carow, and begins to work his way up in politics once more, first as a Civil Service Commissioner in Washington and then as a New York City Police Commissioner. In both roles he earns a widespread reputation as a reformer, and by the time William McKinley captures the White House in 1896 Roosevelt is promised a post in the new administration. He chooses to be Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and from that position involves himself in the imperialistic push that was then taking over the country, clamoring for a stronger navy and war with Spain. When the war breaks out, he immediately enlists and raises a regiment of cavalry, composed of a motley assortment of Eastern gentlemen and Western cowboys. He leads his celebrated Rough Riders up San Juan Hill and wins a spectacular victory that quickly ends the war. By the time McKinley is up for re-election, Roosevelt is on the ticket, and soon becomes a heartbeat away from office. When, one morning while hiking in the Adirondacks, he learns of tragic news, he realizes his destiny has forever changed.
<br />
<br />	Although thus ends the narrative, Morris's work has a sort of completeness to it. Indeed, the following years would contain many ups and downs for the larger-than-life Roosevelt, yet from his birth to his inauguration in 1901 his life was at its most astonishing. It was both a meteoric rise for the youngest man ever to become President, but also dazzling in its diversity. The multitude of occupations and roles that Roosevelt undertook is unbelievable. He was the prototype of the man of action combined with the prototype of the Renaissance man: a uniquely American type, armed with heavy muscles, grinning teeth, and flashing spectacles. Morris's writing is perfectly adapted to the task. He simply lifts Roosevelt out of the page, and brings him into the reader's mind and heart as a powerful life force. The most common theme by almost everyone who met Roosevelt for the first time is that they were shocked and soon overwhelmed by the strength of the man's personality. The highest credit to Morris is that he has duplicated the effect, through the written word, for readers decades later to experience the same feeling of awe. The Rise Of Theodore Roosevelt is my new favorite book.

                    <span>After reading Theodore Rex, I was sold and I wanted to learn more about the great president.  This book starts off with his birth and works up to Theordore Rex, which highlights Teddy's years in the White House.
<br />
<br />I found this book to be very detailed and interesting.  The only book I can recommend more than this one is Theodore Rex, which is by the same author.  It'd be better to read this one first and then move on.</span>

                    <span>  Mr. Morris is to be honored for such a great job on one of our best and most beloved Presidents. TR, who has been called a steamroller in trousers is an extremely complex and fascinating subject. Many have tried but none has come as close to getting it right on this Renaissance Man.(Who else can say they have been POTUS, holder of the MOH and The Nobel Peace Prize?) The writing is almost Homeric and loaded with fascinating tidbits from the life of this Great Man. What the Author wrote about TR's daughter Alice alone is worth buying it. But I don't want to give it away ! </span>

                    <span>Edmund Morris has created a fantastic array of history coupled with a consideration as to how Roosevelt felt during the events.  The research performed by the author denotes an accute attention to detail and still keeps the reader's attention.  
<br />
<br />The compilation of various photographs and a strategic use of Roosevelt's personal correspondance orient the reader to the great man that  he truly was.  This book, while long is written in such a way that enthusiasts of high school and above should be able to plow through the heaps of material and see the fruit of of their labor by enjoying such a splendid work.   </span>

                    <span>This is one of the best biographies I have ever read.  It is informative, entertaining and inspiring.  There are so many myths and images of T. Roosevelt that many of us neglect to look at the ordinary man who chartered America's path to its status as a superpower in the world today with his convictions and ambitions.  Morris does not intentionally glorify Roosevelt to a larger than life figure; he attempts to present the reader with information about the president's life that influenced his beliefs and actions.  In turn, the reader will view Roosevelt as a larger than life figure because of the extraordinary events in his life and his responses to them.
<br />We see Roosevelt as a paradox that he was: a determined sickly child, lovestruck college student, grieving widower, lover, father, soldier, peacemaker, American, scholar, naturalist and president.  Despite the many facets of his life, Roosevelt comes across as a man of unwavering convictions -- an inspiring read for everyone. 
<br />Morris' clear and simple writing style makes the reading flow beautifully.  It is unbiased as possible, leaving the reader to form his/her own conclusions about this extraordinary president.  Strongly recommended.</span>
