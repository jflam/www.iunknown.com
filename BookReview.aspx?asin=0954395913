                    <span>...would it change the world? This is a compelling collection of stories and thoughts about kindess; what it means and how if people were encouraged to put kindness first it might change the world.  The stories in the book come from people from all walks of life, speaking with empowering and refreshing voices and honestly reflecting on kindness. <p>This is one of those books that with even just a quick dip into it  it can not only make you think about the important questions in life but also inspire you to have hope.</span>

                    <span>This book is an exercise in "redfining kindness", and Roddick goes the distance.  What a beautiful, nuanced, and mindful effort this is.  Anita Roddick revives (and reinscribes) this profoundly simple word "kindness", a word we like to scoff at in our everyday, hard-hitting lives but fail to really take a moment to grasp its dimensions.  In "A Revolution of Kindness", you will find contemplations by people who have taken this moment to pause on kindness.  All I can say is that this is the most eclectic anthology of words I have encountered in recent memory - quotes from CEO's, literary celebrities, activists, scientists, soldiers, journalists, singers, feminists, philosophers, religious leaders, vagabonds - a smorgasboard of inspiration, wisdom from all directions, even the most unexpected ones.  Buy this book, read this book, SHARE this book!  It is very accessible and simply a darn good read - a collection of short expositions, excerpts, aphorisms, candid quotes, and tiny manifestos that are enhanced by terribly intelligent, edgy graphics (lots of pulp-y pastiche and pop references.. Roddick has all angles covered!).  It's about time that we reintroduce kindness into our lives, and give it the care that it deserves.  This book is consumer-cute and sort of has that on-the-go punchy feel, but it manages to be so substantial at the same time.  It will fill up your heart.</span>
