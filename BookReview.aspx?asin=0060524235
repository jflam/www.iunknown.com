                    <span>Elijah Wald has put together not only a wonderful testimony to Robert Johnson but has created an excellent introduction to the birth of the blues. After having enjoyed the read, I now have an excellent reference book to all the blues artists (and their songs) that I've known and many he introduced to me for the first time. Elijah's passion for the blues is very apparent and he has enhanced my blues passion all that much more. "Satisfied and tickled too"  </span>

                    <span>Another book about blues musician Robert Johnson? Yes, and it's worth reading because Escaping The Delta: Robert Johnson And The Invention Of The Blues goes beyond just another biographical sketch of Johnson to probe how blues moved beyond its delta roots. There have been other histories of the blues, but this is the first to link Johnson's legacy to the evolution of the genre as a whole, showing how the music was transformed not just by Johnson but by his white listeners, who changed him from an obscure Mississippi guitarist to a legend. If the title sounds familiar, it's because this is a new paperback edition - but wait, there's more: a bonus cd which includes a rare first take of Johnson's 'Traveling Riverside Blues' - the only sing missing from the famous Sony 'complete recordings' set.

                    <span>This is, by far, the best book of its Genre. 
<br />
<br />Robert Johnson's legend has grown over the past 60 years to that of some sort of blues messiah. Wald's very complete, extraordinarily well researched, and very well written discussion cuts through much of the legend and reminds us that Johnson was "just" a man. He did not spring from some cotton field and invent the blues. He did not singlehandedly lay the foundation for Rock and Roll. In his day, he was a rather obscure performer who had an uncanny knack to play any kind of blues style.
<br />
<br />HOW he came to be considered the King of the Delta Blues is just as informative, to me at least, as his biography itself. It is a facinating look at American culture and mores.
<br />
<br />My favorite part of the book is the song-by-song discussion Wald goes into. His insights are fascinating. It's worth the price of the book to read along as the music is being played in the background. 
<br />
<br />Even with the legend stripped away, the strength of Johnson's body of work still earns him a spot with the greats of music history.</span>

                    <span>Previous reviewers have accurately captured the insightful treatment Elijah Wald gives this discussion of Robert Johnson and the Delta Blues.
<br />
<br />I want to be sure everyone is aware of the full length companion CD that can be purchased "Back to the CrossRoads:  The Roots of Robert Johnson".  This CD is meant as a companion piece to the book.
<br />
<br />The book is a scholarly investigation into the various musical, cultural, and business/economic influences that comprised the world in which Robert Johnson (RJ) created his music and his landmark recordings.
<br />
<br />Elijah Wald's research suggests RJ was not the tortured artist recluse who single-handedly invented the Delta Blues. Rather, Wald suggests - with full respect for the talent and genious of the man - Robert Johnson was a talented and skilled entertainer of the time who listened to and mastered many of the diverse contemporary music styles of his time - and then he created his own songs echoing these popular styles. The legacy this single artist provided in a very short number of years is truly amazing. 
<br />
<br />One listen to the CD and Elijah's Wald premise is clarified. The similarities of music (and occasional sharing of lyrics - not uncommon for the time or genre) is obvious, and each song on this CD can easily be related to one of Robert Johnson's masterworks created several years later. This truly is a fabulous collection of Robert Johnson influences and by itself is a very listenable compilation of popular music contemporary to Robert Johnson.
<br />
<br />To the casual fan of Robert Johnson's music, the CD is a great addition to your collection, as it provides additional tracks of music quite similar to the beloved Johnson songs. To the true acoustic Blues enthusiast, the CD coupled with the book provides a wonderful combination of insite to the music of the time.

                    <span>This edition contains a two-song CD, but no information about what songs are on it. The songs are Robert Johnson's "Traveling Riverside Blues," take one (the only Johnson cut that was missing from the Sony "Complete Recordings" box), and Leroy Carr's "Mean Mistreater Mama," which was the model for Johnson's "Kindhearted Woman Blues."
