                    <span>I dig Elliott Kalb's Books big time. His Basketball Book was on point&This Baseball Book is another Winner. Barry Bonds is the Greatest Ever to me as well.Josh Gibson was so ahead of his time it ain't even funny. I enjoy how Elliott Kalb breaks things down&he makes you look at all the possiblitys.He is a very gifted writer&I dig how He challenges you on players.</span>

                    <span>A pastoral game scribed to urban contexts while having fair ter-
<br />ritory as expansive as the universe, baseball is to America what
<br />Lewis&Clark was to the Jefferson administration.  Its goal to
<br />reach a "clearing in the distance" only matters if you can come
<br />home.  And with no two playing fields the same, it's what dreams
<br />are made of: induced by memory and reinforced by endless argu-
<br />ments, but with every day a whole new ballgame.  With Kalb,
<br />either I'm finally home (a steal for $15!), or I've died and
<br />gone to heaven.

                    <span>As with Mr. Kalb's basketball book, I find it super hard to agree with his picks. Barry Bonds as the best player ever in baseball is too much for me to swallow. But as with his basketball book, it's the DETAILS of his arguments which I find so interesting. I don't have to agree with Elliott in order to find his arguments interesting. He sold me that Josh Gibson was the best catcher ever. I hadn't thought about it, but I now agree Roger Clemens is the best active pitcher today. And I'll never forget his "Better Analogy" for Sandy Koufax to Elliott's own wife Amy ("both born on Dec. 30th and wild in their 20's"). Buy this book if you want to sound intelligent in arguing who the best players of all time are.</span>

                    <span>I just got this book in time for the baseball season, and it is the best book I've ever read.  Kalb makes great points about Bonds being better than everyone else, but I loved some of the other chapters even more.  Josh Gibson the greatest catcher of all time?  Pedro Martinez ahead of Randy Johnson?  This is a great book for people who want to get to know about the top players of all time.</span>
