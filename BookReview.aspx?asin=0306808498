                    <span>A fine book.<br>But Chambers is also slightly upset, I think, that Quincy Troupe got to work with Miles on his autobiogrpahy and not he -- and what Chambers' book is missing is exactly the kind of personal material (and voice) you find in Miles' autiobiograpy ("Miles").<br>The best thing about this book is the discussion of the wider context of Miles' music and performance ("the times"), but without Miles own voice it degenerates through the end of Part Two into a kind of annotated discography (mind you -- that's not all bad -- it is accurate and gave me a few ideas for out of the way purchases).<br>So, I recommend reading both this book and "Miles", for a complete picture.</span>

                    <span>This is probably the best book about the life of Miles Davis I have found.  I have read his autobiography, the biography by Carr, and So What along with a couple of other Miles books.  This one simply gives the best detail and most interesting about the artists life.  If you want to read a book about Miles Davis start with this one.  It is quite lenghty but there weren't many dull moments in Davis's life.</span>

                    <span>Jack Chambers has done a very hard task and that is to present the life of the legendary Miles Davis to readers in a very interesting, yet complex style which was reflective of the way Miles Davis led his life and music.  <p>Miles Davis was the premiere jazz musician of his time along with John Coltrane, Charlie "Bird" Parker, Herbie Hancock, etc, yet while you can love Davis's music, to know the man was very hard to do, since Miles Davis was a standoffish and sullen individual.  Chambers describes Davis's behavior as being sullen and hard to know because Davis's was a very shy man.  I am sure that Davis lived a tough life because of injustice, yet it is sad that he didn't trust his fans and those who cared for him.   Davis certainly lived the life of a "star", he over-indulged in sex, was an abuser of drugs, and had split personalities later on in life, yet his musical vision was almost always focused and clear, whether it be in the pinnacle of his talent (1950-1962), or his creating fusion (1967-1973), or the later part of his life.<p>Chambers does an excellent job of detailing the relationship Miles had with his fellow musicians such as the love-hate relationship with Theolonius Monk, the admiration and jealousy between Coltrane and Miles, as well as Miles being a mentor to such jazz greats as Herbie Hancock, John McGlaughlin, Chick Corea, etc.<p>I am a tremendous fan of Miles Davis jazz visions, I love his music and his musical style, yet after reading this book I feel sadness because I don't know if I pity Davis or just not liking him altogether, or admiring him no matter what, his final years were spent in paranoia, suspicion and feeding his ego, that is sad because if he would of just relaxed and enjoy his fans admiration I believe he might have lived longer.  Anyways, this is an outstanding book and is highly recommended to all jazz lovers and fans of the immortal Miles Davis.</span>

                    <span>By the time I found out about Jack Chambers' Miles biographies (two volumes, originally) they had been combined into this single book with some new material that brings the original manuscripts from the 1980's up to  date. Despite the heading on this site, this is the complete 800-odd page  monster bio, not an "introduction"!<p>This is a fantastic bio.  Like many other critics and older fans who were raised on jazz, Chambers  can't really relate to Miles' work from the late 1960's onwards, but he  does give it comprehensive coverage, rather than pretend that it all ended  with "The Quintet". I'm not sure that criticisms about his  quoting reviews are justified. I saw it as just being thorough - giving  details of the critics' reactions to recordings rather than just his own. I  learned much from his chronicling of events, right through to the  seventies, that I did not know. <p>If you are a fan of Miles' final period  (1981 comeback to his death in 1991), then you're probably the only one who  will feel short-changed. As this was not a period that interested me  greatly, I was not particularly bothered (probably exhausted by then!).<p>A  really professional effort.</span>

                    <span>Milestones is a great, indepth biography on possibly the most important and influential Jazzman of all time.  This book not only showcases Miles life as a musician, but also gives a histroy lesson as to what was  happening to the Jazz world.  For any Jazz lover...this book is a must!</span>
