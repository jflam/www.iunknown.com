                    <span>Major playwrite, Norwegian Henrik Ibsen, was born in 1828 and wrote Doll House in 1879.   It was performed in London 1889 and Paris 1894,  Ibsen died in 1906.  
<br />
<br />The twisting and advancing plot revolves around several themes, illusion in marriage, conflict with society, feminism, wealth, betrayal, family, and intrigue.  
<br />
<br />The dramatic play is rich in symbolism, but the most profound is the title, A Doll House, which exemplifies the nature of the relationship that Nora and her husband Torvald have long since demonstrated; she is his little doll.     
<br />
<br />Torvald portrays the "man" in control of finances and the home; he conducts his life the way society dictates.  Nora is the sweet submissive wife who plays along with her husband dominant role, just as was the relationship with her father.  Torvald 's endearments of Nora are belittling, "little squirrel", little spendthrift, little lark."   
<br />
<br />But their illusional  marriage takes a turn,  Through a past incident for the love of her husband, Nora's secret is about to be divulged.  Through that experience she no longer functions in submissive role and makes a grand stand.  During this, Torvald  is driven to a wimpering soul. 
<br />
<br />The story is in three acts and each act reveals different character attitudes and Nora's fight and progression.  The interesting story culminates with a dramatic twist.....MzRizz

                    <span>I finished Ibsen's "A Doll's House" a few days ago, and it's still haunting me.  Well-crafted with interesting (albeit, at times, superficial) characters, it raises questions that still matter today.  Nora craves a chance to find herself, yet at the same time, has enjoyed her sheltered life.  This contradiction is still central to modern women - how much freedom do we really want?  Nora demonstrates this clearly by craving freedom her own life, while also being surprised that her husband didn't stand up for her and defend her honor by tarnishing his own.  
<br />
<br />Ibsen was one of the first to ask these questions so blatantly and in the theater, but they continue to resonate today.  Overall, a great, thought-provoking, quick read that will stick with you.</span>

                    <span>This book is hailed for giving females a voice. Although it does speak for women, it really speaks for society as a whole. Just what is happiness? Living in a comfortable house with not a care in the world? Or, defining who you truly are by working hard at whatever you're good at? The story will seem slow at first. There's just character development/background and an introduction to the "troubling" dilemna of Nora in the early parts of the story. The perfect pacing builds up so much until the big devastating end, where the characters make huge life changing revelations. I started questioning what happiness was after reading what the characters went through. Are people so caught up at trying to maintain the ideal image of the "good" life that they forget to find out what they truly want? Real good book, I read the whole thing in one sitting.</span>

                    <span>"Spark Notes A Doll's House" was helpful in clearing up small, subtly plot facts, but the play is so straightforward, that "Spark Notes" is essentially unnecessary.  I "sorta" recommend.</span>

                    <span>"A Doll's House" is a book that should be read by all women, but should also be read by men.  The story is so powerful, intriguing, heart wrenching, nail biting, ulcer giving, and just fantastic!  For Henrik Ibsen to write this during his time must have sent wives into fantasies and men into worries.  While I'm unsure about Nora's final decision, I was positively sure that Torvald was a pathetic husband and didn't deserve a wife.  I recommend!</span>
