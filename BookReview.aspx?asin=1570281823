                <span id="Label1">Athlete. Runner. Marathoner.  Are these words you wouldn't exactly use to describe yourself? Do you consider yourself too old or too out of shape to run a marathon? But somewhere deep inside have you always admired the people who could reach down and come up with the mental and physical strength to complete such a daunting and rewarding accomplishment?  It doesn't have to be somebody else crossing the finish line. You can be a marathoner.   <I>The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer</I> is based on the highly successful marathon class offered by the University of Northern Iowa, which was featured in a <I>Runner's World</I> article titled "Marathoning 101." The class has been offered five times over 10 years, and all but one student finished the marathon. That is approximately 200 students -- all first time marathoners and many with absolutely no running background.   This book follows the same 16-week, four-day-a-week workout plan. What makes the success rate of this program so much higher than any other? The special emphasis on the psychological aspects of endurance activities. You don't have to love to run -- you don't even have to like it -- but you have to realize that you are capable of more than you have ever thought possible. One participant in the program explained it like this:  "I'm doing this for me -- not for others or the time clock. I just feel better when I run, plus it helps me to cope with things in general. The skills we've learned in this class don't apply just to marathoning -- they apply to life! Just like you never know what the next step in a marathon will bring, so too, you never know what will happen next in life. But if you don't keep going, you're never going to find out. By staying relaxed, centered, and positive you handle just about anything that comes your way."  This is marathon running for real people, people with jobs and families and obligations outside of running. <I>The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer</I> has proven successful for men and women of all ages. Now let it work for you.</span>

                    <span>This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon. This book made such a difference in my life, I had to comment on it. Six months ago I decided I needed to do something to get in better shape. I was in decent shape, I played raquet ball a few times a week, but I couldn't run more than a mile and really didn't have any interest in doing so. I came across the book title on Amazon and decided to check it out. I read the book while on vacation and decided I was going to run a marathon. I did the pre-training for a week and then began the program. Then the most important part, I started telling friends and family I was going to run a marathon. <P>I finished my first marathon yesterday( 10/28/01) in Mystic, Connecticut, in four hours and 51 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I learned that the marathon was the reward and the training was the goal. During my training I read a number of marathon books, they all had helpful advice, but none were as important as this book. It was a guide, a reference and logbook. Its no longer just a book, its a memoir of the journey to my first marathon!</span>

                    <span>This is my first book review ever. I found this book while browsing for a book about hockey. I always had in the back of my mind that someday, someday I'll run a marathon. I've run fairly regularly the past few years, but never more that 2-3 miles. This book does exactly what it says - prepares you to finish the race, nothing more. Once you realize a marathon is 85% mental training, then the training runs just become reinforcement for your motivation. In September 2002 I ran my first marathon, the Air Force Marathon in Dayton, OH, and I finished in five hours flat. <P>There is little in life that can compare with crossing the finish line of your first marathon. I had been told that before the run, but had to learn for myself that it is very true. If you apply the techniques in this book, and stay focused on your goal, you WILL complete the run. <P>This book was exactly the right kind of help at the right time. I recommend it to anyone starting their own personal quest for the 26.2!</span>

                    <span>For years I had watched people run marathons, and was filled with a mixture of awe and the feeling that "they are nuts!" Deep down I knew that I wanted to tackle a marathon someday, but I was scared that I didn't have it in me. This book changed that perception.<P>In the spring of 1999 I suddenly decided to sign up for the Twin Cities Marathon. In searching for advice on how to prepare, I checked out every book I could find at our local library. Most of them were just not for me. They assumed that I had been running for years (in truth, I hadn't laced up my shoes in almost 10 years). The minute I picked up this book, that all changed. It might as well have been titled "Ben's Marathon Trainer."<P>The tone/mantra of this book is simple and consistent -- "If you WANT to run a marathon you CAN run a marathon." You set your goal (to finish the race regardless of time) and visualize that goal early and consistently. <P>Each chapter focuses on one week in a 16 week training schedule. They provide a well paced physical schedule like all the other books. However, what this book provides that the others are lacking is a week by week EMOTIONAL training schedule. I don't know how many times I would come back from a training run feeling a little down, pick up the the book, and find that the next section talked SPECIFICALLY about the emotions I had felt on the run.<P>Count me as one of this book's success statistics! Just as I visualized, I finished the TC Marathon with flying colors (if not a flying time ;) ). Better yet, I loved every minute of it.</span>

                    <span>Four friends and I all used this book to train for our first marathon. When I first bought the book, I hadn't run a step in more than 5 years. Some of the other women had never been runners. The training plan is sound and easy to follow. The psychological impact of this book is incredible. It absolutely makes you believe in yourself. We all successfully completed the marathon and felt great about the whole process. This isn't the book for you if you have speed goals in mind, but for anyone whose goal is to simply finish a marathon, this book is the best!</span>
