                <span id="Label1">Microsoft .NET is an innovative software framework that promises to change software development as we know it. This book answers the questions "What is Microsoft .NET and how do I profit from it?" The author breaks these questions down into "What problems does Microsoft .NET solve?"; "What architectural approaches does it take to solve them?"; and "How do I get started using it?" Each chapter is written in a logical, pyramidal format, with simpler, high-level concepts introduced first, followed by a more detailed technical discussion, so readers can easily choose how deep they wish to go into each chapter. The author progressively adds to the depth of Microsoft .NET information in each chapter, diagrams and simple code samples in the Microsoft Visual Basic.NET to make his points.</span>

                    <span>From the foreword: "a high level and easy to understand overview of a subject with some code...funny to read and very informative, with lots of interesting code...about teaching you the mindset of .NET."<br>As a hobbyist/beginner programmer I found Platt's book very interesting and very easy to read. <br>One question I've had is just what is this '.NET thing' and what does it hold for the future of computer usage/programming?<br>.NET has been for me an elusive something that even Microsoft seems to have difficulty defining in an easy and succinct way.<br>Platt has provided just that, an entertaining and informative overview of the .NET mindset. He provides an introduction to .NET objects and the good code needed to run on various platforms and solution architecture, IL and JIT and .NET Namespaces, OOP features and memory management.<br>ASP.NET pages, web controls, and secuirty. .NET Web services--writing web service clients and the WSDL file. Windows forms--controls and events, hosting ActiveX controls are all looked at in easy to understand--hey that makes sense to me!-- language.<br>Platt uses a problem background--what problems does MS.NET solve? and solution architecture with simplest example method of exploring the 5 topics covered. He covers a single topic from the top down in each chapter, starting simpler and then progressing into greater technical detail with a minimum of jargon and a maximum of wit. Platt uses many detailed diagrams and analogies and clear explanations along with code samples--written in VB.NET--more samples are provided on the book's web site. <br>When I finished this 200 page easy to read book I learned enough about this development platform to understand a little better the future of software as a service and what this '.NET thing' is.<br>Let me recommend this book as an excellent introduction to the 'mystery' of what .Net is all about.</span>

                    <span>This book is a very good BRIEF and HIGH LEVEL overview of .Net. And a pleasure to read. <br>It is mostly tailored to pre-.Net VB programmers, but may also be useful for Java programmers interested in this technology.<br>The author assumes that his readers do have some experience, primarily with VB. <br>It is not a tutorial, neither a how-to book, so people with little or no prior experience with programming will not benefit from it. <br>I particularly liked authors approach to start every chapter with describing a problem that programmers faced in pre-.Net world, and then explain how .Net attempts to solve this problem. This really puts all featurs covered by the book into right context and helps understand .Net as a solution architecture built on top of prior technologies, and not as a stand-alone piece of software wizardry.<br>Highly recommend this book to managers that have previous coding experience.<br>Do NOT recommend it for managers without it, as the book heavinly relies on code examples.</span>

                    <span>I hate reading 'dry' books, and I can assure you, this book is not at all a dry one.  It gives you the bigger picture of .NET, and the philosophy and concepts behind it. It will not give you details about how to implement something, for that you will need to refer to Programming .NET components, which I have also strongly recommended.<br>Mr. Platt is humourous, keeping you stuck to the book. I respect his ability to abstract out the concepts from intricacies.<p>Again, a very good read, for the bigger picture</span>

                    <span>It seems that the author has a fear of not being able to deliver a satisfying content. Thus he comes arond many issues by writing to meny humorous bits that (in the long run) tends to get in the way of the actual information. -I prefer a natural mixture of both information and humour.<br>-But, if the reader is able to look through (or like) the author's personal jitter, it can be a quite an informative book.</span>

                    <span>This review is based on the first edition.  Good intro to .NET.  I read through the last sentence but did skip some unfamiliar explanations on COM and previous programming methodologies.  Great explanation of Web Service, which another book on C# totally failed to.  The humor gets wordy a lot, so beware - however, some analogies are excellent.</span>
