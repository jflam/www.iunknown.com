                    <span>Ambrose has created a new genre of historical writing; instead of simply retelling the events, he gets down deep into the heart of the matter for a complete understanding. In this book, he compares the original journey of Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery to his own vacations with his family along the Lewis and Clark Trail that offer an interesting modern perspective on one of the most important events in American history. The story is full of amazing facts regarding the surrounding land, weather conditions, wildlife, the people on the expedition, and the people encountered along the way; all intersting details that are never mentioned in any history class. <p>The voyage is not merely told from an historical standpoint of a chain of events, for it also describes the trip from a human perspective, allowing any reader to feel as though they have become a part of the excusion themselves. Even the most minor players are described at some point or another, and Ambrose provides many details about the every day trials of such a trip, especially through the frequent inclusion of the valuable journal entries from the trip's two commanders, Lewis and Clark themselves. Ambrose goes so far as to proclaims their journals as "America's epic poem."<p>This story is truly a testament to the unshakable American character, and Ambrose has done much to encourage its revival. I would recommend it to any history buff or any patriotic American. Combined with stunning photographs from National Geographic photographer Sam Abell, this book teaches a history lesson that cannot be beaten.</span>

                    <span>This book is about the author Stephen Ambrose retracing the Lewis and Clark expidition with his family. The author goes from the present to the past at each point of the journey. He tells of his experiences at that location then he describes the events of Lewis and Clark at that time.<p>I was impressed by the details that Lewis and Clark made in their journal. The book contains excerps from their journal. Each animal they encounter was drawn and described in accurate details. Many of these animals, such as the bison and the prairie dog, were seen for the first time by white men. <p>I purchased the delux leather bound edition through National Geographic. The photographs were of typical National Geographic high quality.</span>

                    <span>Wow!  I love this book. I also love Ambrose's writing. He instills so much  energy into this tale. Anyone who has seen Ken Burns' Lewis and Clark-The  Journey of the Corps of Discovery,  will remember how strong a presence he  had in that film. He is truly dynamic. The history teacher I never had.     I've been reading this book in conjunction with the journals and it really  makes a great combo. When I'm a little confused as to what's happening in  the journals, this book helps fill in the blanks. Maps and archival photos  are also a real nice touch.  Oh, and the landscape photos are beautiful  too.    I also have to disagree with a previous reviewer who mentioned that  the addition of Ambrose's family experiences were annoying. I find them  enjoyable and they really help give me a sense of what many of the L &  C places are like in the present. I've always wondered about that.    This  book is A MUST for L & C admirers.</span>
