                    <span>Before you read my comment, please be aware that I am a college student with experiences in programming languages such as java and C++, PHP, etc. However, I do not know anything about ASP.NET.
<br />
<br />This book is really well written. It is easy to follow. It is true that this book doesn't cover the coding in details, but again if you have been exposed to programming, you'll be able to make sense of the code and in no time, will be able to modify it. 
<br />
<br />This book is great to be used as an INITIAL transition to ASP.NET. Bravo Scott Mitchell

                    <span>I got this book becuase I just want to know how to simply connect to a database in ASP.NET.  This book failed for that purpose.  Rather than explaining things step by step, this book does a "quickie" job trying to explain complicated procedures in a few short paragraphs.  The topics are so condensed, it is almost like reading a college student's notes for class.  It does not give enough detail or examples to get you started writing high powered applications in ASP.NET.</span>

                    <span>My background is Classic ASP.  I know it extremely well, having learned much in the early days from the author's website and his ASP Book: ASP in 24 Hours.  I consider that book to be a 5+ star book.  
<br />
<br />I am new to ASP.NET.  Unfortunately, ASP and ASP.NET have very little in common besides using VB as a base language.  In this book Scott describes the basics of ASP.NET quite well.
<br />
<br />The big problem I have with this book is that it should be renamed to: ASP.NET using Web Matrix in 24 hours.  The Web Matrix project has been abandoned by Microsoft.  Not only that, but the current release of Web Matrix is different than the version Scott uses in his book.  This causes some confusion and requires some searching for toolbars and functions.  The most current version of Web Matrix is beta at best, and it contains significant bugs.
<br />
<br />After reading the book you will know how to drag and drop ASP.NET components.  You will not know how to code ASP.NET.  
<br />
<br />Like another reviewer said, the "that topic is beyond the scope of this book" statement was used far too often.
<br />
<br />In closing, I believe Scott Mitchell is a talented author.  However, this book is disappointing because it teaches you how to drag and drop using an outdated development tool.</span>

                    <span>I am an experienced programmer with 10 experience.  However my knowledge was mainly desktop development (statistical application).  This book was an excellent introduction for me.  The examples are basic but clear.  I would happily buy another book by Scott Mitchell.  I now feel that I undertand all of the basic and I'm ready for something more advanced.  Reading the other reviews I cannot see how anyone can give this book only one star - it's positioned as an introductory book and it does this job well.</span>

                    <span>I recently purchased this book for my job.  I have learned a lot from this book so far, but ran into a problem that I could not figure out.  I asked around my job space, but no one knew the answer.  So, I emailed the person who wrote this book on Friday, and I had a response that Monday when I got in.  Scott helped me out with my problem, and now my application is up and running beautifully.  Thanks again Scott!!  I recommend this book for all!!</span>
