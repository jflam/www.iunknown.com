                    <span>This book got me so hooked in reading that I didn't even want to go to bed last night. I like how this book is formatted. It tells you straight to the point on what to do. Then, she illustrates why it's beneficial to do that with real life experiences. Every sentence in this book has so much value. I kept typing up notes that ended up six pages long and possibly even more once I finished reading it today! This book is a keeper!</span>

                    <span>Took notes throughout the book!  Even though I've owned the business for three years I gleaned lots of invaluable information from the experience of Orange and her husband.  Would recommend to anyone in retail--new to it or an "old hat."</span>

                    <span>Let me start by introducing myself and explaining an apparent potential conflict of interest...<p>I'm a CPA in Redmond, WA and am always on the lookup for resources that I can suggest to clients. I have quite a few independent retail clients and so was interested in this book.<p>I also happen to be the author of QuickBooks for Dummies and Quicken for Dummies.<p>Okay, all that said, I think Carol Schroeder's book is a pretty good one. The book has lots of good information for the independent retailer or the prospective independent retailer. (As you can see, I gave it four stars!) But I really think that the Retail Business Kit for Dummies is a better book. There's more information in the Dummies book and it's an easier read.<p>One final comment: Before you say to yourself, "Hey, he's just recommending another Dummies book, that's bogus!" let me point out that both the Dummies series of books and "Specialty Shop Retailing" are published by the same company, John Wiley & Sons.<p>Maybe the thought I'll leave you with is this: If you're interested in learning more about starting and running a successful retail store, read Retail Business Kit for Dummies first... then, if you want more information and have time for another book, read Specialty Shop Retailing. You will get good information in the Shroeder book that isn't in the Dummies book.<p>Steve</span>

                    <span>A detailed well written text that guides the prospective or seasoned shop owner through the business of owning and operating a business.  Industry terms are thoroughly explained, other resources given and numerous examples of effective business forms are provided.  Ms. Schoeder guides the reader through the book using humor and anecdotes making it hard to put down.  This is a must reference for anyone contemplating starting a business.</span>
