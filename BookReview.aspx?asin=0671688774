                <span id="Label1">Why is <i>A Season on the Brink</i> the bestselling sports book of all time? The answer is easy: Bobby Knight. Audaciously brilliant, exasperatingly volatile, and <i>never</i> boring, the Indiana University basketball coach is Greek drama and comedy neatly wrapped in a red sweater. Like all high-strung people, Knight is particularly interesting when things don't go according to his playbook. John Feinstein had the good fortune to follow Knight and his Hoosiers through a difficult 1985-86 campaign; that Feinstein could watch that season attached to Knight's hip gives <i>A Season on the Brink</i> its sights and its sounds. That such closeness allowed entry into Knight's heart gives the book its fury. The  combination is irresistible.</span>

                    <span>As a huge sports fan, I couldn't wait to read this book and get an inside look into a college basketball season with Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. John Feinstein pulled off a minor miracle by convincing Knight to allow him to follow the whole team, players and coaches alike with his notepad and tape recorder throughout the 1985-86 season.<P>What you'll see is an inside look at the trials and tribulations of a big-time college basketball team and the sometime circus atmosphere created by their tempermental coach. The book starts off with a quick recap of the 1984-85 season which included the now famous chair throwing incident. Then you are lead through the offseason, training camp and regular season of 1985-86. Feinstein does a good job of keeping up the pace despite giving detailed recaps of every season's game. He ends the book with a brief summary of the national championship season of 1986-87.<P>There's no doubt who the center point of the whole book is: That of course is Bob Knight. I'm not an Indiana hoosier fan but I certainly was well aware of all the incidents Knight's been involved in over the years including the chair throwing, head butting, and choking. I can't say that my opinion of him changed at all after reading this book. The best word I can use to describe him is: complex. <P>In this book, you'll read how he verbally abuses players, especially Daryl Thomas. He'll play mind games like he did with Steve Alford, the team captain and best player. He'll be upbeat about the performance of the team one minute, and then the next he'll say how the team is horrible and will never win with these players. Warning: there is some profanity, but the f-words are "blanked" out.<P>But at the same time, this coach is extremely loyal to his players after they graduate. He'll do favors such as help get them jobs, etc. One of the most touching moments in the book is when he meets a family where the father and son are deaf-mute. Is his good side good enough to put up with his other nonsense? You be the judge!<P>Supposedly, BK was NOT very happy with the book. I don't know what he expected, but Feinstein clearly didn't take sides or had some kind of adgenda to [thrash] Knight. This is must read for all sports fans, Indiana Hoosiers or not.</span>

                    <span>"A Season on the Brink" <P> A Season on the Brink, was a great book. This book was about a coaching legend. Bob Knight, is described by many sport fans as one of the best coaches of all time. This is not just a plain old book. This book is about a coach walking between extreme madness and a complete genius. <BR>In August of 1984, Bob Knight of Indiana University, lead the U.S Olympic basketball team to the gold medal. At that time, this was a master achievement to add to his two NCAA tournament championships. Many coaches to this day have not accomplished anything like this. <BR>In February of 1985, Bob Knight's sees glimpses of his career coming to an end. His team is struggling dramatically. The Hoosier supporters are curious to what is happening to their Indiana program. Now Knight is known to go a little haywire, so anything is possible. In February of 1985, Bobby Knight throws a chair across the floor as a Purdue player is preparing to take foul shots. A little haywire is absurd! This is something that one would watch in a hockey game, not a NCAA Basketball game. Knight was suspended for only one game after reacting like he did. After ending that season, Knight was to where sky was the limit, to rock bottom! Knight also knew if another season like this was to occur, that his career was on the edge. Entering the 1985-86 season, would be a season on the brink. <BR>Bobby Knight had been preaching his team that they needed to get into position to be in position. The Hoosiers were 2-2 in the Big Ten. Their next game was at home, against the Ohio State Buckeyes. This was a deciding game for the Indiana Hoosiers. This would give them a chance to be in the run for the Big Ten race. Daryl Thomas had a severe sprained ankle, while Ohio State had a seven-foot center to guard. Amongst all of this, Bobby Knight ended up getting a technical foul. In the end, the Hoosiers somehow pulled the victory off. From there on out the tide had changed. I chose to write about this game, because Knight had told his team what needed to be done, and they conquered it with all the given obstacles. <BR>The Indiana Hoosiers were back to being Hoosiers again!</span>

                    <span>A Season on the Brink is a very outspoken and true story of the infamous coach and his legendary Hoosiers during the 1985-86 seasons. After a very disappointing season the year before Knight and his Hoosiers prepare for the season ahead. Season, is an invigorating story of Knights personality and his explosive demeanor. John Feinstein was granted the entire year by Bobby Knight to follow the team on every game, practice, and meeting the team had that year. A Season on the Brink goes in the world that Knight has with his players and his way of motivating his team to reach his goals. Feinstein doesn't pull any punches but he is very unbiased also letting the reader see Knights softer side. Season details player opinions and the opinions of others associated with Indiana basketball. This is a very explosive and fun book that delves deep into the psyche of Knight and his own weird way of doing things. An exciting adventure for any Hoosier or college basketball fan that loves the drama of the game and the fire that Bob Knight brings to the table.</span>

                    <span>As a basketball fan, I was very excited to have read the book. I give the book, A Season on the Brink a five star. The book surpasses my expectation. As a former athlete and a basketball player, I can honestly say that I can relate to some of the players. The hardships that the players had to go through and the torments of yelling were just two of the things I can really relate to. The book helped me realize how basketball was played in Indiana under Bobby Knight. The two practices or what we would call "two a days" were always a big let down. <BR>All the running and drills the players had to go through seemed never ending. <BR>I can also relate to the player when yelling is involved. In the book, all Bobby Knight seemed to do was yell at his players. I can relate to that because my high school coach was the same. To the players, their work seemed pointless because Bobby Knight would always yell at them. I think some players can work under such circumstances, but others can't. We clearly see that in the book. Some players can stand Knight's yelling and let it go while others take the yelling and criticism to the heart. Those players that do let all of Knight's yelling get to them, start to lose their confidence and focus. In the book, a coach informed Daryl Thomas, that if Knight is yelling at him, he wants him to get better, but if he quits yelling at him, then Knight's no longer interested in him. After reading that part, I was shocked because my high school coach informed me of the same concept. <BR>While reading the book, I felt that Knight was really hard on the players, but I came to the conclusion that he was a good coach. I don't like his temper, but this book helped me realize how good a coach and person he was. The book also helped me relate to the players and all the hardships, suffering and yelling they had to go through. I think people should read this book especially if they are hard core basketball fans because they would more than likely relate to some parts of the book.</span>
