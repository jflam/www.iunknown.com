                    <span>John Gardner has rightfully been called the "Father of Small Craft" in The U.S.. The fellow knew more about small boats - how to design them, build them and enjoy them - than just about anybody in the late 20th Century. This book combines two of his classic works into one. Now don't expect to start building your first boat a day after this book comes in the mail. Although the plans and construction notes are very good, John assumed that you knew how to carve a rabbet and lay a plank. I don't. And yet this book lives in my bathroom where I can open it to just about any page and be inspired in a minute or less. His description of what makes the right kind of rowboat got me to build my first row boat. I've been hooked on rowing and building since. Thank You Mr. Gardner!</span>

                    <span>If you're interested in learning how to build wooden boats but have NO wooden boat building experience whatsoever this book is NOT the book for you. The Duck Trap Press how-to books might be a better place to start. This book appears to contain a wealth of information from a very experienced author. There's a ton of good historical information contained within. Unfortunately without knowing how to 'read' wooden boat plans and drawings and understand the terminology that the author uses this book did not meet my expecations at all.</span>

                    <span>This collection of complete boat plans, instructions, and boat-building tips is simply wonderful. Mr. Gardner was a man with the common touch and the ability to communicate clearly--all of these boats are aimed at the "amateur" builder. He has no axes to grind; his designs include all of the traditional construction techniques plus glued plywood and taped seam plywood; there are rowboats, sailboats, and powerboats. The articles are also sprinkled with historical and editorial commentary. I'm reading it for the fourth (or is it fifth?) time. When I finish my canoe...</span>

                    <span>This book (actually a collection of two earlier books) is full of great boats with their histories and the plans and instructions to build them. It covers a range of tradional small craft with and emphasis on New England work boats. A variety of construction techniques are discussed. It's a compelling read whether you're looking for a boat to build or just love boats. I couldn't put it down.</span>
