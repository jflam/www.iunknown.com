                    <span>To my surprise Bob Woodward has brought a fresh angle to perhaps the most reported event of our times. The angle is the variety of viewpoints, personalities and management styles among the President's senior advisory group. If you think Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney were calling the shots on US retaliatory policy, I suspect Woodward's work will change your mind. CIA chief George Tennent brought Bush what he wanted--a plan that could be implemented quickly and forcefully. Rumsfeld and the DOD were talking in terms of months while Bush was thinking in terms of days. Condoleeza Rice's role (and influence with the boss) was greater than I had thought. Bob Woodward seems to have sources that no one else has, plus an ability to intersperse historical perspective on the players in question. The George Bush in "Bush At War" bears no resemblence to the GWB of Saturday Night Live. The real Bush took charge, knew what he wanted to do and did it. Somewhat to my surprise I might add. This book is not a rehash; it provides a view into the White House inner circle that you won't get on the evening news or CNN.</span>

                    <span>Just as he has never revealed the identity of the infamous Deep Throat, so to has Bob Woodward secured the wherewithal as to how he procured the classified dialogue of National Security Council meetings which he so prominently displays throughout Bush at War. A juicy example - Deputy Secretary of State conveying to Colin Powell, "They're eating cheese on you"(military for you're getting used) when Rumsfeld and Cheney contradict Powell's earlier statements necessitating the U.N. Inspectors in Iraq. <P>Having read Fighting Back by Bill Sammon and enjoying it thoroughly, I likewise found Bush at War to be compelling, albeit with more focus on CIA and its chief George Tenet. At times, I thought I was reading a Tom Clancy novel when the CIA paramilitary operatives Hank and Gary(1st names only for obvious reasons) undertake their clandestine operations with suitcases full of $3M to buy off the suspect Northern Alliance and Taliban commanders. I found it chock-full of interesting, and sometimes shocking insider info from the NSC meetings that made it completely worthwhile and quite a veritable page turner. As Woodward said on Larry King, thank goodness for the 1st Amendment or this stuff would not be available to the American public. Although the administration is most likely not overly pleased with the release of much of this previously classified information, we as the American public are priveleged to have Woodward so expertly pen this telling epic in American history.<P>Woodward has made a concerted effort to mainain a mostly objective and unbiased account of our prodigiously talented Commander in Chief, George W. Bush. That being said, this book does skew towards the Left moreso than I would prefer. All in all, worth a read for all who desire to delve deeper into the innerworkings of the White House.</span>

                    <span>It will take years for historians -- the real guardians of truth -- to have the perspective for an honest recounting of this particular story. Unfortunately, Woodward seems to have traded independent analysis for access to the players -- never a good bargain. Could not help cringe as the self-serving comments were dutifully recorded. Is this really the same author who co-wrote "All the President's Men?"</span>

                    <span>Bob Woodward's book is just plain dull. The only new insights he gives us relate to the CIA's pursuit of Osama bin Laden - a quest, we know now because of the Sept. 11 Hearings, doomed to miserable failure & miscommunication.<P>Most of Woodward's book is derived from interviews with President Bush, and all of them appear in Bush's favor. I understand Woodward is a journalist, and journalists, by nature, should strive to be objective. However, objectivity is a hard front to maintain when hundreds of U.S. soldiers are dying face-down in the sand overseas. I wanted more critical analysis on Woodward's part - I wanted his opinion. Perhaps I should've gone for a more liberal-leaning book instead of reading this trite from a seasoned journalist who made his name in the 1970's and hasn't quite lived up to the potential he acquired back then.<P>I have not read Woodward's newest book, which is supposed to be a wee bit more critical of the Bush administration. Nor do I really care to. In this new freedom of information age, and many aspiring journalists and documentarians digging up dirt nobody thought possible before, it's unrealistic to support an old codger who has made his name as being "the White House journalist."<P>Forget Woodward.</span>

                    <span>I was surprised when a friend of mine suggested this book to me, because he is very conservative and my impression was that this book was just another anti-bush rant. I was clearly wrong. I thought that this book was an insightful look into the President's War Cabinet. I did feel that Woodward was partial towards Powell over Rumsfeld. Overall, however, I thought that this book was excellently written and I would suggest this book to anyone wishing to learn more about the way that the Bush administration operates.</span>
