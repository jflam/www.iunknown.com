                    <span>Longer than "Tom Sawyer" and just chock full of the "n" word.  But the last pages, where Huck poses as Tom Sawyer and Tom as Sid, and they hatch plans, or rather Tom does, to free Jim from the Phelps, is flat-out hilarious.  I laughed out loud so many times.  Tom has read far too many swashbuckling adventures for his own (and Jim's) good.  Twain has amazing command of all the southern dialects, including the slave Jim's speech.  Jim may be free at the end, but sadly, his wife and children are not.  A wonderful story all around.  How much Twain loved the Missisippi is so evident in many beautiful and haunting passages of river life.  A word of advice:  you do need to read "Tom Sawyer" first.  "Huck Finn" is really a sequel, and many characters in the first book are referred to in the second. As The Great American Novel, I still think that nothing surpasses "To Kill A Mockingbird", but "Huck Finn" comes in at a close second.   </span>

                    <span>I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School and my English Teacher's endless lectures on this book did nothing to spoil my enjoyment of this great novel. In this  novel the reader is introduced to Huckleberry Finn, a young free spirited boy. Tired of the endles constraints of so called "Civilised Society" Huck "lights out" on a raft with his escaped slave friend Jim.What follows is a series of adventures with a few twists and turns in the plot which are all deftly handled by Mr. Twain. My English teacher had the criticism that the book was spoiled by the last few chapters when Jim becomes a steroetypical member of his Race. I believe that in doing this Mr. Twain was trying to point out to the reader that Huck and Jim were equals only when they were alone aboard their raft and as soon as the inevitaable demands of Society are placed on them Jim is no longer Huck's equal.This is a sad indictment on the concept of Society as it was back then. I never get tired of reading this book!!!</span>

                    <span>This book proved to me its title of "Great American Classic" the first time I read it.  It is an American story full of adventure, good laughs, and excellent social views.  Combined with a tough, yet relevant writing style that is fun to read, this novel is very enjoyable.  It starts off where Tom Sawyer's story left off, and moves quickly to the huge Mississippi River, where Huck teams with runaway slave Jim to escape his abusive father.  As they ride their raft down the current, they encounter many challenges that steathily frame what America has dealt with as it grew as a country.  Huck must overcome moral issues of slavery, lying, deception, his misunderstanding of religion, and the fact that his new best friend is black.  Despite these challenges, Huck and Jim form an amazing friendship in which they would do anything for one another.  Mark Twain keeps the story exciting by continuously giving Huck and Jim new adventures and problems they must deal with.  Huck grows to have a greater sense of himself and ultimately must decide between following the norm, or helping the person who needs him the most.</span>

                    <span>I read this book after enjoying reading Tom Sawyer to my 5-year old. Firstly, this book also stands out for its readability:  There is a flow and abundance of detail that pulls you in permanently.  This is due, in part, to its being written in the voice of a kid, of course, but we should also credit Twain's efficiency with language. Twain can plot through the logistics of a story, maintaining continuity and credibility (barely), but without getting bogged down with too much complexity.
<br />
<br />The characters are real and timeless.  The episode that convinced me that this was a great book happens early on: Huck's drunken, good-for-nothing dad goes on a tirade, blaming his woes on the guv'ment and the negroes. It's a perfect and timeless little slice of life and takes up barely a page. You could just see Twain thinking through all the little morals and wondering how he was going to include pieces of his philosophy in this story. Interesting thing about the Huck character:  He is not learned or wise, being young, he has a quick sense, he is conniving, he lies constantly, and yet, judged from a higher plane, he seems to be morally perfect!
<br />
<br />The author's admonition to the reader not to find motives or morals in the book is obviously just ironic bunkum.  This is Aesop's fables combined with Homer's Odyssey with a little Rousseau thrown in, brought up to date.</span>
