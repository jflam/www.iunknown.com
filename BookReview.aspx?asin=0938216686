                    <span>I am a Geologist and recently visited Grand Canyon National Park and hiked to Phantom Ranch. I did not buy this book as a field guide but as an educational tool. It is written in easy to understand format and parallels the educational level of PBS or the Discovery Channel. I suggest everyone who visits Grand Canyon NP add this book to their library. For detailed geology there are more advanced books or you can visit the Grand Canyon Association web page.</span>

                    <span>As can be seen from the previous reviews, whether one finds this book helpful really depends on what one is looking for. This is an excellent basic introduction to the geology of the Grand Canyon, with a preliminary background summary that places it in the context of plate tectonics, the movement of the North American continent northward from the equator through the Paleozoic Era, and the other major geologic forces that provided a backdrop for the deposition of the layers of sandstone, limestone and shale that we see today. Among its strong features are the imaginative illustrations that show the depositional environments through the geologic periods in which the various rock formations were laid down. The illustrations provide strong visual associations for learning the rock layers (Kaibab Formation, Coconino Sandstone, Redwall Limestone, etc.) that comprise the Grand Canyon. This isn't an advanced textbook, however, and someone looking for that would likely be disappointed. That doesn't mean that it's strictly for beginners, though. Even someone with a good background in Grand Canyon geology would appreciate the way this book ties everything together in a coherent and well-illustrated overview.</span>

                    <span>This book is not really that great. It is small and incomplete, the wrong size for taking into the field, and it doesn't hold up well(spine breaks and pages fall out). You are MUCH better off using an Audubon or Peterson guide. Save your money.</span>

                    <span>In addition to its beauty, the Grand Canyon offers a snapshot of earth's history in one place. This slim, concise, well-illustrated book is a great introduction to the formation and geological history of the Grand Canyon. It is short enough to read while you are at the canyon, or on the trip there. The writing is lucid, and no geology background is needed.</span>
