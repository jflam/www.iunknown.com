                    <span>Discovering Denali includes information on how to get to the park, what to see on the way, where to stay (including campsites, bed and breakfasts, hotels, motels), side trips and excursions, and tips for fishing, hiking, flightseeing and even climbing Mt. McKinley (also know as Denali, "the High One"). There are also bits of interesting history and folklore, extensive maps, and some personal insights by the author. It is the first and only source of information that provides detailed descriptions about the 43 individual sections of the park, including backpacking and camping information that heretofore has only been available upon arrival.</span>

                    <span>In my many treks to Denali, I have never Had to search for places and things that I had not explored- until I purchased this guide. The author brings to life the Park, as well as a reason to take the 'trail less traveled', as if there was a passion and connection with with the land that he so describes.</span>

                    <span>Very informative guide to one of the nation's largest national parks. Especially enjoyed the small chapter on the men, women and dogs of Denali. Also learned about the Moose Dropping Festival thanks to this book. The book also contains a calendar of events in and near the park.</span>

                    <span>Besides having information on the 43 sections of the park which no other book has, Discovering Denali also provides useful information on summer and winter activites in and around the park. Thanks to this book, My family discovered the delightful town of Talkeetna which is located just south of the park. My family and I also hiked around Denali State Park which we did not know about until we found it in this book. If you are visiting Alaska, I would also recommend the following books, The Milepost and Alaska's Best Places.</span>
