                <span id="Label1">Everyone knows about the kite and the key, the Declaration of Independence, and <I>Poor Richard's Almanac</I>, but nonscholars will find much to learn in this documentary tracing the epic of Benjamin Franklin's life. Using actors Dylan Baker and Richard Easton as Franklin speaking his own words, the makers of this PBS offering bring his writings to life without resorting to corny dramatizations. The documentary first explores his education as a minister, career as a printer, and retirement to a life of science at the age of 47. The second part explores his transformation to revolutionary: his life in England and eventual rejection of its domination, the resulting painful split with his son, and his colonial radicalism at age 70. The final chapter of his life takes place in France, where he operates with subterfuge to win France's support against the English and more or less invents diplomacy. <I>--Kimberly Heinrichs</I></span>

                    <span>If PBS found out what I learned from their "Smash Hit" DVD on Benjamin Franklin they would hire me to raise up the next level of young Benjamins in America.  
<br />
<br />GREAT LESSONS FOR ALL VIEWERS & ALMOST ALL AGES...
<br />The lessons in this DVD have been hidden from the general viewer because of Benjamin Franklins genius.  I have to date watched this DVD 12 times and I'm still extracting powerful revolutionary principles.  You just will not believe the things you will gain from watching this DVD but I challenge you to try.  As a teacher and educator of American History I was able to gain the following:
<br />
<br />*Historical accuracy was excellent!
<br />*Video production by Twin Cities Public TV was excellent
<br />*Acting was outstandingly superb!
<br />*Ellen Hovde & Muffie Meyer did a great job of producing.
<br />
<br />WHAT I EXTRACTED BUT I WON'T TELL IT ALL...
<br />On top of that I extracted many ingenious practical tips I have been applying in my own life that Ben used.  This video motivated me to write my book 52 Great Weeks to Unforgettable, Inspirational Service. 
<br />
<br />WHAT WILL YOU LEARN?
<br />You will learn where Ben began his life and how going to England changed his perspective.  You will find that Ben offers huge insight in every area from Marketing, to business, to Sales, to Writing and Publishing.
<br />
<br />I BROKE MY TV FAST TO WATCH THIS ONE
<br />This is one of my all time favorite things to watch and this is coming from a person who has been fasting from TV since 1998 because of all the trash on TV but a great DVD like this one is worth breaking my fast from TV.
<br />
<br />********** TEN STARS IS WHAT I WOULD GIVE IT...COME ON AMAZON---THIS WAS A GREAT DVD.

                    <span>This PBS documentary traces the epic life of Benjamin Franklin from his humble beginnings in Boston to his worldwide fame as a scientist, writer, Founding Father, and diplomat.  Originally premiered on PBS on November 19-20, 2002, the documentary breaks Franklin's life into three parts: <p>(1) "Let the Experiment Be Made" (1706-1753) looks at how Franklin quickly rose from his humble origins to become a prominent printer and publisher in Philadelphia.  He "retired" to become a gentleman of leisure and devote his time to studying the new science of electricity.  His discoveries not only freed the world from the harmful effects of lightning but also made him a major figure on the world stage.  Throughout the series, Franklin's scientific work, from inventing the Franklin stove to charting the Gulf Stream, keep popping up along with their importance at that time.<p>(2) "The Making of a Revolutionary" (1775-1776) finds Franklin moving to London where he ended up in the middle of the growing dispute between England and the American colonies.  The focus is on how this dispute turned Franklin, a loyal subject of the British empire who had his illegitimate son William made the Royal Governor of New Jersey, into a revolutionary who would return home to help draft the Declaration of Independence.  Keep in mind that this is happening in a world where getting a message back and forth across the Atlantic took weeks if not months.  <p>(3) "The Chess Master" (1776-1709) follows Franklin on the most important mission of his long life as he became the American diplomatic representative to France during the American Revolution.  Despite the less than helpful presence of John Adams and others, Franklin manages to play a pivotal role in getting France to recognize the new nation of the United States of America.  After the war, ends his public service helping to create the U.S. Constitution and being the only one of the Founding Fathers to actively campaign against the institution of slavery.<p>Narrated by Colm Feore, this documentary features Dylan Baker as the young Franklin and Richard Easton as the older version.  The major strength of the production is that it relies heaving upon Franklin's own writings and those of his contemporaries, which are performed by Baker, Easton and other actors addressing the camera.  Easton especially does a marvelous job of catching the wisdom behind Franklin's wit and even his righteous anger when somebody gets on his bad side.  The result is that Easton ranks with Howard de Silva ("1776") in the first rank of those who have portrayed Franklin on screen.  There are also talking heads, such as Gordon Wood (whose "The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin" I read last year), who providing historical insights and perspective.  But mostly you are going to remember what Ben tells you (e.g., the story of paying too much for the whistle), and have a much better sense of both the man and his accomplishments after spend 3 ½ hours watching this documentary.<p>There is a short featurette on the making of the series and some program "outtakes," which consist of more examples of talking heads, primarily Franklin, reciting various writings (apparently the people at PBS are so sheltered they do not know these would be better characterized as deleted scenes, or at least excerpts).  As is the case with most PBS DVD Videos you can go to their excellent website for "Benjamin Franklin" and find a Teacher's Guide and other Resources for teachers and students to learn more about Franklin.</span>

                    <span>This is a superbly entertaining documentary capturing the brilliance, boldness, and bawdiness of Ben Franklin. It covers Franklin's rise to wealth as a businessman who, among other things, established perhaps the first organization for young entrepeneurs to network.  It chronicles his role as a scientist (experimenting with electricity) and inventor (e.g., the Franklin stove and bifocals).  Then we see how Franklin's role as diplomat helped secure the American colonies' success in freeing themselves from British rule.  This documentary captures both Franklin's genius and his impishness. Franklin was a shrewd strategist who achieved his aims through calculation, perseverance, and a nimble wit. Not the typical marble statue portrayal of one of our founding fathers, "Benjamin Franklin," shows the real flesh and blood character of Franklin who was nothing if not colorful.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite documentaries to date. The acting is top notch for the young Franklin, the elder Franklin, and others in Franklin's life. Re-enactments and unique footage fill the majority of scenes instead of musty paintings or drawings. The whole documentary has a fresh and witty feel.<p>What impressed me most, though, was how clearly and informatively the documentary sets out the life of Franklin, his character, and his effect on early America and the world. Not only is he revealed as a genius and a founding father, he is shown as a humorous man and the quintessential American. Franklin displays all the unique traits that define the American character, from the refusal to accept social status as fixed by birth to the constant search for scientific truths.<p>Two parts, both excellent. The documentary should have great appeal to any age with even the vaguest interest in American history.</span>
