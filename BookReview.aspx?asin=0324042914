                    <span>Any person beginning a new start-up should pick this up before they get much further than an idea. Though geared towards the major legal issues involved in starting a company, this book covers many of the essentials of  beginning and structuring a business far better than most of the other  books on financing or building start-ups. I've at least looked through a  dozen books on the subject and none has had better, more explicit guidance  on dividing founder's equity, options, funding relationship and so much  more. I cannot recommend this book highly enough; you'll be at a  disadvantage without it. You can view other reviews of entrepreneur books  via my reviewer profile.</span>

                    <span>highly readable and informative primer on basic business law principles and their application within the context of early stage and maturing companies (from day one of the business to ipo). its use of examples is  also excellent.  chapter 13 (Human Resources) was particularly helpful --  the information on employment issues and the sample work agreement forms  are enormously helpful. <p>i recommend reading this book before quiting  your corporate job and starting your own company -- the 2nd chapter of the  book, "Leaving Your Employer," highlights certain legal  restrictions that may save the entrepreneur from potential headaches in the  future involving their former employer.</span>

                    <span>I found this book be very insightful.  Many people that start businesses rarely think of the broad legal ramifications of their business activities.  This book clearly sets forth basic business and legal concepts that ALL  persons entering into a business venture should consider before they begin  operations.<p>Individuals with a legal or business background may find much  of the information obvious, but to the vast majority of readers, this book  is a must, if they are considering launching their own business.</span>
