                <span id="Label1">A sleeper when released in 1985, <I>The Journey of Natty Gann</I> has since become an enduring family classic. While following a familiar Disney formula (the perilous adventures of a girl and her pet wolf), director Jeremy Paul Kagan adds something fresh at every turn, aided by a first-rate cast and beautifully scenic locations. Then-promising newcomer Meredith Salenger is perfect in the title role--a scrappy kid in Depression-era Chicago who travels cross-country to the Pacific Northwest, hoping to find her father (Ray Wise), who had been forced to leave her with an awful landlady while he took a logging job in Washington. Natty befriends the wolf and a fellow drifter (John Cusack, in an early role), and her journey is a memorable one, intense and realistic but still appropriate for kids. Although Salenger's subsequent film career has been modest (she later graduated <I>cum laude</I> from Harvard), <I>Natty Gann</I> remains a worthy claim to fame. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>This is a little-known Disney movie that is probably one of the studio's best live-action films. This was one of my childhood favorites, and, when I saw it again recently, it became one of my adulthood favorites.<P>The story takes place in the midst of the Great Depression and starts out in Chicago. Natty and her father are struggling to make ends meet, but still manage to love each other and survive. Trouble comes when Natty's father finally gets a job - in Washington. Unable to find Natty to tell her, he leaves her a note and leaves her in the charge of an overbearing boardinghouse owner. Fed up with bad treatment and not wanting to believe that her father abandoned her, Natty sets out to meet up with her father, hopping on trains and hitching rides west. Along the way, she helps free a wolf who is being used in dog fights. She and the wolf meet up later and become companions. Natty also joins up with John Cusack, another drifter looking for work. <P>The movie includes beautiful scenery and an interesting portrayal of Depression-era America. The relationships are also fascinating. For instance, Natty only calls the wolf "wolf," and still recognizes that he is a wild animal. In other words, she doesn't attempt to make him into a pet. Additionally, her relationship with John Cusack's character is not silly, self-conscious, or filled with expectation. <P>Another reviewer noted that the DVD version of this movie is disappointing. I found the quality of my DVD to be absolutely fine. There are no special features, but the film itself is of decent quality. <P>This is a sweet, fascinating movie that is appropriate for children and adults and should immediately be considered a classic.</span>

                    <span>A good period piece about people struggling to find work during the depression. When Natty's father leaves Chicago, Illinois and goes to Seattle, Washington for a job at a lumber camp he leaves her behind. He misses her when he has to leave so he tells her in a letter he will send for her. When she decides she can't wait she strikes out on her own. She runs into John Cusack's character and helps a wolf escape from a dogfighting ring. Her adventure getting to her father is difficult and enriching. She travels the rails and highways to get there. A little slow in parts but overall a decent family movie. If only Disney had thought enough of this movie to make a good transfer to DVD. I was appalled at how bad it was during the opening credits. The credits jumped around on the screen. The rest of the movie was not as bad as that but it was a little grainy, not clear and sharp like we usually see with Disney films. That probably explains why I have seen it selling for what it is sold here or less.</span>

                    <span>I recently saw this movie again on cable, and concur with other reviewers that the dvd is a waste of time. This movie is a rarity for family fare in that it is uncompromising and un-sappy. It treats the depression theme in a very mature way, but the journey itself transcnds what could be a very dark and somber mood throughout the movie. Interesting to me that it was all filmed no more than 15 km. from my neighbourhood in Vancouver . Seeing it for the second time 20 years later, I got to see a small slice of my past- the old train station, the law courts building, etc.</span>

                    <span>Parents, beware, this movie is not for your children. The majestic scenery is overshadowed by a gloomy outlook, grotesque swearing (including taking the Lord's Name in vain several times), and the point of view that all adults in leadership are evil. Trust me, this is one for the trash can. That's where my copy is.</span>

                    <span>Once in a great while you see a film that really leaves you speechless. I had been aware of this film for many years, but only recently watched it on a cable TV station. It's the kind of movie that transcends age, gender, time and place. The story is so great and the acting is just superb! Meredith Salenger stars as the title character and she's does such a wonderful job that you forget you're actually watching a movie. It's the kind of film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's too bad that Disney didn't do a better job with the DVD edition, since this movie is a real gem. I give it the highest rating!</span>
