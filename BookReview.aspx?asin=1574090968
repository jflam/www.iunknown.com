                    <span>Great book, with provisions... For someone with some previous knowledge about boat building, design and terminology this can be a very enjoyable and inspiring book. The boats covered in this book cover a broad range of types, for paddle, oar, sail and power. The information on them however ranges from brief descriptions with hand drawn scetches to fairly complete plans with offsets suitable for someone with previous knowledge of boatbuilding to be able to build from. One would not expect all of the boats to be fully described in plans because some of the boats are not the authors own designs but are included to illustrate the authors experience or modifications of the design. The book was well worth the modest price for me for the one design alone, the 9 foot "Dandy Dingy" which is one of the ones with adequate plans. This boat looks to be fairly easy to build and cute as could be.</span>

                    <span>Author rambles on about various old designs and the philosophies of the designers/builders, interspersing a few fuzzy B&W pictures and snippets of hull profiles. Might be interesting to the history buff, but if you want clear, relevant information on how to build a wooden boat... this book isn't for you. There are many others to choose from - I'd recommend Buehler's Backyard Boat Building and Gerr's Strength of Boats as two helpful books I've read so far.</span>

                    <span>It follows the style of Mr. Jones prior book "Low Resistance Boats/ Boats to Go". It is informative on the different methods of building boats and the advantages and disadvantages. It is especially informative to those like myself who often ponder building a wooden boat and have pre-conceived notions that we are going to use "traditional methods". Tom has tried a great variety of methods and candidly admits that some of his pre-conceived notions and methods did not always turn out as he expected. He also describes how modern methods and materials can be used to build boats with a tradional appeal and why traditional is traditional and not always practical.</span>
