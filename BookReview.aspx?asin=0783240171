                <span id="Label1">The most acclaimed motion picture of 1985 stars Robert Redford and Meryl Streep in one of the screen&#146;s great epic romances.  Directed by Oscar winner Sydney Pollack, Out of Africa is the fascinating true story of Karen Blixen, a strong-willed woman who, with her philandering husband (Klaus Maria Brandauer), runs a coffee plantation in Kenya, circa 1914.  To her astonishment, she soon discovers herself falling in love with the land, its people and a mysterious white hunter (Redford).  The masterfully crafted, breathtakingly produced story of love and loss earned Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Screenplay (based on material from another medium), Cinematography, Original Score, Art Direction (Set Decoration) and Sound.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This Sydney Pollack film is a work of sumptuous beauty, the colors of the vast land that is Africa a backdrop to an equally gorgeous romance that itself is tied to a continent. This is Karen Blixen's true story of her time in Kenya and her romance with a mecurial hunter who lives with Africa, rather than in it. Karen would leave her spirit and her soul on the wide open plains of this beautiful land, which is the real star of this lush and most romantic of films. Robert Redford and Meryl Streep are both marvelous in this elegant banquet of love and beauty.<P> Karen embarks on a journey to Africa after a marriage of convenience to an old friend, which will turn sour shortly after their arrival to their coffee plantation, payed for with her money. His unfaithfulness will bring about an illness that will force her to return home for treatment, or go insane. She has met Dennis already, however, and fallen in love with a land and its people, and knows she must come back.<P> The romance of Karen and the enigmatic Dennis is languid, like the plains, and their differences vast, like the orange evening skyline. She starts a school to teach the tribal children english and feels ties to her coffee farm, but he has been in Africa a long time, and knows all those there are just passing through. He roams the plains and knows no ownership, at least not the kind Karen needs.<P> A flight over Kenya set to John Barry's beautiful Oscar winning score is one of those magical moments in film never to be forgotten. Karen, who would later write of these things under the name, Isak Dinesen, would describe it as "A glimpse of the World from God's eye." This majestic offering has a breathtaking scope only a handful of films can compare to. It is a visual feast for the eyes, and the answer for the hearts of all those wondering where romance has gone.</span>

                    <span>The most honored movie of 1985, "Out of Africa" is indeed an outstanding cinematic achievement. It works on every level imaginable: as an historical epic; as an adventure; as a biography; as a poignant romance. The film's success is partly attributable to many fine elements which blend together seamlessly: its script, direction, sets, cinematography, performances, and editing are each masterful accomplishments. <P>These individual virtues are given synergy by two outstanding achievements that together form the movie's backbone and provide its true heart and soul. One is the sensitive performance of the radiant Meryl Streep, who dominates both in terms of screen time and charisma; the other is the exquisite, majestic score by John Barry. Actor and composer complement each other perfectly. The famous flying sequence in which his music underscores the emotions flashing across her face is a superb example of cinema at its best: it invites the viewer's spirit to soar.<P>Happily, the DVD presentation of this gem is a treasure in itself. The video transfer is sharp and clear, with a fairly subtle transition between the dual-layers of the disc, and the sound is well-balanced and crisp, a definite improvement over the LaserDisc and VHS releases. There are fantastic extras offered on the DVD, including the advance theatrical trailer and a director's audio commentary. I especially enjoyed the documentary on the making of the film, which featured recent interviews with Streep, Barry, and director Sydney Pollack, intercut with behind-the-scenes footage taken during filming. All-in-all, this is a marvelous edition of a much-beloved film, and a worthy addition to your DVD library.</span>

                    <span>This is the worst film ever to win the best picture Oscar.<BR>All the beautiful cinematography is wasted on a trite plot and tepid performances. When you start to probe further into the rationale of the characters and look for any real themes, the search turns up dust. Out of Africa is as empty as a blind man's sockets. It seems to have something there, but it lies.<P>To see the same type of film, but with real characters, interesting thematic elements and powerful direction, watch The English Patient. <P>God, I want my 3 hours back! AHHHHHHH! Die Stupid Movie!!!!!</span>

                    <span>If you're a Sydney Pollack fan you'll sure enjoy this film. Out of Africa, besides the excellent performances of Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, will certainly get your attention with the astonishing landscapes of Africa. <BR>The story is about the life of Karen Blixen, who gets married for convenience and moves to Africa where she starts running a plantation. Things start to go wrong when her husband starts being absent often and cheating on her. Karen, eventually, falls for a hunter, Dennis, but she demands more of the relationship than he is ready to offer. For Dennis his freedom is essential and in the end you're faced with the unexpected. <BR>You can also count on an extraordinary soundtrack and photography, so it is a film that is really worth seeing!</span>

                    <span>I assumed that any film that rampaged through the Oscars the way this one did would be rewarding on so many levels. I must be missing something. What I saw was a beautifully filmed but rather ponderous vehicle to two mega-stars who circle around each other like glittering birds that do not want to muss their magnificent plumages. Emotionally, I have rarely found a "romantic" film to be so totally bereft of passion or emotion.<P>I feel this is largely due to Robert Redford playing Robert Redford pretending to be Finch-Hatton. He just seems to so totally out of place in this film, and I really could care less about his accent. He just never seems to be anything other than Robert Redford. In any case, his character, supposedly a free thinker who is more in touch with the Higher Truths that Nature offers, comes off as as a self-absorbed character who never met an emotion he couldn't throw a wall around. The relationship between Finch-Hatton & Blixen comes off as being so frigid & lifeless that I simply could not relate to it on any level.<P>Meanwhile, the film lumbers along through the Great War (with the producers assuming that viewers are all well acquainted with WWI in East Africa), treating us to great scenic shots. Yes indeed, the cinematography is great in this film. All the Brits saddle up, presumably to do battle with von Lettow-Vorbeck, and off they go. Then they saddle up, and off they go to someplace else. They spend a great deal of time going off to some distant spot or another. Eventually some people die, as they are wont to do, and then some more people die. One of them ends up being Robert Redford, which proves most inconvenient for the story line, and so the movie lumbers towards its end shortly thereafter.<P>This is not a terrible film by any means. I find the performance of Michael Kitchen (a fine actor who deserves more notice) as Berkeley Cole to be most noteworthy. Also, the cinematography is quite breath-taking and goes a long ways towards redeeming the movie as a whole. I also derived great amusement (not intended by the producers) of watching the not exactly diminutive Michael Gough play the (in real life) itty-bitty Hugh Cholmondeley, Lord Delamere. I laughed every time Delamere was in a scene.<P>Is it a good film? I suppose so. Is it a great film? I don't see how one can really say that. Is it the most overrated film to win a slew of Oscars? Hardly --- let's not forget "Titanic" and "Around the World in 80 Days," just to name a few. It is an OK film. I guess I was just disappointed because I went into it with higher expectations.</span>
