                    <span>To start the process of understanding strategic planning, you need to take some courses, speak to lots of people, try quite a few things out (many of which will be dead ends) and read quite a few books.  The books need to be mulled over for quite some time, and from the morass of conflicting information, you pull out something useful.  
<br />
<br />Now, what books should you read?  Clearly, I haven't read, nor am I ever likely to read them all, but, Strategic Planning for Non Profit Organizations is definitely one of them.
<br />
<br />It is indeed a practical guide which serves everyone well in nonprofits and is eminently adaptable to Profit and Govenrnmental organisations.
<br />
<br />The pages I went back to constantly included that containing the map of the strategic planning process (p11 1997 edition) and The Language of Planning table and explanations (P16-17).  They represent an excellent summary after reading the book.
<br />
<br />After my third read, when I had a greater appreciation of the context in which planning is done, I thought it might even be THE text that everyone looks for, but, alas, it crashed and burned at one crucial point which is why I only give it 4 stars.  As with all books of this type it did the "hand-waving, hey presto trick" in attempting to join two critical components - core strategies and programs.  One moment we get to core strategies - no problems (Step 4.3, p116-123).  A few sections later we get to writing goals and objectives for programs (Step 4.6 p130-143). There should have been a more explicit section on how the programs relate to the strategies.  The reason this can't be done is that any given program relates to more than one strategy and invariably, all books on strategy stick to the hierarchical model (not a network model).  The assumption is always one of mutually exclusive categories because that makes things easier.
<br />
<br />Now each of these sections, individually, have a wealth of useful information.  It's the relationship between them that's the problem.   The join was not only not smooth, it was not existent.  Not to worry, other books which I have read have solved this problem only to create a different problem elsewhere - which is why you need to read a suite of books to get proper context.
<br />
<br />Despite everything I have said, it really is a great book.  I will certainly be using it time and time again into the future because of the wealth of insight it contains.</span>

                    <span>I used the first edition of this book in a graduate class on Strategic Planning this past summer. This book is a wonderful, complete, and sufficient introduction to strategic planning. Everything in the book is completely clear. Doing the exercises in this book are a perfect way to learn sound strategic planning methodology. The first edition was simply excellent. I am certain that the authors have made every effort to improve the book even further. The revised edition is a certain 5. </span>

                    <span>I have reviewed most of the strategic planning books for nonprofit organizations, and this is the best I have seen--no contest. It avoids the simplistic "easy as pie" approach of other planning books, but is nonetheless clear, logical and easy to follow. It recommends methodologies for protracted planning processes and much more modest efforts. The worksheets are terrific and it's great having them on disk for easy duplication. </span>

                    <span>The problem with so many books that deal with this subject matter is that they talk a lot of great theory but fall short when it comes to bringing things down to earth.  This book, however, succeeds on both accounts.  It offers not only a concrete step-by-step format, but solid rationales for the "why" question.  Templates for the various forms that can be used with your group are an extra plus.  Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent guide to developing a strategic plan, from conception to execution. While emphasizing the fact that the process is messy and nonlinear, this book enables one to take the first step, plan to plan, and decide how indepth the focus needs to be. There is appropriate emphasis on the need to develop mission and vision, and detailed worksheets for every question that may be relevant to your organization's situation. The diskette provides all the templates for putting it together. Highly recommended.</span>
