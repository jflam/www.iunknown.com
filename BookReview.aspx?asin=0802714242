                <span id="Label1">One of mankind's greatest treasures, the Amber Room stood as a symbol of Russian glory for over two hundred years. But after the Nazi invasion, it was never seen again. <br><br> Now, in a masterpiece of detection, investigative journalists Catherine Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy have at last unraveled the jumble of evidence surrounding the Amber Room's fate. Journeying through the former Soviet bloc, and exploring archives in St. Petersburg and Berlin, they reveal what happened to the most valuable lost treasure in the world-and why the truth has been withheld for so long. Their revelations have broken a conspiracy of lies by the Russians who, for decades, have blamed the Amber Room's disappearance on the widespread looting of Nazi Germany, rather than face the shocking truth.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I knew absolutely nothing about the subject (though I consider myself fairly well-educated, despite being from Texas). I took it to Mexico with me and read it in just a couple of days on the beach. I could hardly put it down. Last weekend, I was privileged to go to the Book Expo meeting in Chicago, where I had the pleasure of meeting the authors. They have done a superb job of covering this complex story. It's easily the best thriller I have read in years. And I learned quite a lot about Russian and Soviet politics through the centuries as well.</span>

                    <span>Who needs fiction when hisory can give us stories like this! The Amber room was in the Catherine Palace in Pushkin, outside of Leningrad (today's St. Petersburg). The room was lined with amber panels that Frederick I of Prussia gave to Peter the Great in 1717. The panels vanished when the Nazis invaded in 1941 and have never been seen again. The two journalist writers do a great job of covering the history of the room and the consperacy theories that surround. This is a much better read then Da Vinci code and this story is real. The only downfall is there is no satisfying conclusion to this book as the Amber room is still missing! If you insist on fiction may I recomend "A Tourist in the Yucatan" an interesting thriller.</span>

                    <span>As the saying goes: - 'who needs fiction with history like this'. At last the first non-fiction history of the Amber room. This is not the Berry book refered to above, but the first history in english of the famed Amber Rooms of the catherine palace, St Petersburg russia. The jewel of 18th century Russia had amber walls, valued by weight alone at $100-150million dollars. Originally based in Berlin, they were given as a gift to Peter the Great while on his great Tour of Europe in the early 18th century. Upon his return to russia, the amber panels lay in storage for some years. It was eventually the enlightened monarch Catherine the Great who ordered her gifted architect, Francesco Rastrelli to design a bigger and more magnificent ammber room in the longest palace in the world at Tsarskoye Selo outside St Petersburg. The room was then filled with magnificent amber objects. And there the room was to stay until 1941 when the Germans arrived at the palace. Although covered by the Russians with wall paper, the Germans discovered the room and shipped it to East Prussia's Koenigsberg Castle (now the Russian city of Kaliningrad) Nobody is really sure what happened the amber room, but it vanished in 1945, probably destroyed in the allied bombing. Fortunately the amber room is now fully restored, with help from the russian customs and German ruhr gas company. I was lucky enough to see it last year in time for the 300th anniversary. I always wanted a history in english but could only ever manage a few pamphlets in russian or German. This book will be treasured alongside my photos of the new Amber Room. If you want a gripping read.... then this is the book for u</span>
