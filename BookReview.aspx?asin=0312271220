                    <span>In her latest novel, "Girls in Trouble", Caroline Leavitt explores the timeless themes of teenage pregnancy, adoption, and first love, in the story of Sara, a pregnant sixteen year old, who offers her unborn child for an open adoption to two middle aged professionals, George and Eva. The arrangement fails, and we follow Sara for the next half of her life in her search for truth and validation.<P>This book will resonate with anyone who remembers their first encounter with love. Caroline Leavitt weaves a dense and lyrical tale of Sara and Danny, latter day 'star crossed lovers', whose love is condemned by both their families. She portrays strong and convincing characters in this fearful interplay between the lovers, their disparaging families, and their daughter and her adoptive parents. The drama continues for the next 16 years. The choices that all the players live out, are relentless in their progress away from that original fusion, the perfect love of two teenagers, that can never be.<P>It's a wonderful read, enjoy!<P>Val Harbolovic</span>

                    <span>Push aside other reading, put to-do lists on hold, and rush to read this book! I've been a fan of Caroline Leavitt since I read Coming Back to Me two years ago. Immediately, I read more of her books, all poignant, all lovely. But this book, Girls in Trouble, my goodness, what a powerful tale! I started reading late one evening, knowing I hadn't the time to finish. But the engaging story and fluid prose pulled me into the world of Sara, Danny, Anne, et al., and I was hooked. I stayed up very late and woke up early. I had important things to do - I postponed them. When I had no choice but to set the book down, I fretted about the characters until I could return. <P>Leavitt has woven a subtle spell. I didn't realize how far I'd gone under until I reached the ending chapters, where I was astounded by how much I cared about these characters. I understood each of their motives, their flaws, their blind spots. I also knew their hearts. I loved and respected them all. First I cried for their longing and their seemingly unsolvable problems. Then I cried for the beauty of their strengths. Ultimately, the wiseness of young Sara and Danny, the force and depth of their love for one another and their daughter, rang so true that the characters have refused to let go of me.<P>My husband and I have five sons, ages 18 to 28. We've been happily surprised by our good fortune to have had no unplanned pregnancies. How would we have handled them if we had? Sadly, I doubt we'd have given our kids enough credit for their innate wisdom nor would we have known the full profundity of their needs. Girls in Trouble should be required reading for parents and teens alike. We all can learn so much from this no BS story. It's pitch-perfect. No sloppy sentimentalism, no cold analysis - just the truth from every angle, as real as fiction can be, and as only fiction, at its best, can shed light on reality. We parents can get so overwhelmed with responsibility that it's far too easy to remain clueless about the inner workings of our children and to be dogmatic with out discipline and advice. But their loves and losses are every bit as real and significant to them as ours are to us. Real love cannot/will not be buried or denied and, indeed, is the only thing that saves us. Girls in Trouble makes all of this extremely clear without once preaching, but instead by revealing it in the telling of the tale. Leavitt is supremely artful as storyteller, never letting herself get in the way. Extremely difficult to craft and amazingly well-done! <P>Would that we could all be as wise as Caroline Leavitt! Would that I could write like her! Read Girls in Trouble. You will not be disappointed. You'll meet characters whom you will never forget and whose story will impact the way you think and live.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. I started it and immediatly got sucked in. The story is so raw and beautifully written. I could not stand putting the book down. Caroline Leavitt knows how to write about a touchy issue with great knowledge and care. The characters are so rich and full of depth. There are no winners or losers in the book. It is easy to identify and support each character in the choices that they make, even if the choices are not easy or what would be deemed by some as the right choices to make. "Girls in Trouble" is wonderful, and I wish the story never ended. It is a beautiful read. Flawless.</span>

                    <span>Girls in Trouble was one of the best, most engrossing novels I have read in a while. The pain felt by both Sara and Eva and George is so real I could feel a heavyness in my chest while I read this book (even sneaking a quick page or two at work). Several parts broke my heart, but it was a pretty real idea book. Not much sugar coating. The only think I sort of secretly wished was for Sara to have been able to gotten back together....call me a hopeless romantic fool. R</span>

                    <span>...Barbara Kingsolver! Girls in Trouble grabbed me the way the Bean Trees did. Only this isn't Caroline Leavitt's first novel, you've got 7 more to enjoy after she hooks you with the latest. I do not use the word "hooks" lightly. I read Girls in Trouble on a flight from Los Angeles to Denver, and for the first time in my over travelled life was disappointed that the flight was not longer, long enough at least to finish this gripping story. Most every one has asked themselves a question that begins with, "How would I feel if..." and most women have asked themselves the question, "How would I feel if I got pregnant?" "What would I do?" It is admittedly one of the most personally and politically charged questions of our time. In Girls in Trouble, Caroline Leavitt involves us in the both agonizing and joyful struggle of one girl's attempt to answer it. For immediate purchase and enjoyment only.</span>
