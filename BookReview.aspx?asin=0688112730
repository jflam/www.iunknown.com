                <span id="Label1">The voices of the game's distant past continue to reverberate with a distinct freshness in Lawrence S. Ritter's <i>The Glory of Their Times.</i> An oral history of the game in the first two decades of the century, <i>Glory</i> sends out its impressive roster of players to tell their own stories, and what stories they tell--the story of their times as well as of their game; the scorecard includes Rube Marquard, Babe Herman, Stan Coveleski, Smoky Joe Wood, and Wahoo Sam Crawford. A delight from cover to cover, <i>Glory</i> is the next best thing to having been there in the days when the ball may have been dead, but the personalities were anything but.</span>

                    <span>I've been a baseball fan for as long as I can remember (40+ years) and have read a number of great baseball books during that span.  "The Glory of Their Times" certainly ranks with any of them.  Lawrence Ritter traveled the countryside in the 1960's to interview and record the thoughts of some of baseball's greats from the early 20th Century.  His goal was simple:  record the anecdotes and thoughts from these great players before it was too late.  He definitely achieved his goal.
<br />
<br />Ritter allows the players to do the "writing" of the book by just holding the microphone in place and editing the volumes of information that he gathered from these former stars.  Most of the names (Waner, Greenberg, Goslin, Wood) will be familar to baseball fans, but even the obscure (Leach, Austin, Lobert, Torpocer) are given their due.  The stories don't just revolve around the baseball careers of these players. Snippets of what life was like in our country between the two great wars can be found here as well.  In that regard, any reader who appreciates history or good human interest stories will enjoy "The Glory of Their Times" as well.
<br />
<br />The photos that accompany the book are just as impressive as the stories themselves.  There are a number of pictures of other baseball greats not featured in the book including, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson and Honus Wagner, just to name a few.
<br />
<br />Reading "The Glory of Their Times" is a great nostalgic trip into baseball's early history and I give it my highest recommendation!
<br />Enjoy!

                    <span>Sometimes the best histories are the ones where the participants in that history are allowed to talk and the history's author just listens. Such is the case with this book. And oh the stories these old ballplayers tell. Stories of an era in baseball from long ago: what it was like to play with Honus Wagner or Ty Cobb or Lou Gehrig; what it was like to play for John Mcgraw; or get a new persepctive on an infamous play like the Fred Snodgrass muff or a dropped ball that led to a World Series win. And funny how you get a sense too from reading this book of what life and the people in it were like back in the early part of the 20th century, as well as what the baseball was like. I was highly entertained and intrigued from the moment I opened the book to reading the last page in it. And I'm thankful the author thought to preserve this era for all of us before it was too late.<p>Dick Dobbins used this "oral history" approach to great advantange in his now out of print book about the old Pacific Coast League called The Grand Minor League. It's an approach I used to a lesser extent some years ago when I wrote a history of a local volunteer group in the late 1990s.<p>I've wanted to read this for years, and I'm glad I did. If this isn't the greatest baseball book of all time, it's pretty darn close.</span>

                    <span>It is awesome to hear the real old-timers talk about baseball's early days. They are old enough to be candid, to be sure. The interviewer does an admirable job of staying in the background, asking prompting questions only when needed and these are show his excellent preparation without making him seem like he's their (baseball) equal.<br>My only complaint, having heard this on CD (and I did that because I very much wanted to hear their actual voices) was that the audio was not done too well, mostly too faint except on extreme volume settings. Anyway, it was definitely worth the effort.</span>

                    <span>I read once that Lawrence Ritter decided to research and write The Glory of Their Times when he realized that the great players of the dead ball era were dying off. He wanted to preserve their memories while it was still possible. He did us all a favor - The Glory of Their Times is one of the finest books ever written about baseball history. Ritter was a good oral historian - he knew how to draw his subjects out. Where else can you read first-hand accounts of what it was like to play with Ty Cobb?</span>
