                <span id="Label1">A new edition of the only guide to detail all the known routes on 570 peaks in the Sierras, thoroughly updated, with 60+ pages of new material covering 80 new routes, and new photos throughout.   <P>The diverse terrain and unspoiled wilderness of the High Sierra makes it one of the best places in the world for "the practice of mountains" - advanced hiking, cross-country rambling, peak bagging, rock and ice climbing, and ski touring. Here it is possible to begin a hike in the desert of the eastern Sierra, scale rock and ice to a mountain top, and end in the lush redwood groves of the western slopes.  <P>The most comprehensive resource on this explorer's paradise, The High Sierra details all the major and minor routes to the area and covers approach roads, trails, and cross-country and climbing routes. Sections called "Wrinkles" provide alternative and lesser-known linkage routes between and within regions.</span>

                    <span>If you want to climb as many peaks as possible in the High Sierra, this is your book. Secor describes an enormous number of different hiking/climbing opportunities. He does not bother with the most obvious stuff, such as well-known trails that are easy to find, but instead tells you about places you might not have thought about. There is information on cross-country routes (such as George Creek, Tuttle Creek, and the Enchanted Gorge), which is important because these rough and difficult routes are not discussed in trail guides, and are also overlooked in climbing guides. This book might not be enough information for doing a technical climb on a big wall like Lone Pine Mountain or Tehipite Dome, but will tell you about the approach routes. This is useful if you want to get a good look at these mountains from some neighboring ridge, but don't necessarily want to scale the actual cliffs. It is better for wilderness trekking, off-trail hiking, and mountaineering than it is for pure wall climbing. It is therefore an ideal guide for people who want to cover a lot of ground and see some extremely remote and beautiful scenery rather than stay at one site and go up and down a wall.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent guide to California's Sierra Nevada. Secor provides a great range of reliable information. The first time I depended on him, I came to a high pass and wondered if it really was the class 2 he claimed (doable without equipment and great risk of falling off). It looked harder. I cautiously decided to give it a try--and he was right. His descriptions are brief, but sufficiently precise to be useful. Anyone hiking in the Sierra will want this book</span>

                    <span>For anyone who spends time rambling around the High Sierra, this book is indispensable. It talks about cross-country routes, peaks, and "wrinkles" you cannot find information about anywhere else. If someone is looking for detailed routes and/or descriptions, you need to use another reference. Due to the area that this book covers, if it included more details that some desire, it would be several volumes. It is intended for the serious backpacker and peak-bagger...not specifically for technical climbs, but this book does get you going in the right direction.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book before heading out to the SF bay area for a summer project last year. I mainly used descriptions of off-trail routes to do some 1-day scrambles on various peaks in the Sierra as well as for an excursion off the John Muir trail on a backpacking trip through King's Canyon NP. <BR>This book is meant for off-trail travel and technical climbing (and mostly the latter). If you really only want to stick to the trail it's the wrong guide, but the nice thing about the Sierra is that it's easy to leave the trail. I'm not a technical climber, but because the book is very comprehensive there's still lots of interesting stuff for me. It has shown me a side of the Sierrra that, being not familiar with this part of the US at all, I probably would not have seen otherwise.</span>

                    <span>Don't buy this book before flipping through it. If you're looking for a climbing guide along the lines of the typical area book, you'll be disappointed -- nothing in the way of route topos, and minimal route descriptions in many cases.<P>If, however, you're looking to get into the wilderness and do some adventure climbing/heavy hiking, this book is perfect. Secor must assume his readers are intelligent and have the necessary skills for backcountry travel, navigation and route finding.<P>The book is best as a general trip planning guide that one may supplement with other sources of information where more detail is wanted. Wouldn't take it on the trail with me, due to weight.</span>
