                    <span>This is a good book for what I used it for, which is a few quick and dirty VBA apps in Excel. Beginners can easily pick it up and go with the information in this book. If you want to get heavier into development, you may want something with a few more code examples, and better explanations as to what is going on. This book is very good however, and presenting information for creating specific projects. </span>

                    <span>I am a programmer and frequently work with many people that are not. This book is great to grab the CD and share a concept or share an idea. The entire book is on CD-ROM in the back of the book that by the way is in PDF format so that you can enlarge it to almost 400 percent (so much for readability issues). <p>I thought initially that this book was highly duplicitous of its brother book Excel Data Analysis by the same company. There are some areas that overlap but I will pass on criticism.<p>Every example has the initial worksheet and the solved or worked through example on the included cd-rom. <p>If there is any room they could have done better with, is using a larger font and pulling out what example they are using from the top of the excel worksheet onto the page. Therefore, when you open to the topic of "Record a Macro" they would have had "Budget Worksheet" example in the same font size next to it. As it currently is, there is a bit of eyestrain but it is not that bad.</span>

                    <span>The worst computer book I have ever seen. I am only a PhD in science but I couldn't understand anything and the figures were too small to read. This book has almost convinced me to give up on visual basic which seems to be a very difficult thing to learn.<p>Donald Rapp</span>

                    <span>This book is very beginner oriented.  All of the explanations target one basic function in Excel, but never are they all tied together in a more complex example.  There were also several grammatical errors, which add to the amatuerish nature of the text.<br>If you're looking to do very simple things with your Spreadsheets, then this will do the job, but otherwise, look elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>Excellent book for people who need to learn the two object models quickly while providing a strait to the point explanation, and an example of how to use it in you project. <p>This has to be one of the best self-study books around.</span>
