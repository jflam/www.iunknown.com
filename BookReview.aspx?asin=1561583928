                    <span>I already have my heart set on 3 or 4 of the cabins from the book! I was looking for something that depicted simple dwellings, not necessary for a weekend or vacation home, but potentially for a year-round residence. Some of the cabins in the book fit the bill very well and the others give many options for every kind of taste, lifestyle goal, and toterance for "roughing it." The descriptions, photos, and details were delightful and informative. I received the book on Thursday and had it completely read by Saturday and am now going back to study!</span>

                    <span>If you are into the simple life and not looking for a huge, elaborate pretentious retreat, this book is for you. The cabins presented here are varied and there will surely be one here to fit even the most discriminating taste. Cozy, efficient, homey and attractively designed, there are approximately thirty designs contained in this book. <P>Can't you just picture yourself snuggled up inside a country cabin, set among the peace and tranquility of majestic pines abundant with wildlife, or nestled beside a gently flowing brook? The book is very well illustrated and is so intriguing the reader will not want to put it down until the final page has been read. There is something about "The Cabin" that reminds us of what is truly important in life and what is not. The designs are not overly showy or extravagant, but there is great variety ranging from rustic to modern. Whatever your preference, these cabins conjure up dreams of romantic nights, leisurely sun-drenched days and unforgettable memories. The book is definitely rated a five-star plus and highly recommended.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is a good survey of cabins in various locations that would fit most people's idea what a cabin is in terms of size, material and use. Included for each is a description of why the cabin was build and how it's used, floor plan(s), site plan (sometimes of limited value), interior and exterior photographs; as well as a general introduction to why cabins are considered by many to be the "classic American getaway." While I might argue about the inclusion of a few of the homes, overall it's one of the better books I've seen on cabins and why they occupy a special place in the minds of some of us. The quality of the photographs and the book in general is also very good (especially considering the price of the book). It is a book for the imagination or for those considering ideas and makes no attempt to be a construction 'how to' book however. I'd also recommend the books by Tedd Benson on timber framing (if you are at all considering a timber frame), the Jim Tolpin book on cottages, and the Donald Berg books on building in the country.</span>

                    <span>This book, like "The New Cottage Home", takes you on a tour of homes that reflect a particular lifestyle as much--if not more--than a particular home style. In the small homes featured here, that lifestyle is one of rustic retreat and recreation. For us cottage-folk, these little houses may be a bit coarse, but they are filled with great ideas for living simply and efficiently in a small and delightful space. The book lives up to Taunton's reputation for superb photography and extensive explanatory text.</span>

                    <span>It was a little disconcerting to see that the maximum-size threshold the authors set for the cabins covered in this book was actually a fair deal larger than the home I live in full-time now. But nevertheless, I was able to enjoy this look at intriguing and often innovative designs for getaway living. The color photos are frequently beautiful, and the authors also helpfully include layout designs for the cabins' interiors as well as illustrations of how the cabins fit onto the owners' land. The text tells the stories of the individual cabins and their owners, and also has useful insights on the process of planning and building these kinds of structures.<P>People who have, or plan to have, getaway retreats of their own will probably find much inspiration, as well as many good ideas, here. And even those of us who don't have a cabin of our own, now or in the foreseeable future, can always imagine ourselves in one of these great homes and locales (I dibs the one on page 160).</span>
