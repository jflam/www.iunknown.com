                <span id="Label1"><i>The Spanish Civil War</i> is a compelling account of one of the most hard-fought and bitter wars of the twentieth century: a war of atrocities and political genocide that was a military testing ground before the Second World War for the Russians, Italians, and Germans.<br><br>With his thorough and contemporary examination of the Spanish civil war, historian Antony Beevor unravels the complex events from the coup d'etat which started the war in July of 1936 to the final defeat of the Republicans in 1939. This highly readable account leaves out none of the familiar aspects, exploring them with a clear eye and providing important new insights into the war-its causes, course, and consequences.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good one volume history of the Spanish Civil War. Beevor begins with a nice precis of Spanish history leading up to the Spanish Civil War, covering both long term trends and a concise history of the specific events causing the War. The narrative of the war itself is excellent with a nice balance of broad description, discussion of specific events, and revealing anecdote. Beevor is careful to discuss the social and economic consequences of the war. There is very good analysis of the problems faced by the Republicans and their considerable internal struggles. This topic is ideologically charged but Beevor is evenhanded in his judgements, sparing neither the zealots of the right or the left. The description of the international aspects of the war and sources of aid for the combatants is enlightening. Most readers will know that the Nationalists received substantial and crucial aid from the Nazi and Italian Fascist governments but the Nationalists received also significant aid from a variety of other sources including British and American businesses, financial institutions, and even the Royal Navy. This book is written quite well. This book was written about 20 years ago and is published now because of the recent success of Beevor's book on Stalingrad. The Spanish Civil War is not dated and I believe that the quality of writing in superior to Beevor's Stalingrad book. For many years, the only one volume history generally available on this topic was Hugh Thomas' book with the same title. The Thomas book was a landmark and encyclopedic but rather dense. Beevor's is the best introduction to this important topic I have encountered. There are some deficiencies. The maps are adequate but could be improved. There is no map of Spain depicting the traditional regions, despite the fact that Beevor is referring constantly to the different regions. For readers unfamiliar with Spanish historical geography, this is a real defect. The bibliography is cursory, another real defect in an introductory work.</span>

                    <span>This book gives a highly informative account of the l936-39 civil war in Spain. If, like me, you find this particular episode of European history complex and vague, then Antony Beevor will be of great help. He takes care to first concisely set in place all information critical for understanding the impetus behind this conflict. Beevor explains that the rebelling Nationalist generals under Francisco Franco uniformly supported an authoritarian and centralized government that served the interests of landowners and industrialists. Arrayed against them was the Republican Spanish government supported by a variety of factions, often with conflicting ideologies, but usually possessing some motivation towards a libertarian and/or decentralized government that favored the working class.<P>While it is generally appreciated that Mussolini and Hitler greatly aided Franco and his fascist Nationalists, the book takes care to point out that Britain, the United States, and (although most reluctantly) France were all instrumental in orchestrating a fascist victory. The Spanish Republicans received significant support from only the Soviet Union. The reader can judge whether this 'support' helped or hurt the Republican cause.<P>The book also notes that Franco relied on a foreign legion of Moroccans as his most effective and ruthless troops (by all accounts, they were gruesomely fond of bayonet work). Coupled with overt aid in the form of armaments and soldiers from Italy and Germany, this suggests that the conflict was less of an internal struggle than might normally be implied by 'civil war'.<P>Beevor gives an unbiased treatment of the wartime propaganda efforts. These mainly consisted of one side charging the other with committing atrocities. Beevor's effort to sort the sensationalized from the reality appears sincere. Indeed, this coolheaded analysis is even more frightening in that it still produces a horribly high tally of executions and massacre. Franco's promise to, if necessary, "shoot half of Spain," was clearly a sentiment unique to neither side.<P>The book is excellently written and faults are few. However, the maps are inadequate, and placing events in their geographical context is difficult. Moreover, the initial chapters are chockfull of newly introduced parties and factions. Their names, leaders, and political allegiances soon became for me a jumbled mess. Beevor supplies a brief but descriptive appendix of these organizations, and it should be referred to regularly. In any case, after the first 50 pages or so the reading becomes smooth and seamless.<P>Those drawn to this book out of admiration for Beevor's Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege might be bit thrown by the difference in style, especially in the first few chapters. For me, Stalingrad read breezily, like an informative and engaging discussion, while The Spanish Civil War is more akin to a formal scholarly lecture. The author does however have an appreciation for wit, and his commentary is wry more often than dry.<P>The Spanish civil war is a fascinating topic in its own right. A greater comprehension is realized when one considers the degree to which it served as a proving ground for military equipment, tactics, and also the political ideologies that would soon conflict in truly global proportions during World War II. The Spanish Civil War impressively equips the reader to appreciate this important period of European history.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book for historical interest but also on the basis of what a good book Beevor's 'Stalingrad' was. While his study of the Spanish war is detailed yet broad and provides a great history in a modest-sized one volume, it just fails to be as gripping or even interesting as 'Stalingrad.' That could be due to the subject matter, but I don't think so because the Spanish conflict directly preceded WWII and many of the day's powers were substantially involved and had vested interests in the outcome. <BR>Rather, the canvas of this entire conflict is broader than what Beevor tackled in 'Stalingrad,' and perhaps he is better suited to a more narrow focus. There are so many competing political factions before and during the war, and competing interests from outside countries, that Beevor seems overwhelmed. Frequent confustion results where he makes too many presumptions on each and every name being remembered by the reader, etc.<BR>Still a fascinating purely for the amount of information contained in a rather short book. At least initially, the leftists in this conflict truly endear sympathy for their cause and are one of the few examples in the past century of a communist movement even somewhat capable of evoking sympathy. By the end, both sides mean nothing but heartache for the future of Spain, and certainly helped stir up the already rumbling war clouds elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>More political history than battlefield history, Anthony Beevor's recount of the Spanish Civil War is a complex look at the proxy war that took place in Spain just before the outbreak of the Second World War. A large portion of this book is devoted to the politics inside Spain both before and during the conflict, and the struggles within both "sides," as the political realities of the mid- to late thirties in Spain forced some incompatible ideologies together, eventually leading to the demise of the Republican government.<P>The best thing about this book is that Beevor finds a way to break down the political struggle along three axes of conflict. While he often bounces back and forth from the battlefield to the political arenas while presenting mountains of complex information, he always finds a common thread and manages to pull all the facts presented back into the theme presented in a given chapter.<P>Beevor's sympathies seem to lie with the Anarchists, though it seems that this is more a result of the fact that the Communists and the Fascists had foreign support from governments which history shows were less than benevolent. The Anarchist cause is typically portrayed in a more sypathetic light than the Communists and Fascists, whose aspirations were more totalitarian than the anarchists, who (at least as they are presented in this book) simply wanted the right to govern themselves. To his credit, however, he does not spare any party in the description of the murderous brutality between all participants. He takes extra time to explain the propaganda battle (a very important aspect of the conflict), from the atrocities committed against the Church to the efforts of both sides to win victories based on propaganda, rather than military, goals.<P>Some of the political conundrums of Spain in the '30s are also presented. One of the most interesting is the plight of the Anarchists. They had a massive party capable of wielding immense power, but since they rejected the idea of elections, they were reduced to being bystanders in the political world. The compromises they made once the war started, as a result of the aggressive nature of the Communists (backed by the Stalinist USSR), and the backlash against the Communists near the end of the conflict, are a couple of the major underlying themes of this book. Beevor expalins it best when he says that "The Nationalists defended a common view of the past; the Republican coalition in contrast, had widely differing visions of the future."<P>This is a very infomative book, and the reader will take a lot of understanding away from it. I would, however recommend two things, the first of which is to read and bookark the list of political parties and organizations on pages 285 through 287, before reading the rest of the book. The second is to take the time to write down the names of important individuals. This will significantly ease the reader's efforts to remember the mass of information presented. While this book is roughly 285 pages long, it is a very long 285 pages, as previous reviewers have noted, and is not an easy read.</span>

                    <span>The Spanish Civil War, by Anthony Beevor, is a fairly detailed survey of the history of this occasionally confusing period. Beevor spends a few chapters giving much needed historical background. The detail is necessary but a little dry and perhaps exhaustive to read as an introduction. The social and economic history of Spain is dealt with in enough detail to put the civil war in context. After covering the events leading up to the war, the bulk of the book is devoted to a very detailed, more or less chronological history of the war itself.<BR>The events leading the to defeat of the Spanish Republic are sometimes referred to as a civil war within a civil war. Much attention is paid to distinguishing the various factions and personalities on both sides of the war. The Carlists, the Falange, PUOM, the Communists, the anarchists, et al, are all dealt with in detail so the reader is never really confused about how their aims, and why they did what they did. Beevor also spends time discussing regional differences among various factions. Lots of attention is paid to how the Republican forces were consumed largely from within, and how the various Nationalist factions also suffered some degree of discord.. In the end, fractionalization of Republican forces, Soviet style purges, a Communist take-over and just plain bad military and political leadership led to their inevitable defeat. <BR>Beevor is dispassionate in his treatment of both sides. There's no real moralizing: I saw no obvious agenda. Instead, he gives detailed descriptions of the agendas, excesses and strengths and weaknesses of all sides and factions. <BR>Against all of this was the background of foreign intervention. Again, Beevor goes into detail about the German, Italian and Russian interventions, and the lessons learned (or not learned) by each. The book also covers the incredible failure of the European and American democracies to do anything stop the war, and the hypocrisy involved in all their policies vis-a-vis Spain and the treatment of the various factions.<BR>Overall, this book is an excellent history of the war. The detail is thorough enough to make some parts a little slow to read. All sides are covered in detail, with no evident political agenda. Events are covered in extreme detail and all the factions are thoroughly explained. I would not call this the 'definitive' history of the war, but this is an excellent, detailed overview and a must read for anybody interested in this period.</span>
