                <span id="Label1"><div>With an understanding of the .NET framework, stable and robust multithreaded applications can be developed with minimal effort. Covering the topics related to multithreaded development, this book not only focuses on how a task is performed but also on the more important question of why these tasks are performed. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach to multithreading are analyzed so that programmers and developers can choose the appropriate approach based on their particular constraints. Complete coverage of multithreading development using the .NET framework in both Visual Basic .NET and C# is provided in addition to detailed analyses of threads, delegates, asynchronous execution, threadpools, and locks.<br></div></span>

                    <span>This book is just plain bad. <P>The source code is awful. Not only is it poorly formatted, sometimes incorrect and in an annoying mix of C# and VB.NET, but the examples are often horribly incomplete. I usually read programming books by skimming the source and text at the same time but I can't do that in .NET Multithreading because many of the examples are just snippets and are lacking in important information such as types. I was often forced to either slog through the text or hit MSDN to figure out what was going on.<P>The other reviewers' comments on the lack of depth are right on the mark. You'll get enough information to write trivial little applications, but that's about it. To its credit, the book does do a decent job of warning you about multithreading problems, though I think it should do a better job of instilling a healthy sense of fear in threading newbies.<P>If you really want to understand multithreading, I'd recommend reading Tannenbaum's OS book for the basics, followed by the MSDN literature for .NET specifics. It also helps to read a book on Win32 multithreading so you can understand what's going on underneath the .NET layer. You should also read Debugging Applications for Microsoft .NET and Microsoft Windows.<P>I probably would not buy this book again.</span>

                    <span>The authors are obviously trying very hard to "delve" into the details of .NET multithreading, but their performance is really disappointing. My impression is that they have inadequate training in operating system essentials to go into the "threading" topic.<P>The other day I picked up "Multithreaded Programming with Java" published by Prentice Hall PTR, which gave a thorough treatment on the fundamentals of threading. The difference between a real industry expert and a wannabe is too obvious. So is the difference between an established, respectable publisher and a new player.</span>

                    <span>The book gives a good explanation on .NET Threading. The problem is that the code-examples are alternated between VB.Net and C# along the book. As a C# developer, I don't like to read code in VB.Net. It made things more complicated to me. I suggest the author to release two different editions, one for each language. Or use all the code syntax in C# (which is considered the "main" .NET language).</span>

                    <span>I bought this book to get a clear picture of what .NET has in terms of thread support. This book gives you that. It is reasonably well written, but the editors have failed badly because there are numerous typographical mistakes and inconsistencies between the text and the quoted code examples.<P>Alan succeeds in getting the ideas across, but unfortunately the examples that can be downloaded from the web site are tough to find because the directory structure of the downloaded code does not correctly match the sections in the text that it is supposed to match to.<P>I'd definitely still recommend getting the book. It should be mandatory reading for anyone switching to .NET programming, especially VB people who typically are not experienced with real enterprise application development.</span>

                    <span>I've been working with C# .NET and bought the book to see if it could shed some light on .NET threading. Unfortunately, the book lacks depth. The threading model in C# is a completely different model than Java. In java, threads are owned by parent thread or set as a daemon thread. In C#, the threading is client centric and designed for atomic processes. For example, the book doesn't cover examples where an application has persistent threads running as server processes to maximize object/thread reuse for stateful applications. Not all uses of threading is simplistic as the examples provided in the book. Overall, the book is a decent intro, but it's far from being thorough and complete. In server environments where you want a master thread to manage a pool of 20-100 threads, .NET simply isn't designed for it. The maximum threads in threadpool class is 25, which makes it totally inappropriate for many heavy-weight applications. For hard core programmers, the book is pretty useless and won't provide any insight.</span>
