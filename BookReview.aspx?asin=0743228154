                <span id="Label1">One would not anticipate a conventional memoir from Bob Dylan--indeed, one would not have foreseen an autobiography at all from the pen of the notoriously private legend. What <I>Chronicles: Volume 1</I> delivers is an odd but ultimately illuminating memoir that is as impulsive, eccentric, and inspired as Dylan's greatest music. <p>  Eschewing chronology and skipping over most of the "highlights" that his many biographers have assigned him, Dylan drifts and rambles through his tale, amplifying a series of major and minor epiphanies. If you're interested in a behind-the-scenes look at his encounters with the Beatles, look elsewhere. Dylan describes the sensation of hearing the group's "Do You Want to Know a Secret" on the radio, but devotes far more ink to a Louisiana shopkeeper named Sun Pie, who tells him, "I think all the good in the world might already been done" and sells him a World's Greatest Grandpa bumper sticker. Dylan certainly sticks to his own agenda--a newspaper article about journeymen heavyweights Jerry Quarry and Jimmy Ellis and soul singer Joe Tex's appearance on <I>The Tonight Show</I> inspire heartfelt musings, and yet the 1963 assassination of John Kennedy prompts nary a word from the era's greatest protest singer.<p>  For all the small revelations (it turns out he's been a big fan of Barry Goldwater, Mickey Rourke, and Ice-T), there are eye-opening disclosures, including his confession that a large portion of his recorded output was designed to alienate his audience and free him from the burden of being a "the voice of a generation." <p>  Off the beaten path as it is, <I>Chronicles</I> is nevertheless an astonishing achievement. As revelatory in its own way as Blonde on Blonde or Highway 61 Revisited, it provides ephemeral insights into the mind one of the most significant artistic voices of the 20th century while creating a completely new set of mysteries. <I>--Steven Stolder</I></span>

                    <span>...one of toil and blood."  How different the world was in 1962.  Mr. Dylan did not invent rock'n'roll hipness from talking too much, but from saying so little, and this impressionistic memoir is proof he's still not revealing much. Bobby Vee, Frank Sinatra Jr. and Tiny Tim are not necessarily the first characters Mr. Dylan's audience associate with the legend, which leads many disappointed readers to assume that this is an attempt to obscure rather than to clarify. But so what? At this late date Mr. Dylan has his biographers to set the story straight -- let's assume his own words still mean just what they say and that the created legend was a confusing mix of false starts and stops, confidence and insecurities, and extemporized recording sessions.
<br />
<br />Why not? No one creates their own legend out of whole cloth -- it depends on the willing suspension of belief in his audience, and it's helped along by a publicity department that values Mr. Dylan's own unwillingness to open his mouth about what the words mean. That's what the lyrics are for in the first place.
<br />
<br />Still, that doesn't mean that "Chronicles" isn't a put-on, a put-down or intentionally arcane.  "Bob Dylan" is still his own best  character. The book succeeds best in conveying the singer's own doubts about himself. Mr. Dylan's selective memory is certainly not a generation's collective one, and why should it be? The book reads like an overheard monologue, a man on the porch remembering bits and pieces of the past: this happened, oh yes, and then this. That's not to say that Mr. Dylan isn't a sly dissembler (he can be) or that the great stories are waiting in volume two (they're probably not). But it's akin to discovering one's hero still puts his pants on one leg at a time -- disappointing, but what does one expect? Ambrose Bierce defines the imagination as "a warehouse of facts, with poet and liar in joint ownership."   I'll bet Mr. Bierce never had anyone yell out "Judas!" after him, though.  </span>

                    <span>Insightful into the workings of the mind of a professional songwriter and stage performer. One of the most interesting, amusing and entertaining books I have ever read. It has been years since I have begun reading a book and realized that I was looking forward to the author's next book long before finishing the first. Mr. Dylan has a grasp of American English beyond that of most mortals. His observations of pre Civil War history will awaken one's interests in all things common to the American condition and spirit (pp. 83 through 86 - hardcover). The only fault found might be that Mr. Dylan's ideas flow too easily and too quickly to simply absorb in a single sitting.</span>

                    <span>Chronicles is a must have for Dylan fans and music lovers!  I read this book in two days and completely enjoyed it. I found it to be humorous, honest and inspirational.  A book you can relate to at times and lose yourself in.  A musician's life is obviously not all glamour and glitz and it takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there.  This book made me want to pick up a guitar and hit the road (and I am no musician).  Dylan conveys his life as an understandable, humble, interesting journey anyone can relate to, but an  extraordinary life nevertheless.  I look forward to new music and sequels to the first book.</span>

                    <span>As I read through Dylan's book I couldn't help but feel most of the book is relating his preferences for music and all the people he has met during his life. Dylan will devote pages to totally incidental things and then gloss over or omit a key event. Besides that, the book is intentionally not chronological for no apparent reason which really confuses all the forward looking phrases like "it was not that time yet."
<br />
<br />Overall I would say that the book speaks more to Dylan's taste in music than it does to his own humanity and in the end I don't feel I grasp his person much better than before I read the book.</span>

                    <span>Whether you're a musician, painter, or just have a passion for art, Bob Dylan's book will inspire.  Dylan provides us with many of the ideas, influences, and processes he combined to create great work.  Sometimes he describes his creative experience fully, though most of the time he paints only in broad strokes and lets the reader complete the portrait.  I couldn't sleep after reading this book; my mind was in a whirl.</span>
