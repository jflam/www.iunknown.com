                <span id="Label1"><I>Born Free</I> is a bona fide family classic. The tale of how Kenya game warden George Adamson and his wife Joy (on whose book the film is based, with Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers in the principal roles) adopted and raised three orphaned lion cubs, taking a particular shine to the one they call Elsa before helping her return to the wild, is familiar by now; so's John Barry's Oscar-winning title song. And while the movie has its flaws (it contains references to "Bwana George" and such that would be considered frightfully un-PC nowadays), the animal footage, especially that of the lions in their various stages of development, is extraordinary and timelessly entertaining. DVD bonus features are limited to theatrical trailers, but the digitally remastered film can be viewed in both widescreen and full screen. A keeper. <I>--Sam Graham</I></span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite movies. I first saw it as a child, and recently ordered the DVD version of the movie from Amazon.com. The movie brought back alot of memories, and I believe it has lost little impact from the time it was originally released in the mid-1960s. The story is a great one, the scsnerey in the movie is beautiful, and the acting is very good. The performance of the lioness in the film is spectacular.<P> What I find particularly pleasing, in comparison with the movies of today, is the absence of human-on-human violence, sex, car chases, explosions, special effects, etc. This movie stands alone on its own merit - the power of the storyline and the heartwarming, though sad, story of the lioness named Elsa. People of all ages and backgrounds who have a great appreciation for nature and life will definitely enjoy this movie.</span>

                    <span>I've probably seen this movie somewhere between 15 to 20 times since I was a kid. (I also read the book many moons ago.) It never ceases to entertain and is guaranteed to bring tears to your eyes by the time the song "Born Free" resounds at the end. Born Free is the wonderful true story of the raising of Elsa, the lioness, by Joy and George Adamson (sorry to correct another reviewer, but Virgina McKenna was the actress who played Joy Adamson, so it's not the story of Elsa and the McKenna's). The story is heart warming, can be seen by the whole family, & will make you want to book a trip to Kenya when it's all said and done. No question, this is one of my favorites of all time!</span>

                    <span>Joy Adamson wrote the book about how she and her game warden/husband lived in Africa and raised three lion cubs, especially the runt of the litter, Elsa. While the book was well-written, it was moving mainly because of the powerful sentiment portrayed and how well Ms. Adamson depicted life in Africa at the time. The film, with its highly moving and memorable musical score, captures all the best of the novel, without inventing/extrapolating the story out of recognition. The film-makers recognized what made the book good, and made that their own emphasis, creating a moving film that's a real tear-jerker without being sappy.</span>

                    <span>I bought a couple VHS copies of "Born Free" for myself and for my nephews last Christmas, thinking "that would be a nice, clean movie for kids to have", and I was not disappointed. You are instantly struck by the innocence of this movie. As another reviewer on this page wrote, I too cried more watching it as an adult and my husband and I remarked that we were really moved by it. Joy Adamson (played by Virginia McKenna) making her tearful speech about Elsa's right to be free struck us to the heart, that scene alone is enough to make this movie a classic. <P>Since seeing it again I have bought more as gifts for kids and for people who have grandkids. It is the favorite of our 17 month old, we always watch with him and skip the two very brief shooting scenes and the scene where Elsa kills the warthog, mind you these scenes are not graphic at all and they are very brief but he still put two and two together and cried. He was also upset by the cubs knocking over stuff and spilling the milk at first, but he quickly came to understand that that was okay. He loves this movie so much and begs all the time to see it. After seeing it the first time, we found him with his stuffed toys gathered around him "feeding" them from his bottle, like Joy and the lion cubs. <P>Due to the movie being made in the 60's, there is the one pitfall of the movie, the fact that the white characters have black African servants. The main black character is loved by all viewers of the movie, but still, the black employees are clearly in servitude and this jumps out at you; this element obviously has to be explained to kids but the movie is true to its time in history and of value to children despite this, and perhaps also because of this historical lesson. <P>Kids of all ages that we've seen watching this, (who have been raised on today's kids' movies that are so full of aggression, violence, sarcasm, etc,) were not at all bored by this innocent movie but instead were instantly captivated by it. All ages of viewers are so uplifted when Elsa gets to be free and be with her own kind. This movie is so uplifting, it's about freedom, the dignity of living creatures, compassion, responsibility, love, and hope. Beautiful scenery and animal footage, plus plenty of lighter moments and laughs. Adults get a little chuckle out of the very polite script, straight from the 1960's, though it is like a breath of fresh air, and of course there's the wonderful theme song which you will find yourself singing in the car and shower. Get out the popcorn and snuggle the whole family on the couch to watch this one.</span>

                    <span>I grew up reading Joy Adamson's trilogy about Elsa, the lioness ['Born Free', 'Living Free' and 'Forever Free'], and Elsa has remained always very dear to my heart, an unforgettable furry heroine. This film is an excellent and truthful adaption of Mrs. Adamson's wonderful book. In the late 1950's Kenyan Game Warden George Adamson and his wife Joy became the foster parents of three female lion cubs whose mother had been killed by mistake. They eventually decided to send two cubs away to a zoo and keep the smallest cub which had become the most dear to them. This was Elsa and she would acquire world fame. Much joy and heartbreak followed when the Adamsons ultimately decided to rehabilitate Elsa back into the wild. Since in their opinion that is where she belonged. After a difficult adjustment they were rewarded with success.<P>This film which was shot on location in Kenya and directed by Tom McGowan and James Hill is a remarkably intelligent and truthful adaption. It follows Elsa from cub hood to motherhood and superbly brings to life the joys and heartbreak which Elsa and the Adamsons went through together. Much of this is due to the excellent, dedicated and vibrant performances of Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna (who are real life husband and wife) as the Adamson couple. The Travers couple worked closely with George Adamson who was an advisor for this film in regard with the lions. Since they aimed at natural performances by the lions. Friendship would develop between the Travers and the Adamsons and they bonded firmly with the lions. After this film the Adamsons would continue with the rehabilitation of big cats back into the wild and the Travers besides acting went into wildlife conservation.<P>Since the heroine of this film is a furry one, something certainly needs to be said about the lionesses, lions and cubs who gave such wonderful and gripping performances here. The part of Elsa was taken by the lionesses Girl, Mara and Henrietta and the dedication and love of George Adamson and the Travers brought them to outstanding performances. <P>A film with many funny, comic, touching and sometimes heart wrenching moments and there's also the gorgeous Kenyan scenery to enjoy. It has rightly become a classic!</span>
