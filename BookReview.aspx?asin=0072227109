                    <span>This book should be retitled as MIDPand JDBC:The complete reference. It is in NO way a complete reference for J2ME.
<br />
<br />If you are looking a book on using the MIDP profile, this is as comprehensive as a book can get.It has complete code listings to explain each concept and has extensive coverage of the MIDP API's.
<br />
<br />J2ME also consists of CDC profile that is used to write J2ME applications for wireless devices that are NOT memory constrained. When one clainms that they are creating a complete reference for J2ME, they cannot leave out CDC. This book does not even devote 1 chapter to explain CDC which is such a crucial part of J2ME. Instead the author wastes space and piles on chapters by  explaining JDBC and web services. 
<br />
<br />Buy this book if you want to learn only MIDP, else this one is not for you.</span>

                    <span>Skip the first 50 pages, they have just about nothing to do with the rest of the book.  I want to know about J2ME, not about satallites orbiting the earth.
<br />There were several small errors throughout, source code missing things here and there.  But as I got deeper into the book I didn't know enough about the language to correct the errors.  That's what I purchased the book for.  
<br />Instead I went to Osborne's website where they have the source code for the book (with errors intact) but otherwise don't acknowledge that the book exists.  It would have been nice to have an "updates" section where a couple of the errors were corrected.  At least run the source code before you put it in the book.  I'm pretty disappointed.</span>

                    <span>The main problem with this book is that it is excessively wordy.  Every single example is introduced with several pages of text.  Every single time Keogh writes that any exceptions generated in the try block are caught by the catch block.  Yeah... thanks a lot for that great piece of advice.  After these several pages of text there is a box with about 10 to 20 steps that he suggests to accomplish the discussed task.  Invariably these begin with:<br>1. Declare references to classes<br>2. Create instances of classes and assign those instances to references<br>3. a whole bunch more oversimplied pieces of garbage<br>My point is that Keogh puts in so much extra junk into this book that it is difficult to read.  You generally have to read 5 pages to learn what one method does.  Any intermediate to experienced programmer (not necessarily in java or j2me) will quickly become frusturated and beginners will too after a hundred or so pages.  This book is nearly 800 pages long and could easily fit in 300 pages.<br>Another problem with this book is that the examples are overly contrived.  Also it would be useful if Keogh constructed a small box that would stand out from the text for each method that he describes.  This would discuss the parameters, return types, effects, and such.  However, he does not do this.  He discusses these types of things in several paragraphs of writing.  On a minor note Keogh's variables do not follow official sun naming conventions (which doesn't really matter but someone writing a textbook should try to use good habits).  That and his treatment of exceptions is generally very poor (always writes catch(Exception e) { // do something } which is poor because you in general want more specific information about the exception so it can be better handled).</span>
