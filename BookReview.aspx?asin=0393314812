                    <span>In reading this book for an assignment for a history class, I took to heart what the women went thru during the slavery days.  You got the feeling of being there with them and feeling their pain.  Ms. White has done an excellent job in bring out what really went on with women during slavery.</span>

                    <span>I believe that this book is factually incorrect. White makes a strong statement that slave children were dying of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SID). She is unable to admit the possibility, desire and need of slave mothers to commit infanticide. For a high schooler or entry level college student, this book could give the wrong messages. While some of her facts are well taken, the ones that she concentrates on the most may very well be false. There is other material in this book that I think is just outright wrong considering that I have done substantial research on slavery. A reader can learn more about chattel slavery by studying slavery outside the US: slavery in Latin America and Brazil particularly. Historians outside the US have not turned slavery into a happy patchwork quilt.</span>

                    <span>After reading the book I wasn't compelled to write  a review. However after reading. "This book demonstrates that white males and their Heterosexist patriarchy are mostly to blame for the maltreatment of Women  of Color in the south."- a line from an earlier review. I thought I  should say something.<p>Did you honestly get that from this  book?<p>according to this review "As we all come together to combat  the white male agenda of hatred, it is books such as this that bind us  together in our struggle to be heard."<p>Again what book were you  reading. I thought the writer gave an honest peek into the plight of black  women. And yes, while I do believe all of the women of the day (of slavery)  black and white were oppressed. this book rendered no absolution to the  many sins of our white counterparts. In other words we can either learn and  forgive or leave it alone all together.<p>because white women blaming white  men for the suffering and oppression of African American (slaves or  otherwise) is exactly the pot calling the kettle black.<p>The book should  have at least brought your attention to behave that is no longer tolerated,  as well as the conditions that still (unfortunately)exists, and perhaps  inspire you to make sure that you are an not perpetrator pointing a finger  at the more obvious suspect.</span>

                    <span>This book is a major disappointment. It begins with a story about Harriet Tubman and then leaves the reader to wonder what has happened.  The rest of the book is filled with anecdotes from various sources and refutes the  contention that this is one of the first books written about the role of  Black women during the slavery period..The book's weakest point comes when  she states that "both the black female slave and the planter's wife  were equally oppressed because they knew little of birth control"   this is feminist wishful thinking at its best..Another reviewer wrote that  "white males and their heterosexual patriarchy are to blame for the  maltreatment of slave women in the south"  I would urge her and  other's to read what many Southern women thought about their slaves.  It is  not the Pollyanna world of Sistahood between slaves and their white female  owner's that the author tries to portray..A cute book at best.......</span>
