                    <span>I have ready many Ebay books on the market. Many books cover the basics and a few more provide advanced tips and but this book beats all the others hands down!! This book is full of proven tips and ideas without any fluff. This is the one Ebay book I will keep next to my computer as THE MAIN reference tool. David Busch is a an Ebay Powerseller so his experience selling on Ebay has provided him with the experience to share practical knowledge of the subject. (Unlike many publications on the market written by so-called "experts")... Great job DAVID !...Kelly</span>

                    <span>This book is very useful. The best coverage for me:
<br />
<br />- ebay scams (in particular bid rigging - shilling)
<br />- interpretation of feedback (in particular assessing the likely risk to you).
<br />- auction timing
<br />- presenting information
<br />- legitimate use of multiple IDs
<br />
<br />The information on sourcing is more up for debate.  Some of the comments are overstated (e.g. bargains hard to find at yard sells). In general sellers are more knowledgeable, as they are on ebay.  However, many people selling through ebay or garage sells are doing so to rid themselves of items.  There are some people who run "weekly" sells that sacrifice volume for profit.  The author is spot on in his comments about dumpster diving though (if anything legal, health and security risks are understated in the current climate).
<br />
<br />Like the ebay hacks book, some of the information wont be new to most ebayer's.  It is mostly original and well worth reading.  It's not very technical in style and should be of benefit to new ebayers and old hands.  
<br />
<br />I learnt alot. This book should pay for itself, this is the best test, for me, of any eBay book.</span>

                    <span>eBay becomes more complex each day. 
<br />David Busch has put together useful information about this challenging oportunity. He bases it on his own experience.
<br />I bought the book and am glad I did. I would recommend purchasing several works on eBay to get a complete picture. This book is worth being one of them. It is easy reading and gives answers to many questions plus offering good ideas.
<br />There are so many misconceptions as to what is allowed, right or proper on eBay. David makes a good dent in correcting many misconceptions. 
<br />For example, his thoughts on the rating system are valuable. Also, useful is his observation that fighting over problems often ends up being a waste of time. Better to learn and go on.
<br />From his comments David seems to be a true modern entrepreneur; he is able to look at common things/ideas in new ways. Pretty good!</span>
