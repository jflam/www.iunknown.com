                    <span>This audiobook covers the principles of management. It also includes a storyline and is very witty. I was somewhat sceptical prior to listening, but I am satisfied. I have used it once and know I will listen to it many more times in the future. If you want to improve your management techniques in a new way without getting bored, then you need to get this audiobook. It gets very boring listening to the same ol same old management books with no humor. I hope too see more audio books produced like this to keep it fresh. <br>Good Luck and never stop learning.</span>

                    <span>being a rather unconventional person, when I was recently promoted into a supervisory position at work I decided that it was time to Learn About Management...not wanting to go about in the same manner as others would I decided that this book would be a good way to get an idea as to what I now needed to do...while it is a little surreal to read agbout Pooh discussing various aspects of management with a Stranger the material that is presented is highly useful and entertainingly presented...highly reccommended for the person who doesnt enjoy reading the same dry books day in and day out, or try to keep up to date on the most recent management fads.</span>

                    <span>I have read this book 3 times and passed it on to at least 4 different person in management positions.  I have found this book to be one of the best books on how to effectively manage at work, home and in school. I  teach a Study Skill class at a local State college and use this book in the  last third of the semester.  After my students have been introduced to  survival skills for beginning students, ie Time Management, How to read a  textbook, how to take notes, study for a test, etc.  Roger's book gently  shows students how to apply all the other parts of the course so that they  may be successful in their college career and beyond.  The students enjoy  learning, because the book is not dry and dull as so many management theory  books are.  They retain the information at a higher rate than when I was  using other books of this genre.   I recommend this book to all I meet and  speak with.  It is truly a library keeper.</span>
