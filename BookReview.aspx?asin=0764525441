                <span id="Label1">The bestselling guide that demystifies wine-now revised and updated   <p>   Winner of the <i>George Duboeuf Wine Book of the Year</i>   <p>   "Smart and totally readable." -<i>Newsday</i>   <p>   "Crammed with useful, accurate information." -<i>Wine Enthusiast</i>   <p>   "Complete...and agreeably relaxed." -<i>New York Times</i>   <p>   The nation's most popular wine primer is now even better. Wine experts Mary Ewing-Mulligan and Ed McCarthy have revised this friendly, unintimidating guide to cover all the latest developments in the wine world: which wine regions are now hot (and which are not), information on new rules for shipping wine and the new vogue for screw-caps, and, of course, updates on vintages, producers, and wine resources on the Web.   <p>   As always, the authors deliver just what ordinary mortals need to navigate the wine list at a restaurant or the wine aisle at a store, select a great bottle, and truly enjoy it. They provide an easy-to-understand overview of wine grapes and wine production, a detailed survey of wine regions and producers around the world, tips on tasting wine and pairing wine with food, pointers on wine storage units, and unbeatable guidance on how to choose a decent bottle at an affordable price.   <p>   Ed McCarthy (New York, NY) writes for the Wine Enthusiast. His wife, Mary Ewing-Mulligan (New York, NY), one of only fourteen certified Masters of Wine in America, is a wine columnist for the New York Daily News. Both also teach classes at New York's International Wine Center, where Mary is a co-owner and director. They are also the authors of For Dummies guides to red wine, white wine, champagne, French wine, and Italian wine.</span>

                    <span>I was always intimdated by the thought of ordering and buying wine. Wine for Dummies opened the door to a whole new world of experiences. This book helped me understand the different types, vintages, and tastes of wine. It gives clear information and explanations, and answers most any question you could have on the subject of wines. With this book as your guide, you will have no problem navigating a wine list in a restaurant, or the aisles of your local wine shop. There is information on pairing wine and food, how to serve wine, and how to store it. It is the most complete book on wine that I have read to date. <P>I found that it was easiest to concentrate on one section at a time, rather than to try to read and understand everything at once. Also, it was kind of fun reading one section, then trying some of the wines suggested by the authors, or simply trying the different kinds of wine in the section. The authors really know their wines.<P>This book will easily become the one you refer to most. It is concise, well-organized and easy to follow.</span>

                    <span>I have always enjoyed drinking wines, but I never knew how to combine them with food, distinguish a good wine from a bad one or how to read a label. I had read some books about this topic before, but none of them was good enough for my level. <P>This book answered all the questions I had. It is the first step that a beginner has to take in the fascinating world of wines, in order to enjoy more what they drink. <P>In a very easy to understand language, the authors explain everything you need to know about different types of wine, grapes, how to taste a wine, vintages, what a wine consists of and what we should take into account when we taste it. <BR>Then the reader is presented in details the most important wine regions of the world. It has very interesting tips and charts about wines that you should try at least once in your life.<P>The explanations are so clear and specific, that at the end of the book you will realise you have no more questions. Read each chapter attentively and try to remember every detail. Only after having done that, move on to the next chapter. So, you won't mix wine denominations, types of grapes and areas.<BR>The book is very entertaining and concise, by far one of the best manuals.<P>After having read that, I promise, you will no longer be afraid to order a wine in a restaurant or will know what bottle to buy in a wine store by simply reading its label. <P>Also, don't forget to practice what you read. Everytime you have a bottle of wine on your table, open the book and read. Next time you will remember easily that specific wine, the grapes it was made of and its taste.<P>The are only two things I regret about the book: it is not updated (the vintage charts end in 1996) and it does not have attached a video tape. It would have been more useful in order to understand better certain chapters.</span>

                    <span>When I was a kid and I got to go out for dinner with my folks, I remember my dad teaching me how to choose a wine. He showed me how to select a wine according to what we were having for dinner, demonstrated swirling and sniffing techniques, and discussed the local California wineries. It was great! <P>Then I grew up and forgot most of what he told me.<P>The good news is that this book contains everything my dad told me and more! But what I liked best about this book (besides the refresher course) was that it was written in an easy-to-follow, matter-of-fact manner. The tips were practical, the commentary was light-hearted, and at times I almost felt like I was reading instructions written especially for me by a friend.<P>A definite "must-have" for anyone who wants to add a bit of practical culture to his or her repertoire!</span>

                    <span>A lot of useful information, but the book has not been updated in a few years and all of the vintage charts end in 1996. A lot has happened in the world of wines since 1996. Try a book that is updated every year like "Windows on the World Complete Wine Course: 2003". I own both books and much prefer Windows on the World.</span>

                    <span>The second edition of "Wine for Dummies" (WfD) is an excellent value. In an hour or so, you can get up to speed quick enough not to be totally embarrassed at a wine shop. After reading the whole book, you will have a surprising amount of information at your disposal. There is good coverage of tips on wine tasting, selecting, collecting, etc. There is also very good coverage of the various types of wine and the major countries that make it available. Near the end is a FAQ of sorts which is helpful, as are the appendices. Very little wasteful information (i.e., fluff) and the information is very good stuff. Highly recommended.</span>
