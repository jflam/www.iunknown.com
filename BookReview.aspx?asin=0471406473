                    <span>I have an older edition of this book. It is well-written and has a good selection of homework problems, but it lacks clarity and does not emphasize practice. Most proof books are good for learning the basics of proofs but aren't sufficient to do proofs in a specific area of math. My website focuses on how to practice doing proofs, fsc729.ifreepages.com.

                    <span>I had one of my math courses at Macalester College use this book in addition to the main textbook. It is one of the most boring readings in math ever. If you want a beginning book that would teach you how to do problem-oriented math, you had better consider George Polya's How to Solve It or consult a math teacher near you;-) In order to further underscore my poit, I will just say that it was not only I but the whole class that disgruntled against the book and we hated it so much that the professor does not use it anymore.</span>

                    <span>Contrary to the review by the person from Louisiana I feel the second edition is better than the first. The typesetting is greatly improved, and there are a few new tools for your toolbag in the second edition.<p>As to the criticism that the second edition only has solutions for the odd numbered problems, the reviewer failed to mention that there are twice as many problems in the new edition and that all the problems from the first edition were carried into the second (along with their solutions). I found it more satisfying working through the second edition knowing that the problems were correctly solved - not because the answer matches the back of the book - but because the arguments are compelling and demonstrably correct.<p>I heartily recommend this book to anyone who feels mystified at the process of writing proofs.</span>

                    <span>When I order this book it was not at all clear if I would like it, because of it low grades contain and examples. I was very surprised when I received it, because the book is written very clearly. The author make a great job when he explains the technics of proof. The exercises and the examples are definitely too easy for an undergraduate or graduate but you must take a look at it just for the explanation that the author gives for the technics of proof. The examples and exercises are mostly for high school students. The price of the book make it very affordable. It worth the price. I would recommend this book to anyone who want to introduce himself into the basic of proofs.</span>
