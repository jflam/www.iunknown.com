                <span id="Label1">The surgeon-as-rock-star mystique seems like it must have come straight out of Hollywood, but the myth had to begin more concretely.  A good candidate is Minnesota's Dr. Walt Lillehei, the hard-working, hard-playing father of open-heart surgery, whose life is told in garish color in <I>King of Hearts</I> by journalist G. Wayne Miller.  From his early brilliance, recovery from deadly lymphatic cancer, and dramatic repair of seemingly hopeless heart cases to the disintegration of his career at its peak thanks to an army of personal enemies and conviction on tax evasion counts, his story is consistently surprising and engaging.	Fast cars, hard drinking, and plenty of women filled his time when he wasn't turning lives around with a few strokes of his scalpel, and the reader will find the surgeon's actions almost unbelievable--rarely endearing, but occasionally saintly.  Combining this melodramatic biography with the fascinating story of the struggle for open-heart surgery, considered impossible little more than a generation ago, Miller makes a compelling case that the daring scientist was simply another side of the arrogant, absent-minded playboy.  No ordinary biography, <I>King of Hearts</I> is breathless reading--you'll find yourself surfacing every few chapters to remind yourself its nonfiction. <I>--Rob Lightner</I> </span>

                    <span>As I read this book, I was profoundly moved. I was was born with a ASD  & pulmonary valve defect. Dr Richard Varco and Lellehei did my surgery At the Variety Club Heart hospital in 1955 . I was one of the 1st one hundred surgeries done at the U of Minn.What incredable dedication , hard work, these men had. In my early twenties, I again needed heart surgery. This time again a very brillent, dedicated surgeon by the name of U Scott Page did a total correction.I have been able to live a wonderful. active life thanks the The King of Heart and team and Dr Page.  I owe my life to the many, many dogs used to perfect progress of open heart surgery. I am a nurse, I have cared for many open heart patients. Thank you Dr Varco, Dr Lillehei and Dr S Page</span>

                    <span>This book is a must read for any parent with a child in need of open-heart surgery.  My son's defect was repaired at four months of age and this book was a major source of information for my husband and me prior to the surgery, as we sought to learn all we could about the heart and what open-heart surgery entails.  <p>Our pediatric cardiologist read it and loved it!  We also gave the book as a gift to our son's heart surgeon.  It is a thrilling book and helped us to understand the technicalities of our son's operation, along with giving us the perspective of what "standing on the shoulders of giants" truly means.</span>

                    <span>In Capote-esq style, up very close, through a small window focused on events in time, Mr. Miller has documented physicians/scientists struggle to understand and perfect open heart surgery detailing all the bodies and blood that were left in the wake of their effort.<p>Not only is King of Hearts educational and informative, it makes for a compelling read as the story unfolds with all the drama of a strategic battle: heros, heroic decisions, luck and cowardice.<p>This reader liked it.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Miller's style of suspense keeps us reading to see what happens next.    He vividly portrays the progress of open heart surgery, step by painful  and bloody step.  The reader suffers with the parents and doctors with each  failed operation on each child, but watching as each technical problem is  solved makes everything ok in the end.<p>The reader learns about various  congenital heart diseases of children, the symptoms, the physical  descriptions, and the outcomes.  Mr. Miller explains the procedures very  well so no prior knowledge of surgery, medicine, or heart physiology is  required.<p>My favorite part is the race with the Mayo Clinic to perfect  the heart-lung machine.  The Mayo Clinic not only loses, but loses almost  comically.  Another favorite part is how the pace-maker was invented.    This story along with the heart-lung machine story make this book worth  reading.<p>If you are interested in medicine, surgery, heart problems,  medical history, medical technology, or just want to learn, then you will  appreciate "King of Hearts."</span>
