                    <span>Unbelievable.<P>Ladies and gentlemen, I am writing this review on the eve of the release of the third and final installment of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, as adapted by Peter Jackson and New Line cinema. Fans such as I find it hard to accept that the nearly four year reign of the Rings trilogy is over. But it had to end sometime. Having just seen the movie, I simply have no choice but to share with you.<P>PLOT: Hobbit Frodo Baggins of the Shire, aided by his friend Sam and guide Gollum, continues his quest to destroy the Ring of power, the one that, if regained by the Dark Lord Sauron, gives the wearer the ultimate power to rule the world. The catch is that the Ring corrupts any bearer; it was created for evil, and evil does it serve. <BR>Meantime, the original members of the Fellowship unite with the rest of the leaders of the free world to resist the unstoppable surge of Sauron's deadly, crushing army, 200,00 strong. The brunt of this force falls upon the land of Gondor, the bigger of the two kingdoms of men. Gandalf the White must ride with Pippin to Gondor, where he must work against the complacent Steward of Gondor to prepare for the oncoming war. Aragorn must claim his true destiny, in order to take command over an army of hideous, un-dead troops, who broke a pledge to Aragorn's ancestor long ago, and were cursed until they fulfilled it. All must come together to fight the most enormous battle of the age, both ours and theirs. <P>BAD POINTS: Violence is the only complaint one can have. And violence abounds. One must expect it with the battles that take place, but one must also be warned, in case it might offend, or upset the younger generation. Orcs are killed in every imaginable way possible. Giant elephant-like enemy beasts stomp and gore troops to death. The very creepy Nazgûl pick up, crush, and throw troops. A man is shown splashing oil on himself and his son, with the intention of burning them both alive. One of them is set afire, and runs aflame and throws himself off of a high point. During battle, the heads of previously slain soldiers are hurled over the city walls by the orcs. A giant spider stings and then wraps Frodo up, before doing combat with Sam. Gollum's former identity Sméagol is shown strangling a fellow hobbit to death for the Ring. All this and more take place. I don't mind, because violence must take place if Right must triumph over Wrong. But you have the right to know.<P>GOOD POINTS: The special effects are ground-breaking, that much is obvious. But the incredible emotion, the power, the grandeur of it all is enough to make you cry, and I nearly did. My companions (appropriately dressed for the occasion: I as Aragorn, my brother as Gandalf, my sister as Éowyn) cried a lot. This movie is bound to storm the awards ceremonies, and top the box office for the next month in the least. <P>My friend, words do not do justice to how incredible and colossally amazing this film is. From the tear-jerking resolve of Sam, to the gritty, stern determination of Gandalf and Aragorn, this film is pure Tolkien magic through and through. I don't care if you are a Tolkien fan or not, you will enjoy this movie. I'd stake my reputation on it. <P>200 out of 10 stars, and that's severely undercutting it.</span>

                    <span>The third installment of perhaps the greatest film trilogy of all-time, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King draws the epic journey of the One Ring to highly-anticipated end. <BR>	Director Peter Jackson displays his finest work to date, as the film flawlessly weaves in and out of different sub-plots while balancing action with dialogue to perfection. Jackson also takes his boldest stab at adapting the LOTR series by straying away from the novel's plot and dialogue more than the other two books. Jackson even took the liberty of adding a different beginning and end to the film. <BR>	Viggo Mortensen stars as the Northern Ranger Aragorn, whose return to native Gondor is highlighted in the film's title. Although ROTK sets the stage for Mortensen's standout performance, he fails at times to be more eminent than the scenery. When he voices his climactic speech prior to the culminating battle of the movie, one becomes reminiscent of Mel Gibson's riveting performance in Braveheart. Unfortunately, Mortensen comes nowhere near to matching the Aussie star's electrifying deliverance. <BR>	One of the better performances of the film, however, comes from Sean Astin, who plays Frodo's companion, Samwise Gamgee. Like Mortensen, Astin's character receives a lot more focus in ROTK, but he comes off leaving a lasting impression on the audience. Astin convincingly embodies the courageous and caring attributes of Gamgee so well, that the audience is able to connect with his character the most. <BR>	While the acting had its ups and downs, the special effects were all around spectacular. The Battle of Pelennor Fields was a true visual achievement, as the armies of Rohan, Mordor, and the Dead clashed in one of the greatest battle sequences ever put on film. The special effects crew also did exceptional work in one particular scene, in which Aragorn summons the dead warriors of Gondor to fight for him. The phantasms of the cursed men were generated with such eerie detail that it intensified the atmosphere with haunting suspense. This suspense, however, was exceeded by the still uncertain fate of the ring. <BR> By the time of the film culminates, viewers are left with some sense of fulfillment, whether it be by viewing high intensity action sequences or finally knowing how the epic ends. Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King fittingly caps off the extraordinary saga that has drawn more attention to the classic novels than Tolkien himself would have ever imagined. If you take away all the publicity, all the awards, all the money; and all the recognition the LOTR films have attained, you're still left with an appropriate tribute to Tolkien's legacy.</span>

                    <span>The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that it's the last one. Oh yeah, and it isn't the extended version DVD. I had to buy this movie even though I knew a better version was coming out before Christmas; it's just too good to wait that long. Although I loved the movie, I did have one complaint: the whole Saruman plotline is wrapped up in a really odd way. (Peter Jackson promises that this will be rectified in the extended version.) The extras on this DVD aren't anything special, but I don't buy DVDs for the extras. If you loved the first two Lord of the Rings movies, you'll definitely love this one too!!</span>

                    <span>It is impossible to fairly credit the genius and masterpiece that this movie is in a few short words. Each movie in my opinion, has been better than the last, making for an epic third movie. <P>To begin with, the acting. People have said that the acting in each of the three movies has never been exceptionall, hence only one Oscar nomination to an actor/actress out of all three movies, (That was Ian McKellan FOTR.) However in this third installment there are several actors who must be recognized for their achievments, namely Sean Astin as Sam, and again Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Sam's incredible acting with his relationship with Frodo draws sympathy and emotion from me every time I see the movie. And Gandalf, with his several stirring speeches, both mostly to Pipin, are a a great acting performance worthy of recognition. Honorable mention must also go to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill, who plays Theoden extremely well.<P>Next a look at the visual aspect of the movie. In a sense of the natural beauty of the film, it is incredible. All three films incorporate a level of beauty and grandeur hard to find in many films. New Zealands fresh and exotic landscapes are always present throught the film, and can often take ones breath away. One scene in particular is that of the lighting of the beacons, as Peter Jackson takes the viewer on a spectacular ride over snowy mountains and sweeping valleys. The shot itself is not only a testiment to the amazing cinemetography and editing of the movie, but also the amazing beauty of New Zealand that is presented through the entire film. <BR>However as with the first two movies, The Return of the King's visual aspect relies not only on New Zelands beauty and Peter Jackson's camera moves, but also upon the amazing digital and visual effects that are integrated seamlessly throughout the movie. The Weta Digital visual effects team that brought to life such creatures as Gollem and Treebeard, have created the benchmark by which all visual effects will likely be judged from here on. Their ability to make a digital thing like Gollem who exists in a computer resonate emotion and feeling is a work of true genius. The visual effects shine not only in the obvious areas such as Gollum, but in the subtle effects that can barely be noticed; shadows formed by digital creatures that aren't there, lighting effects that create a mood in the scene that is otherwise non-existent. All of these things have been worked together so will with the real-time footage and acting, that you end up never knowing what is real and what is digital. <P>Everytime I watch the movie, I never am bored. Peter Jackson has made a perfect blend of drama, emotion, action, even some humor and romance, that the movie never grows old. Scenes such as Faramir's ride towards Osgiliath and death, the charge of the Rohiram upon Pelennor fields, the last battle in front of the Black gate, while Frodo and Sam struggle up Mount Doom, just to name a few, are beautifully done and are implanted in my mind forever.<P>The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which ended with this rousing finale, has created a pop culture phenomenon that will no doubt last for many years to come. If you haven't seen by all means must buy or rent this DVD. If you have, then I suggest the same thing, buy it. You won't be sorry you did.</span>
