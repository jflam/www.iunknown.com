                    <span>Absolutely great book on the greatest investor of all time. The author of the book has done a remarkable and extensive research of anything and everything that is Warren Buffett. From before his birth up until around 1995, the book is filled with details about Warren Buffet's life, personality, and investment strategy. Although there are countless books about his life, I think this one ranks as the best in terms of details and writing style; the book never fails to entertain and keeps you highly interested. Buy this book, it is a great addition to any collection, a story of an unparalleled phenomenon.</span>

                    <span>I've read a lot of books about Warren Buffett and this is by far my favorite.  If you have to read only one, read this one.</span>

                    <span>I found that I knew so little about Warren Buffett, and this gave me a wealth of knowledge.  Unfortunately, the book was written before the tech boom and subsequent collapse.  Therefore, you do not get a sense of what he did during that time of hysteria, but prior to that it gives an insight that most authors aren't capable of relaying.</span>

                    <span>This book helps you understand how one of the greatest business thinkers of all time got that way.  (How would Buffett approach a paper route as a boy, for example?)  If you are interested in getting inside his head, this book is a good way to start.</span>

                    <span>This is a superbly interesting look into the life of Mr. Buffett.  In my opinion, the most fascinating reading involves Warren's early years, as he learns to craft his genius and begin his life as an allocater of capital.<p>It's especially puzzling that despite being a nerd, Buffett easily charms many of his class mates and others with whom he interacts.  These skills were wildly successful as he went out seeking capital to launch his partnership.<p>I have read this book a few times, and recently took to underlining the most interesting anecdotes passages and Buffettisms.  After recently finishing the book, I realized that I had practically highlighted each sentence.  There are many gems within to be comptemplated<p>If you REALLY want to understand Buffett, ignore the "Invest Like Buffett" books out there (and there are a bunch).  It is a lot more worthwhile to learn about the man, and especially his principles.  This book in conjunction with his annual letters to his partners / shareholders is the best method by which a student can truly learn from the Oracle of Omaha.</span>
