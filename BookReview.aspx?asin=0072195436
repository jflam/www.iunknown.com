                    <span>I used this book for my exam (1z0-032). It is a good book, well-organized and detailed. It is far better than the sybex book that I used as supplement. The contents of the oraclepressbook are very closed to the Exam questions. The practice exams on the CD were very helpfull especially those questions related to recovery scenarios. I would recommend this book to candidates taking the OCP. But my advice would be to use the oracle online documentation to clear some doubts you might have or get more  information. Very often, the oracle online documentation provides you the best expalanation. This exam is really challenging with a lot things to know. You will probably have different recovery scenarios questions.I will also advise you to spend time on the Oracle Networking part to master the concepts correctly before taking the exam. 
<br />I will finish by thanking Rama Velpuri for the great job he did putting this Exam Guide together. Other than a bug in the software the guide deserves 4 stars from me.
<br />Thanks R. Velpuri

                    <span>Other than the typo's and minor errors, the book was a better than average aide to passing the associated exam.  For those topics it covered on the OCP exam, it provided sufficient depth.  However, there were certain nuances on the exam that weren't covered in any of the two books I used to prepare.  The tests on the cd-rom were a good tool to prepare.</span>

                    <span>I have just passed the exam using this book as the main reference. <p>On the 73 questions (63 were scored), the answers to 3-4 questions were not in the book.<p>I am not a network specialist but I found the first part of the book (Oracle Networking) unclear. I had to read quite a lot from other sources (books, Oracle online documentation) just to understand.<p>On the other hand, I found the Backup and Recovery part very clear. Just what you need to know to pass the exam.</span>
