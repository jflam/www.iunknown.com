                <span id="Label1">"The hour of capitalism's greatest triumph" writes Hernando de Soto, "is, in the eyes of four-fifths of humanity, its hour of crisis." In <I>The Mystery of Capital</I>, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up the question that, more than any other, is central to one of the most crucial problems the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail? <P> In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly informal, extralegal ownership to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is what also allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book revolutionizes our understanding of capital and points the way to a major transformation of the world economy.</span>

                    <span>Why Capitalism failed everywhere but succeeded in the West? This is a question that haunts many politicians and economists in 3rd world countries and in the West as well. Eventually the mystery became a quarrel between the two worlds, having the third claiming that Capitalism is just a hoax for the West to tap into their trifling fortunes, and the first claiming that 3rd world countries are failing to implement Capitalism efficiently.<P>The author of this book, Hernando De Soto, is siding with the second team in this dispute. And for that purpose he extends a very strong argument, which is that 3rd world countries failed to utilize the most basic element of Capitalism. And that would be Capital itself!<P>De Soto defines what he calls "Dead Capital" as property and real estate that is not fungible and can serve only in its most basic usage. Capital goes dead when the government fails to establish a real estate system that is accessible to the common public and is appropriate to the people and their property. What De Soto found after years of research and study is that in most developing and ex-communist countries the real estate systems are troublesome, drastically complicated, and out of touch with the real world. These systems nurtured a burgeoning extralegal style of living, where capital and businesses are not adherent to the legal systems of those countries. Instead, they work based on laws and regulations the people developed themselves among their social circles.<P>De Soto extends many shocking statistical information proving that 3rd world countries posses vast amounts of dead capital in their extralegal sectors. The author describes this capital as dead because property in extralegal sectors cannot serve as collateral for loans, are not fungible, and their transactions are not protected by the law. De Soto believes that the poor people living in extralegal sectors of 3rd world countries are the real entrepreneurs of their countries. They are very innovative in creating jobs and forming their own systems of protecting assets and their transactions. The author says that the biggest mistake of their governments is that they are trying to enforce the legal system on them when they should adopt their systems instead.<P>But how come the West never encountered this problem, you wonder. Wrong, the author tells you. The West did go through this and had to sort out many extralegal property and real estate into the legal system. But the West didn't enforce the law on extralegal property, instead they adopted the various extralegal systems and integrated them into the law. The author extends a thorough research in the U.S. history to explain in detail what created the problem of extralegal property and how the Americans overcame it.<P>One thing you'll notice if you read the book to that point is that the book is too long for its topic. And even though it's little less than 300 pages, but by page 150 I felt that the author had said everything he wanted to say. I believe that once an author begins to say "like I said in chapter x" numerous times he should stop immediately.<P>However this is a valuable book indeed and I learned a lot of lessons from it. De Soto is a man who will not make a claim without being able to back it with intensive and thorough research and study. His arguments are sound and make a great deal of sense.<P>If you're interested in the economies of 3rd world and ex-communist countries then I recommend buying this book. This book might fail to appeal you otherwise.</span>

                    <span>So often we hear the solution to poverty and inequality in the developing world can be solved by fancy trade agreements, or glitzy technical solutions such as providing high speed internet connections. Then Hernando De Soto comes along with the most unsexy solution imaginable: reform the system of property rights.<P>You (or at least I) would not expect a argument on local codes and regulations on property rights with respect to economic development to be easy reading, and I wouldn't recommend taking this to the beach. But it is surprisingly easy to read and De Soto provides a delicate and readable touch. De Soto gains a lot of credibility because he clearly has gotten his hands dirty in the very countries and issues he writes about.<P>To summarize his findings, in the developing world, property and business ownership is difficult for the middle and lower classes to achieve, and they live outside the "bell jar" of the privileged in the developing world, who do not face these difficulties. Failure to achieve legal property rights and ownership, these classes are greatly restricted in acquiring capital to improve their properties or grow their business. <P>This is not to say the poor and middle class are lawless in these countries. On the contrary, De Soto demonstrates that informal and customary systems of property rights exist outside the legal framework of the country. In fact, such conditions existed in the United States and Europe, and over time, laws in these countries were adapted to reflect and integrate these extralegal agreements. De Soto argues that this must also take place in the developing world for capitalism to truly thrive.<P>So it is not oppressive "First World" countries exploiting the "Third World", nor the lack of free market principles, that is holding the developing world back. De Soto is arguing for a strong central government to serve the will of all the people, if these countries are to be successful.<P>This unique, but very compelling argument by a top notch economist and good writer is highly recommended and really essential reading for anyone interested in economic development.</span>

                    <span>Many of the other reviewers have given excellent in depth summaries of DeSoto's book, and I will not regurgitate what others have already done a good job of saying. I will just say this: if you want to know why 3rd world countries are 3rd world countries, and what Gov'ts around the world can do to create prosperity for their people, read this book. Nations are poor because of ill-guarded private property rights. It's that simple. They aren't poor because of lack of socialism (quite the opposite), they aren't poor because of lack of resources, it's because "It's the property rights, stupid!"<P>Books like this can give hope to the pessimist, that it is possible to end serious poverty in the world. Relative poverty will always exist, but the civilization-destabilizing poverty that exists in the Arab world, in Latin America, *can* be cured if Gov'ts would just put in place a system that allows capital (ie entreprenuers) to grow from the natural resources within the country. Replace Socialism w/ Rule of Law. I hope every member of the Iraqi CPA has read this book and heeded its lessons...</span>

                    <span>Hernando de Soto's ideas cannot and should not be ignored. This book will open many eyes to the nature of capital. The author suggests a radically simple yet enormously challenging way of bringing the world's impoverished billions onto the track of capitalism and development: give them legal property rights to what they "own." The author's intriguing case is that a lack of property rights - not a lack of entrepreneurial zeal or competence - stymies development in the former East Bloc and Third World countries. This seemed to be a shockingly original notion when the author first propounded it in his bestseller The Other Patch, and it still does. If the book has a flaw, we warn, it is that the author's undisguised missionary ardor sometimes makes one wonder whether he is merely a zealot. Even if he were one, the book would merit reading.</span>

                    <span>Other reviewers have commented on De Soto's originality in relation to prevailing economic tradition. They have also praised his style - very clear prose, interspersed by passages of honest elegance. Yet, for me, at least, what stands out most about De Soto is his interest in discovery, in reawakening a long forgotten question. <P>Who asks oneself seriously what capital is today? Is one even generally capable of understanding the question of what capital is? I doubt it - the first reaction is ridicule. Of course one knows what capital is, for one lives in a capitalistic society. One can hardly take such a question seriously.<P>Yet, this provocative question moves this book. De Soto has carried out first-hand research among the boiling global centres of 'marginal' economic activity. He has not looked for the 'right' theoretical answer to the question of capital, rather, he has tried to discover a way to pose, and answer, the question meaningfully. Meaningfully for whom? To those who have forgotten - those in the West - and to those who wish to learn in the developing world and the former communist nations. What is capital?<P>Other reviewers have criticised De Soto for redundancy, repetition. These criticisms are off the mark. De Soto has discovered the conceptual solution to the question of the potential of capital: a legitimate system of representation of property. Yet, he can not simply elaborate it in a few words, for one does not still understand the question he is answering. Because it is disturbing and fleeting, it is very difficult to grasp. Thus it requires constant reformulation. Shakespeare used parallel structure, De Soto uses masterful analogies (I particularly like his profound observation on something so seemingly apparent as barking dogs). <P>De Soto also tries to situate his thought within diverse traditions of Western thought, combining Continental philosophy with American analytics (it is rare to see someone who is capable of synthesizing Derrida with Wittgenstein, to say nothing of Searle!). He seems to be trying to say the same thing in many different ways - yet it is very difficult to understand what that thing (capital) is. De Soto helps the reader by offering many different pathways to the thing (capital) itself.<P>I feel that De Soto might have engaged more deeply with Plato's thoughts on representation and his analysis of the cave parable is somewhat superficial. A more in-depth engagement might provide the basis for a rethinking of some of the precepts behind private property and capital, which De Soto simply accepts as given. This is a personal quibble only, however, as such speculation would reduce the clarity of the book, and thereby reduce its tremendous practical value for concrete action, obviously the author's main intent.<P>De Soto has written a masterpiece around a a simple kernal of truth. It seems so obvious in hindsight! Yet, it is the very stillness of those words in which it is expressed which will bring on a storm.</span>
