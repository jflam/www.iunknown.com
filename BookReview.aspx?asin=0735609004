                <span id="Label1"><I>Mastering Visual Basic 6.0 Development</I> introduces readers to the bread and butter of the Visual Basic programmer: database access programs. With lots of detailed prose and many laboratory exercises, this book helps illuminate the new VB6 ways of connecting users to data; combines excellent documentation of the VB6 development environment with solid explanations of certain features of the VB language itself; and gives particularly heavy attention to the mechanics of creating ActiveX controls (including data-bound ones) and to the relatively new ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) strategy for managing connections to data repositories. In fact, the book earns its keep with its clear explanations of these topics alone.<p> The explanatory material combines descriptive prose with precise procedures, screen shots, and lists of options. Some code listings are included too, mostly utility subroutines that readers can borrow. The real strength of <I>Microsoft Mastering: Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Development</I> lies in its liberal use of hands-on exercises (based on the contents of the companion CD-ROM) as a means of helping you understand the VB6 language and development environment. Though the exercises sometimes seem contrived (which, after all, they are), they'll familiarize you with various aspects of VB6. You'll know what to look for in reference books after working through the demonstrations presented here. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Data tools that ship with Visual Basic 6, Component Object Model (COM) modules, ActiveX controls, ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), and VB data-access programs on the Internet.</span>

                    <span>I picked up this book to brush up my VB 6 skills. Just brush up on them... I've been a VB & C++ programmer for over 7 years. After going through about 4 chapters I noticed that the authors couldn't decide on a level a detail in which to talk about their subject. They give you one topic in detail (several pages) then hit on a very closely related topic in 1/2 a page. Then you get to the exercises to practice and find that they are based on that 1/2 page of explaining a topic. And they tell you to "Please Refer to Micrsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Help" FAR too many times!!!! One thing for sure, you'll be an expert at using the Search Engine in MSDN!!! One thing I did like is the inclusion of multimedia files showing the "author" actually performing tasks... Just when you wonder what the heck they're talking about, you remember to look at the CD for a video. But even those are inconsistent. I say, use it if you know VB and need a refresher or are working with someone who knows VB. Otherwise. Microsoft has let me down AGAIN with this book. Look elsewhere.<BR>This book is more about how to use the automated Visual Studio capabilities than it is about teaching VB essentials. If you can't write your SQL by hand, then you should be using MS-Access. The Data Viewer & Environment is nice, but a waste...</span>

                    <span>I passed the exam by using this book in addition to other materials.<P>I thought that this book was very good in providing information on every topic. I especially loved building an application from beginning to end. But if you are purchasing it to pass the 70-176 exam, you will need additional material. For example, combining this with MSDN and Transcender is a pretty good combination. I also purchased New Riders MCSD Training Guide. It provided a lot of detail and was quite helpful as well.</span>
