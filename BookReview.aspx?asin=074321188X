                <span id="Label1"><P> The vastly increased level of competitive intensity faced by corporations and the increased costs of selling have radically changed the nature of the traditional selling process. Key or "strategic" accounts have now become a company's most important asset, in some cases supplying in excess of 80 percent of a firm's revenues. Here, in one powerful volume, key account management expert Noel Capon provides the most comprehensive treatment of key account management and planning yet published. <P> For the first time, Capon introduces his breakthrough four-part "congruence model" of key account management -- a new, thoroughly researched approach to optimally managing your key account portfolio. First, the author shows how to select and conceptualize the key account portfolio; second, how to organize and manage key accounts; third, how to recruit, select, train, retain, and reward key account managers; and fourth, how to formulate and execute strategy and issues of coordination and control. This congruence model serves as a backdrop as Capon takes the reader step-by-step through the vital functions of key account management including identifying key account criteria, considering the threats and opportunities for the key account, and understanding the roles and responsibilities of critical players. Capon backs up his points with extensive research, real-life stories of successes and failures at a variety of companies, and clarifying figures. Special chapters are devoted to partnering with key accounts and in-depth information on global key account management, an increasingly important weapon for staying ahead of the competition. <P> Timely, important, and essential, <I>Key Account Management and Planning</I> is the only reference handbook those with key account responsibilities will ever need.</span>

                    <span>As a manager in a large international consulting firm, I've been exposed to a number of different issues in a key account management. This is one of the most thorough reviews of the subject I've come across.<P>The book spends about 30 pages covering the introduction to what Key Account Management is, and more importantly what it is not. It provides a balanced view to the benefits to both the customer and supplier firm, as well as instances where key account management may not be appropriate.<P>The bulk of the book (Part 2 and 3) covers key account analysis and planning. It devotes two entire chapters to key account analysis and supplier firm analysis/competitor analysis. These are perhaps the most valuable chapters in the book. Chapter 7 covers formulating and capturing the key account strategy -- from the vision and mission statements through action plans and resource committments. Part 2 also provides significant coverage of the various organizational issues around organizing for key account management.<P>Part 4 covers critical issues in key account management, including issues in partnering with your key accounts and a whirlwind treatment of issues related to global account management.<P>The content of the book (though dry) is good for a survey of the issues. A number of examples are provided to illustrate points, though some of these examples are fairly weak and could have easily been omitted. The exercises and appendices provided take up nearly 70 pages. The exercises are extremely helpful at boiling down analysis, planning and information requirements for improving key account plans. The appendices provide exposition and further examples to back up the content.<P>Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone who is new to account management and looking for a very even-handed overview of the structure, processes and critical issues for account management. It was exactly what I expected. I would not recommend this book for someone who is looking for an introduction to a sales organization or for tecniques on selling as that's not where the book is focused.</span>

                    <span>Working in KAM and writing my thesis on Benchmarking KAM/KAS, I find this book to be one of the two cornerstones for me. It is well-developed and unlike many of the other books on the market, it leaves you with the impression that the process is difficult, but possible with proper planning. I have read many other books on the subject, that tell amusing anecdotes, make it look simple, and give little structure for proceeding. They are actually long sales brochures for the consultants that wrote the books. Capon's book covers how to manage the process of selecting, approaching, and acquiring key accounts, and more importantly, how to align this process with the strategy of the firm. Very useful.</span>

                    <span>For decades, companies have recognized the central value of getting close to their customers. Yet most attention to that topic has focused on selling to consumers. How to build such vital relationships with business customers has never been spelled out. Noel Capon's new book is far more than the best work on a long-ignored topic. Its breadth, depth, and practicality make Key Account Management and Planning a resource that should be valued by sales and marketing executives, their colleagues, and top executives for many years to come.</span>
