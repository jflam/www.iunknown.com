                <span id="Label1">Malcolm X's searing memoir belongs on the small shelf of great autobiographies. The reasons are many: the blistering honesty with which he recounts his transformation from a bitter, self-destructive petty criminal into an articulate political activist, the continued relevance of his militant analysis of white racism, and his emphasis on self-respect and self-help for African Americans. And there's the vividness with which he depicts black popular culture--try as he might to criticize those lindy hops at Boston's Roseland dance hall from the perspective of his Muslim faith, he can't help but make them sound pretty wonderful. These are but a few examples. <I>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</I> limns an archetypal journey from ignorance and despair to knowledge and spiritual awakening. When Malcolm tells coauthor Alex Haley, "People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book," he voices the central belief underpinning every attempt to set down a personal story as an example for others. Although many believe his ethic was directly opposed to Martin Luther King Jr.'s during the civil rights struggle of the '60s, the two were not so different. Malcolm may have displayed a most un-Christian distaste for loving his enemies, but he understood with King that love of God and love of self are the necessary first steps on the road to freedom. <I>--Wendy Smith</I> </span>

                    <span>The Autobiography of Malcolm X is a truly unforgettable book. This book describes Malcolm X's remarkable journey from a childhood marred by his father's murder at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan, to his racist school teachers refusing to acknowledge his academic potential, to a youth of crime and preference for white standards of beauty (both in his conk hair style and in females), to his prison days and rebirth, and finally his meteoric rise to one of America's most influential and controversial public figures. 
<br />
<br />Reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X has been one of the most important intellectual experiences in my life. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I vaguely remember when I was a teenager (1990, maybe) watching an episode of Charles S. Dutton's short-lived television show Roc in which his nephew had read The Autobiography of Malcolm X and wanted to become a Muslim. I recall the moral of this episode was something like: never allow another's passion for their religion to influence your choice to become a follower of that religion, as you should always join up for the right reasons, and that should always be borne out of your own self-awareness. Recently, when thinking about the point in my life when I first heard the name "Malcolm X," I thought about this episode. 
<br />
<br />But, no, wait. Surely I heard about Malcolm X back in Mrs. Buckner's fourth grade social studies class, during that week we studied the famous figures in black history. Was his image there, sandwiched in between the large, laminated flash cards of Sojourner Truth and George Washington Carver? Yes, I believe he was, now that I think about it. I still to this day take a lot from that week, associating Carver with peanut butter and Harriet Tubman with the Underground Railroad. The only thing I remember thinking about Malcolm X was where in the world a man would get a single letter as a last name.
<br />
<br />So, I was exposed to Malcolm X for the first time back in fourth grade. Being arguably the most volatile and interesting personality that we studied during that week, why do I not remember anything more about him?  Perhaps in 1984, public schools in Kentucky did not know how to handle Malcolm X. How do you explain to a group of young students (mostly white and overwhelmingly Christian) what Minister Malcolm stood for? Here was a man who was not a Christian, damned the government at every opportunity, and was betrayed and murdered in cold blood by his own race (albeit, with government assistance) in a bitter power-struggle. That is a can of worms that Mrs. Buckner, though courageous enough, knew she could not open back then. 
<br />
<br />But now is the time, I think, for Minister Malcolm to be exposed. 
<br />
<br />As a father and future teacher, I think Minister Malcolm's legacy is exactly what we should be teaching children, whether they be black, white, brown, yellow, or red, to borrow a familiar refrain from his speeches. Malcolm X has left something for everyone if we are courageous and open-minded enough to look.
<br />
<br />In his autobiography, written with then-journalist Alex Haley (who would soon after make history with another work, Roots, in 1976), Minister Malcolm narrated  his journey from Harlem's criminal underworld to his pilgrimage to Mecca, impressing us with the courage he displayed in search of human truth. His legacy for African-American literature is the record of his life, in the form of his autobiography. It is proof that anyone can dig themselves out of the deepest hole. 
<br />
<br />While the source-work for Minister Malcolm's life may not satisfy a historian's devout standard of authenticity, the question remains: What do we really want from Malcolm X? His legacy, whether real or feigned, is much more beneficial to the world than the small lesson one might take from preserving authentic history. The Malcolm X that we all know is the one that was courageous enough to develop his life's philosophy in full view of the public eye. He is the one that is portrayed in this day and age as a martyr, a perfect example of how a human being can evolve spiritually, emotionally, and philosophically from the deepest pits of self-destruction and debauchery. He is the one that, above all, illustrates redemption, whether it be with a secular, lower-cased "r" or a religious, capitalized "R."
<br />
<br />My journey through Minister Malcolm's autobiography has earned for me a great lesson in perseverance and courage. All people, especially young African-Americans languishing in crumbling neighborhoods with seemingly no way out, would serve themselves well to experience his life as written in the autobiography. There is nothing quite like this work in literature. It is metamorphosis, it is a quest. It is perhaps one of the most important works of any century, and will be at the top of the list in the literature of the African-American struggle for as long as the memory of that struggle endures.
<br />
<br />Back in fourth grade, as I said, I remember wondering where in the world a man would get a letter for a last name. Now I know how he got it and why. I promise that my son will not have to wait as long. The ability to shed falsehoods when we come upon truth, no matter how painful the transition, is the least of which we can teach the young. We are all wrong about something, at one time or another; and Minister Malcolm shows us that it's okay to be wrong, as long as we keep an open-mind. </span>

                    <span>I totally agree with the Time magazine's characterisation of this book as being in the top 10 most important non-fiction books in the 20th century. Certainly it is a great autobiography, and although I haven't read many others as it's not my preferred genre, I can hardly imagine another one being so poignant and sharp.
<br />
<br />People's knowledge of someone as controversial as Malcolm X will come from a whole range of different and patched sources. As a precursor to this book, I recommend the film (by Spike Lee), not because I think it's somehow "objective" but because it is based on this book (although it's very interesting to see the differences). Malcolm has been described as both a fanatic and a savior, as a racist/anti-Semite/hater and as a man who has dedicated his life to freeing his race. It's a humbling and rewarding exercise to leave your pre-conceptions about who and what he was behind and read about what he says on his life of street-hustling, drugs and crime, his prison conversion to Islam, his ministry, breaking away and the forming of his final beliefs and goals.
<br />
<br />Personally, by the end, I found him to be strangely compelling. In my opinion, a lot of what he says comes off as offensive to many because he words things so strongly. However, after penetrating his rhetoric, I got the picture of an amazing man who has come out of both apathy and black supremacy to emerge as one who truly cared about justice for all. I wonder what he would have accomplished with his new-found views had he not been killed.
<br />
<br />Most readers will disagree with a lot of things he says, or think that he exaggerates. Whether that's true or not, this book is an entire cross-section of 20th century African-American history and society that most people do not know much about. Furthermore, his ideas (in terms of things such as the loss of identity) can echo through to many other peoples and cultures. And it's amazing how many things he says are actually not that outrageous if you think about it!
<br />
<br />I tend to agree with those who think this should almost be required reading. Malcolm was an extremely intelligent, outspoken and passionate human being and no matter what you may think of his views, this book is THE 20th Century tome of mutual respect and the fight for justice.</span>

                    <span>Being a white upper class male, but more importantly being white, it was often difficult to get through the beginning of this book. Malcolms potent rage and resent toward the white man is extreme, and he helps the reader understand why. You'll read his honest thoughts and experiences of opression and racism. Being born with a physical disability I have seen my fair share of prejiduce and bias. I gained incredible strength from reading how a man named Deroit Red evolved from being a dope dealing street hustler into Malcolm X. It was especially rewarding to read about his personal transformation, and how his views changed over the coarse of his life. Malcolm changed the world through his refusal to be silent, and helped uplift and inspire millions. An important piece of history that every American should be required to read. The insight and courage you will gain is profound! A+++++++</span>

                    <span>This book should be required reading in high school.  Just a terrific story following the life of Malcom X.  You can also see the movie Spike Lee made that is based on Malcom X's life, but the book will give you a much fuller picture - it's hard to capture a whole life in 2 hours on the screen.
<br />
<br />The best part of this book is the progression that Malcom X shows - from being a hoodlum in NY to prison to the Nation of Islam and on to Mecca - it is not only a geographical sequence, but a tremendous personal growth sequence.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in American history.</span>
