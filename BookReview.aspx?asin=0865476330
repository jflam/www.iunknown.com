                <span id="Label1"><div>What is taste?  Is it individual or imposed on us from the outside?  Why are so many of us so intimidated when presented with the wine list at a restaurant?  In <i>The Accidental Connoisseur</i>, journalist Lawrence Osborne takes off on a personal voyage through a little-known world in pursuit of some answers.  Weaving together a fantastic cast of eccentrics and obsessives, industry magnates and small farmers, the author explores the way technological change, opinionated critics, consumer trends, wheelers and dealers, trade wars, and mass market tastes have made the elixir we drink today entirely different from the wine drunk by our grandparents.<br><br>In his search for wine that is a true expression of the place that produced it, Osborne takes the reader from the high-tech present to the primitive past.  From a lavish lunch with wine tsar Robert Mondavi to the cellars of Marquis Piero Antinori in Florence, from the tasting rooms of Chateau Lafite to the humble vineyards of northern Lazio, Osborne winds his way through Renaissance palaces, $27 million wineries, tin shacks and garages, opulent restaurants, world-famous chais and vineyards, renowned villages and obscure landscapes, as well as the great cities which are the temples of wine consumption: New York, San Francisco, Paris, Florence, and Rome. On the way, we will be shown the vast tapestry of this much-desired, little-understood drink: who produces it and why, who consumes it, who critiques it?   Enchanting, delightful, entertaining, and, above all, down to earth, this is a wine book like no other.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I just read a rave review of this book in the London Financial Times by Jancis Robinson, one of the world's preeminent wine critics. She called The Accidental Connoisseur "the most entertaining book ever written about wine." <BR>I must say, I agree. This is that rare thing - a book which doesn't describe wine so much as explore its place in our culture. Robinson points out that wine is arriving at a new place in our society and that this is virgin literary territory ( she should know, she knows the literature like no-one else alive - see her impressive book archive on Amazon ). Anyway, she says that Osborne has done something delightfully original here, combining a rich and "trenchant" prose with an open-minded, discursive attitude. Wine is place, and so an exploration of place is a great way to explore wine and the people who fashion it. It's something that wine writers almost never do.<P>In the end, wine is used as a metaphor for wider things, a conceit which the author never lays on us too emphatically. The question over what taste is is a profound one, but one that Osborne explores with the lightest of touches. It's a difficult thing to pull off, but I agree also with Victor Hazan's comment on the back cover, namely that it's a "marvelous book, period...a classic."</span>

                    <span>Wine is the pretext the author uses to question what really constitutes "taste." The narrator enters what is purported to be the pinnacle of the modern wine world to learn why their products carry such an exalted cache. He and the other common people he encounters have trouble identifying the tastes that the experts (i.e. judges of what is and is not tasteful) have reported. He can't even recollect the Lafite he sampled. What he does recall are the places and the settings of wines he enjoyed. Read the book to learn more about the winemakers and judges who try to dictate what you are suppossed to like, but come away from it with the knowledge that "taste" resides within the individual. I'll be re-reading this one in the next few weeks after the ideas brought up in it have had time to percolate through a bit.</span>

                    <span>The exceptional reviews "The Accidental Connoisseur" has gotten are easy to understand. This is not really a wine book : it's more like a protracted mulling over the nature of the tourist economy, on capilalist fetich and on the nature of place. Thorouhgly recommended for its intelligence and insights.</span>

                    <span>you already know everyone's in it for the money... this writer too.<P>The author meets men and visits places you and I will never ever have the opportunity to experience. He enjoys a privileged life in the wine world all the while complaining that it's just posturing... no kidding. I agree with the author but I didn't need to read his ramblings to do so. <BR> I don't need to read wine reviews to know whether I like a wine. You don't need to read this book to know that you have your own opinion.<BR> There are too many good books out there to waste your time (or money) on this one. Try a book from Kermit Lynch or Hugh Johnson. Or better yet enjoy a personal story from Bill Bryson or Peter Mayle.</span>

                    <span>I love this book because it recognizes that nothing is sacred. The self-important upper class and elite wine circles everywhere don't want to believe it, but this book shows how most of our ideas/decisions about wine are not actually based on your own reality, but rather on the reality of somebody who needs to make money off of your ignorance. I spent 3 months learning about wine at the Le Cordon Bleu Hospitality and Restaurant Management program, and I consider this book to be of greater importance than all of my previous wine studies combined. The section about Barolo is pathetic, I will admit that. Of all the producers Osborne could have visited, he goes to Brovia! How pathetic considering that Sandrone and Mascarello are available.</span>
