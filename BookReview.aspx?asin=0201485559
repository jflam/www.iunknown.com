                <span id="Label1">Three decades ago relational technology put the database field on a sound, scientific foundation for the first time. But the database industry--vendors, users, experts, and the trade press--has essentially flouted its principles, focusing instead on a "cookbook," product-specific approach, devoid of conceptual understanding. The consequences have been costly: DBMS products, databases, development tools, and applications not only don't always perform up to expectation or potential, but they can encourage the wrong questions and provide the wrong answers.  <P>Practical Issues in Database Management is an attempt to remedy this intractable and costly situation. Written for database designers, programmers, managers, and users, it addresses the core, commonly recurring issues and problems that practitioners--even the most experienced database professionals--seem to systematically misunderstand, namely:  <P>Unstructured data and complex data types Business rules and integrity enforcement Keys Duplicates Normalization and denormalization Entity subtypes and supertypes Data hierarchies and recursive queries Redundancy Quota queries Missing information</span>

                    <span>This may be the most practical database book I will ever read. While it is not wriiten for the complete novice, I would say it is important as a good second book to read (an excellent first book would be Access Database Design and Programming by Steven Roman, or Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes by Ben Forta), after you have developed a rudimentary understanding of SQL. After working with SQL in any DBMS, you will begin to run accross some of the problems he addresses in his book - inconsistent treatment of nulls, duplicate information, etc. Each chapter stands on its own, making it valuable as a reference guide, and in many instances he provides SQL workarounds for problems brought on by...SQL. Although he does lay blame at feet of current DBMS vendors for not fully implementing the relational model, he addresses the fundamental lack of knowledge on the part of practitioners. By far the best chapter is the one on normalization, particularly his discussion on the fourth and fifth normal forms.</span>

                    <span>Giving this book only 2 starts only because of its title. It is not what it claims to be.<p>This book title should be "Understanding Relational Databases, once again" (borrowed from 1st book by Fabian).<br>It is not for experienced database professionals by any means.<br>In case you have never heard of normalization or relational algebra this book will help you to avoid many mistakes with database design. <p>The relational principles are practical. No argument there. But in real world there are other issues like available RDBMS features, performance, deadlines. It is not a problem that this book does not address them as its scope is different. The problem that it mentions these issues as something having less importance comparing to relational theory guidelines.  Following this approach can ruin your design as surely as violating normalization principles.<br> <br>In case you have already had an understanding of relational theory this book is waste of money. <br>Samples are oversimplified. Try to implement supertype-subtype sample with the inheritance level about 5 and see how your design will perform. Many very useful designs are simply not mentioned. For example only "explosion" design is considered for tree implementation.</span>

                    <span>Ever wondered why is it so difficult to put rich data into the relational model, or why so much of database logic keeps being badly manipulated by application programs instead of by DBMS?  Ever felt SQL was too verbose, or complex, or illogical, and simply arbitrarily limited?  Mr Pascal helps us organise our grips against current DBMSs and hope for a better future.<p>This book analyses common database problems every professional with more than a few months in the field has already faced, and relentlessly trace them to failures in SQL implementations or in the SQL language itself.  A real mind-opener in the current state of the field, where from press to shop everything is dominated by vendors but few true critics survive.</span>

                    <span>No disrespect to this gentleman Fabian Pascal, he might be a nice guy, but he probably needed some quick cash badly enough that he put this book together by using C.J. Date's name and made some quick bucks. I purchased so many books from Amazon Books and never had to write a bad review about any book because almost all of the books I got were professionally written books. I just waisted good (money) plus shipping and handling on this book. I started to belive either the authors are writing these reviews themselves or paying people to write a good review about their books. I consider myself very computer literate but I had no idea what this guy was talking about and the book shows the tables and graphics as a pictorial diagrams like a young kid put together. Maybe I am being rude, but I do not want anybody else to waist their money on books like this one. If anybody does not believe me go ahead buy the book and see it for themselves. <p>I was thinking of buying C.J. Date's book "Introduction to Database Systems, Volume 1 (Addison-Wesley Publishing)" but now I am not really sure about that, because the book is ... dollars and this author took all his references from Date's books, and Mr. Date actually wrote a foreword about this guy.<p>I just read Mark Whitehorn's "Inside Relational Databases" book and it was excellent, but the book was too short did not get into advance topics. I was in search of something with same quality but in little more details and some more real life samples in them. But unfortunatelly crossed this horrible one on the quest for good database book. <p>I will appreciate anyone's honest recommendation about a good database book that explaines the RDBMS ins and outs without trying to sound like a genious wrote the book.<p>Jeff Unsal (Long Island - NY)</span>
