                    <span>Anyone who has ever fought to be understood about the extreme peace that is discovered in solo adventures will enjoy these short stories. Anyone who has ever pressed to have their own equipment and not rely upon the men in their life for their outdoor leadership needs will enjoy this collection of inspiring stories. After reading a few of these stories I was so moved to partake in a solo journey of my own. The night before I participated in a 32mile speed hike, I was seen thumbing through my favorite stories under a rainy sky in my tent. It was wonderful to see women experiencing these adventures of great self-importance. I encourage any woman looking for inspriration and female guidance to seek solace here!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading "Solo" and have been recommending it (and lending it) to friends. I loved these stories and didn't want to put the book down. Not only does each author describe their surroundings and actions (bicycling in New Zealand, kayaking in Alaska, trekking in Nepal) but they describe their emotions and where they are in their lives. Many of these women are making serious decisions about their lives, trying to break away from restrictive societal norms, develop a deeper relationship with themselves, choose between various life paths, and make decisions that are right for them (no matter how unconventional). I have been wanting to go on my own solo adventure, and this book has further encouraged me to go for it. I disagree with the previous reviewer's comment that "few tales show an appreciation of the outdoors for its own sake." Besides, is there only one way to appreciate nature and enjoy the outdoors?</span>

                    <span>Only a couple of the stories' authors showed the adventuring spirit that would drive them climb Everest simply because it's there-few tales show an appreciation of the outdoors for its own sake. Among the bulk of the authors, braving the wilds incorporates barricading oneself in one's hotel room, a remote trek through the Himalaya climaxes with an enlightening tantrum and adventure is measured by paranoia. The majority of these heroines confront more neuroses than wildlife.</span>
