                    <span>When i received Keri Smith's book in the mail i literally jumped for joy! I made a bowl of lentil soup and proceeded to devour "Living out Loud" while devouring my soup. Instantly i knew that Keri's book would become comfort food for my creative soul.<BR> <BR>In the tradition of Sark, who inspires us creatively, Living out Loud does the same only Keri's adorable coilbound book departs from Sark by supplying the reader with tear out postcards, cut-out shrines, stickers and juicy tear out Permission cards (this really appealed to the child in me!). For those of us who have the patience of a gnat, you will enjoy the brief topics that are beautifully illustrated. I have been an artist for over 30 years and feel that i have found a kindred spirit in Keri Smith and so will you!! <P>This book is sure to become my pocket Muse to be used again and again for inspiration and great project ideas. I highly recommend it!</span>

                    <span>This little book joins me each morning with tea and toast. It is brimming with great ideas, encouragement and wisdom that gets my creative engine turning over at the beginnning of each day. More human and optimistic than The Artist's Way, Living out Loud is a workbook, a playspace,a bible and a cheerleader that gets me excited to make more things in every part of my life. A rare gift.</span>

                    <span>After plowing through it in one sitting (glass of tea in my hand, perched in a comfortable chair) I ran out and bought this book for two like-minded creative friends of mine. It's wonderful, inspiring, beautifully designed and utterly soulful. I used Keri's suggestions to plan an entire Living Out Loud the other weekend when I needed to reignite my inner spark.</span>

                    <span>An adorable little hardbound binder style notebook that is full of inspiration. The book contains creative activities, words of encouragement and, of course, Keri's lovely illustrations. It's one of those books that I will read over and over. It's the perfect way to get out of the blahs.</span>
