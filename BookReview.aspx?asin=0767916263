                    <span>All right - I need help. There, I've said it and I'm glad. Stack has worked in a corporate venue and, more importantly, is an entrepreneur running her own business which is what appealed to me. I don't have a whole bunch of people sitting around waiting to make me productive. Especially if you work on your own, you're going to find this book useful. Mind you, some of it doesn't apply to me (how to manage kids, etc.) since I'm long past that phase. But virtually everything else is on target with how I limit my own productivity. Her advice is 'street smart' and crystal clear - all I have to do is follow it. No guarantees there!    </span>

                    <span>This book hooked me from the very start.  Laura Stack begins by posing the question "What's really important in your life?"  Not exactly a new concept, but her way of leading me to look at what truly matters in my life rang true as the logical beginning to setting priorities and organizing my life accordingly.  This book is a really interesting mix of information, ideas, and exercises.  This blend makes the book work on a number of different levels, and I suspect that after all of the other books on time management and organization get put on the shelves, this is the one that most readers will refer back to once or twice a year to keep them on track.  For me, this book was a good blend of motivation and practical information.  A good resource that I wholeheartedly recommend.</span>

                    <span>You have to be carefull with these National Speakers Asso. folks who write their speech into a book. The author says in the book that she heard Zig Ziglar when she was 14, skipped her Senior year of high school, took some business courses in college and went out on the speech circut. Her lack of real world work experience shows in the book. Many many topics with nothing covered in depth. No advice on dealing with conflicting priorities - just the suggestion that you not let your priorities conflict. Lots of her advice has nothing to do with productivity like "you should dress professionally" and when it does it is pretty simplistic like "say no from the heart." I was looking for a corporate veteran who would share proven techniques to get the right things done and get home earlier - I did not find it in this book.</span>

                    <span>Being "organized to a fault" myself, I really wasn't expecting to find much new here.  But I was very pleasantly surprised--particularly in the breadth of the topics covered--everything from how to get your kids off in the morning with all their "stuff" in hand to tips on Microsoft shortcuts.  I marked quite a few new tips with Post-Its to share with my assistant to improve our team productivity.  Great layout--easy to read.  It's a pick-up, put-down type of book as you have a few minutes here and there to read. </span>

                    <span>If you work 50-75 hours a week, this book is a must-have!  It teaches you to be more productive during the day, get your work done in less time, and get home to your life sooner. This is the most complete guidebook on personal productivity I have ever read.  It's not just about time management or getting organized or life balance...it's a complete picture of all the things you need to do to improve output, lower stress, and save time at work and home. <p>Using the word "PRODUCTIVE" itself as a foundation, Stack devotes a chapter to each of the ten key productivity factors: Preparation, Reduction, Order, Discipline, Unease, Concentration, Time Mastery, Information, Vitality, and Equilibrium.  Readers determine their own Productivity Quotient (PQ) Â™ by answering ten questions per factor, resulting in a cumulative score out of 500 possible points.  <p>I really like the way the book is organized.  It's not designed to be read from beginning to end: Stack has used a great hyperlink concept that allows you to "jump" right to the chapter and section where you most need help and begin working on those skills.  This modular format is really helping me improve my personal productivity, one habit at a time!  <p>Stack is also collecting the results of the Productivity Quotient (PQ) on her website, so you can compare your performance to others in your industry, income, gender, job function, and age.  Cool!  You can also register for a FREE monthly follow-up email, which provides support and coaching on productivity concepts.  You can sign up on her website at www.TheProductivityPro.com. <p>If you know someone who works too many hours or needs to improve performance, this will be a great gift...and a must-have addition to your personal library.</span>
