                    <span>In this day of self-help mania, it's hard to know where to start. Everywhere you turn there's another book being released by a motivational speaker. It's time to get back to basics, and the best way to do that is to go to the father of self-help himself - Dale Carnegie. This compilation of the best of his classics could be re-titled "Dale Carnegie's Greatest Hits." It is packed with anecdotes of how famous and not-so-famous people through the ages have hit tough situations in life and overcome them. Although some of the language is dated - Carnegie wrote much the material in the 1930's - the situations he portrays are not limited to any era. You will be encouraged to know that you, too, can be happy, popular and organized. We recommend this book to anyone who works with people in any capacity; it could drastically change how you approach your life and the people around you.</span>

                    <span>I always was a good man, after reading this book I became a better man, and I shall be eternally grateful to Dale Carnegie for his great work on this book. This book is a life changer, and also one of the best examples that we never know enough and that we should keep learning something new in each day of our lives. <p>It mentions the originality and how important it is to be ourselves rather than trying to be someone which we aren't and can't be. It covers our 'boredom' we get at work and it shows us the way how to turn it into a happiness.So easy that is, If I only knew that before.<p>And this book of course it is extremely rich by powerful sayings<br>and true life stories from people of all ages.<p>YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK and after you do YOU'LL WELCOME DAILY<br>PROBLEMS with all your heart because you'll know by then, how to <br>make them dissapear - within seconds.</span>

                    <span>My copy of this book is yellowed, tattered and over 30 years old.  Nonetheless, I can open to any page and find a bit of timeless wisdom and truth.  I've worked in difficult situations with groups and individuals for the past ten years.  I've worked with, convicts, hardcore addicts and the mentally ill.  I've also worked with highly educated, wealthy, distinguished individuals.  I'm here to tell you that the techniques in this book will work with all people.<p>No one likes to be criticized or condemned.  We all want to save face and feel important.  This book teaches you the power of humility and the art of getting what you want while working cooperatively and harmoniously with others.<p>If you find yourself struggling at your current job or if you're in conflict with your co-workers or employees, I'd recommend trying some of the techniques and principles outlined in this book.</span>

                    <span>The first time I read this book I was 19 years old, now I'm 24.  I have found Dale Carnegie to be on the finest writers that exist.  I have and still am using his techniques.  His book has given me a better image on  life and how to handle situations (personal and work).</span>

                    <span>I believe that it was really good book for everybody regardless ages and titles as long as it is working person.<p>Sometimes, we spends much more time in company together with collleagues. Therefore, we should set up our  own principals or guides to enjoy our life and job.<p>The suggestions and  guides he proposed are very relevant and helpful for that purpose  eventhough he suggested them many years ago since true principal could not  be suject to time and eternally applicable.</span>
