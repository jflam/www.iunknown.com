                    <span>While not in sales-ever, I have made more than 10,000 business presentations to groups outside the organization. The group size ranged from a few to many people. I have attended even more presentations than I have given. Overall, this is the best book on business presentations that I have read thus far and it is likely to be one of the best books on the subject when I have read even more books on the subject. Treatment of team presentations and video conferencing was very good. The discussion of hand outs to the audience is excellent. The review of all types of visual aids is very good. The author does a superb job reviewing the use of slides that is so overdone. Admonishment to keep jargon to a minimum is very correct.<p>Using stories and anecdotes is handled comprehensively. Humor is hard to use in a business environment. When you are sure it is going to work it is very effective, it is risky as the author discusses.  The work on delivery techniques and gestures is good. The brief discussion on stage fright is O.K. The idea of ending stage fright forever is unrealistic. Always be aiming for the that big opportunity that will bring the butterflies right back. The tools to beat nerves need to be in constant development. No author has done a great job on the subject. The most important technique is to become a leading expert on your subject and yet this is rarely mentioned.<p>This book has substance, is nicely organized and well written. The author exudes credibility with humility. Compared to the more than two dozen books on speaking read in recent months, this is one of the best. The areas that I wish I would have gotten help on earlier are using emotional appeals and personal stories for a highly sophisticated audience.</span>
