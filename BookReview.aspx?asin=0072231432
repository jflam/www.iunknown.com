                    <span>Colin does it yet again... Although this book at first glance appears targeted at beginners to the software, Colin steps things up a few notches by delivering sound information and quality techniques that intermediate and even advanced users of Photoshop will find useful and informative. Colin is not only an exceptional teacher of all things 'graphic', but check out his forum and website at www.photoshopcafe.com and you will find he is a heck of a nice guy to boot. 4000+ members to his forum alone can't be wrong!</span>

                    <span>I am a kind of collector of Photoshop books, from beginner's level to advanced. I found this book one of the best Photoshop books ever-made, also because the author has succeeded in explaining in simple and clear way advanced topics such as for example channels (p.136) and layer blending modes (p.126). The book (contrarily to many other Photoshop books) is full in color, and I recommend it for beginners and even for advanced users (thanks to the bonus section at the end " Behind the Scenes - a gallery with techniques from the pros"). Suggestion for the next edition: please made the photos showed in the book available on a Web site or on an attached CD !</span>

                    <span>Colin has a well established presence in the gurus of Photoshop league. The book is nothing short of what you would expect. It is well layed out, with easy to follow instructions and helpful screen shots in color, to guide reader. I recommend it for beginner to advanced level users of Photoshop CS.</span>

                    <span>The below review was written by someone who clearly does not value good advice.<P>I learned abotu so many features in photoshop, that I would have probably never ever explored! Really gives you insight to things you never thought neccesary.<P>You don't need images to have this book teach you, the instruction is perfect as is.</span>
