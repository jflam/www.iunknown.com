                <span id="Label1">Nick Kelsh, king of the kid photographers, tops the success of How to Photograph Your Baby with a brand new book full of tips and techniques that will help anyone take better pictures of bigger people&#151;children, siblings, parents, and grandparents. Produced in the same accessible, easy-to-follow style as its predecessor, How to Photograph Your Family contains nine fold-out lessons. Each one offers sensible instructions on how to take pictures like a pro. Quick tips, do&#146;s and don&#146;ts, and photo examples illustrate the application of the techniques. Follow Kelsh&#146;s friendly advice, and you&#146;ll create the family album of your dreams. Topics include shooting formals and candids; posing the family for a group portrait; capturing action, special events, and individual achievements; and photographing a range of ages. Best of all, Kelsh gives great suggestions for when to take pictures, stressing the importance of those everyday moments that may magically transform into special memories. Think of your daughter dressing her favorite doll or your son&#146;s first day on the job; Mom tending her beloved flower beds or Dad tooling away with his fishing tackle. Years from now, these are the images that will prompt sentimental smiles and thoughtful pauses.</span>

                    <span>I really like this book. After I bought it, I became a first-time father (of twin girls). I take lots of pictures with a good digital camera. This book's lessons are very useful.<P>What I value about this book is its practical, insightful suggestions (and examples) for what kinds of activities one ought to be shooting (e.g., shoot candids, not just posed shots), and how photos ought to be composed (e.g., shoot tight-in on the subject, not overly wide shots). The book has been very helpful for me.</span>

                    <span>In the pleasurable 1/2 hour or so it takes you to read this book, you can take dramatically better pictures of the folks in your life with the simple automatic camera you already own.<P>This easy-to-read how-to is full of practical advice ANY photographer can follow, with no technical terms to decipher.<P>Many of the tips seem so simple that they had me wondering, "How how come I didn't think of that?". <P>If you're looking for a book that will advise you on f-stops and apertures, this is not the book for you. If simple techniques like having your subject sit facing a sunlit window and shooting more film so you're sure to have a great picture are more your speed, buy this book!</span>

                    <span>I've taken pictures as an amature for over 30 years, but my people-pictures have never been successful--all the family photographs on our shelves were taken by others. In the first chapter, the author explained what I was doing wrong in simple, non-technical terms. Sounded good, so I took my digital camera, sought out my youngest child and shot several pictures. My wife and son were so delighted with the result they decided have an 8-1/2 x 11 print of one shot framed on his wall! <P>The skill-level required to use the book is probably "you can read" The ONLY technical term the author uses in the book is in the sentence in the introduction in which he says he won't use any. <P>The book is relatively short: I probably took about two hours total to read it, and I'm a fairly slow reader. There are, however, a large number of photos brilliantly illustrating the author's ideas, and the tips are so good that the book was well-worth the price. After a few months I will probably have reached the limits of the data in the book and will want to read something more in-depth, but I never would have gotten there without this great jump-start.<P>Not one of the most profound books I've ever read, but for darn sure one of the most effective.</span>

                    <span>This book has some wonderful ideas. However, it is pricey for the amount of information you receive. More detail would have been very useful. I bought 2 of his books - families and babies. One would have done.</span>

                    <span>this book is the best photo book I've read yet because the author explains it in simple and easy terms that anybody can understand. I appreciate how Mr. Kelsh tells you what NOT to do. I wish I had seen this book at the beginning of my photo journey, I would have saved tons of time and money.
