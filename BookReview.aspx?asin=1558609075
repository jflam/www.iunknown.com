                <span id="Label1"><i>"The book addresses a sorely missing set of considerations in the real world... This is a very timely book."</i><br><b>-Peter Herzum,</b> author of Business Component Factory and CEO of Herzum Software<br><br>XML is a tremendous enabler for platform agnostic data and metadata exchanges. However, there are no clear processes and techniques specifically focused on the engineering of XML structures to support reuse and integration simplicity, which are of particular importance in the age of application integration and Web services. This book describes the challenges of using XML in a manner that promotes simplification of integration, and a high degree of schema reuse. It also describes the syntactical capabilities of XML and XML Schemas, and the similarities (and in some cases limitations) of XML DTDs. This book presents combinations of architectural and design approaches to using XML as well as numerous syntactical and working examples.<br><br>* Designed to be read three different ways: skim the margin notes for quick information, or use tables in the appendix to locate sections relevant the to a particular issue, or read cover-to-cover for the in-depth treatment. <br>* Contains numerous tables that describe datatypes supported by the most common DBMSs and map to XML Schema supported data types.<br>* Unique focus on the value added role and processes of the data architect as they apply to enterprise use of XML.</span>

                    <span>In the evolving world of technology, and the 'do more with less' mentality, this book has helped me tremendously in expanding my Data Administration responsibilities in a major financial institution. This book is easy to follow, provides great guidelines and techniques for incorporating and expanding metadata into this new technology, XML.  I would recommend this book to any Data Administrator whose company is embarking, or expanding, their web presence, and is concerned about maintaining the quality of the data.</span>

The author's approach and recommendations on reusable data structures outline the path to enabling structural consistency and standards conformity. I work in Data Architecture and this book supports the viable dependency XML and Data Architecture have on one another.

                    <span>In a nutshell, this book is all about understanding XML schemas. As the use of XML transactions to exchange, share, and move data among enterprise systems grows, enforcing data standards and structural efficiency plays a critical role for ensuring overall flexibility, robustness and extensibility.<p>The author starts the book with a discussion about various XML application scenarios and attempts to classify the use of XML data containers into three forms viz., a document, transaction or a message. He argues that any form of cross platform exchange and sharing of enterprise data falls in to one of the three.<p>He then convinces how the use of highly reusable structures and custom data types affects data architecture. If you are wondering, data architecture is a term used to describe XML structures that plumb disparate enterprise systems. Here are two new buzzwords - Application to Consumer (A2C) and Application to application (A2A). Since XML also used to describe data extracts from, insertions into, and exchanges between application systems and databases, it is important to understand variation in database data type support.<p>In the chapters that follow, XML schema is introduced as the singular standard for achieving maximum reusability and enforcing data standards. For each of the three XML usages, he quotes XML snippets and critiques on various approaches. The focus remains on a designing an XML schema for maximum reuse and extensibility.<p>The book should have been named as "XML Schema primer". Most of the chapters are dedicated to discuss application of XML schemas. The amount of material covering actual process, challenges and strategy recommendations to achieve optimal data architecture does not do any justice to the title. <p>Ajith Kallambella [...]</span>
