                <span id="Label1"><i>Learning Wireless Java</i> is for Java developers who want to quickly come up to speed and create applications for the Micro Edition audience using the Connected, Limited Device Configuration and the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP). The CLDC contains APIs for small devices that are constrained by both memory and processing power. MIDP builds on the CLDC and contains APIs specifically for devices such as mobile phones and pagers, allowing programmers to create MIDlet applications. This book offers a solid introduction to J2ME and MIDP, including the javax.microedition classes, as well as classes surrounding the features of the various platforms that the J2ME supports (e.g., networking with cellphones, larger screen sizes and colors with PDAs, etc.)</span>

                    <span>This book is an excellent introduction to J2ME for experienced Java developers.  The book does what it intends to do very well, but the topic coverage is less than complete because it limits itself to the CLDC configuration and the MIDP profile.  Granted, this is the most popular branch of development for J2ME, but there is more to J2ME than the MIDP profile.  Within this limitation, it does a good job of providing a basic, clear, and working understanding of the Java classes involved with MIDP programming.  Intermediate and advanced J2ME programmers should look elsewhere for help as this book is aimed squarely at J2ME beginners.<br>The organization of the book follows standard conventions for Java books, starting with basic functionality, then GUI classes, then event handling.  There is an API reference at the end of the book, which usually indicates the author is trying to pad the book, but I think it is appropriate here.  It only adds 60 pages to the book, and it made it easier to read the material when I was away from a computer.  Unfortunately, the book was only 169 pages without it, and I felt that it should have addressed some areas more in depth.<br>A good book for someone looking to learn J2ME and a handy quick reference, but as you advance, you'll outgrow this one.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent.  Great for a beginner.  All the code makes sense.  Easy to read.  Very good appendix.  Also, good for the experienced developer.  Before buying this book, make sure you know JAVA 2 very well.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn wireless JAVA.</span>

                    <span>This book may be taken as the introduction to start learning J2ME MIDlet programming. There are step-by-step instructions to download and install J2ME to the PC, and code, compile and run your first MIDlets. These are helpful for the beginner. On the other hand, make sure that you already know Java2. This is not a book for ground-up learning J2ME. The book is MIDP oriented, therefore do not expect much for CLDC coverage except a brief introduction. I have not managed to run all of the examples, even the 'originals' downloaded from the publisher's site. It was frustrating. You need to have a Palm device to test your MIDlets for Palm OS, because only 12 pages are spared for MIDP for Palm OS with no mention about the desktop PC emulator, but there are about 50 odd pages for J2ME APIs. You may take this book as the first step for J2ME without too much expectations, and be prepared to buy more books in order to master on the subject.</span>

                    <span>Mohmoud does an excellent job of distilling what is sine qua non to creating working midlets for various platforms.  After explaining how to create J2ME programs using the command line he goes own to show how it can be done using contemporary graphical tools from Sun.  You quickly reach the critical mass of being competent due to the author's good habit of presenting short lists of steps that lead toward program production.<p>One could wish that he spent more time discussing development for the Palm OS, JMS, RMI and XML.  However, if the book continues to mature the way Oreilly books due, we can expect to see this and more in the next edition.<p>If you are looking to understand J2ME development and have on-hand quick-start help this book is for you.  Chapters 3,7, and 8  quickly relate the important points and provide a helpful teaching context.  It may not be enough for someone who has already begun the work of creating J2ME applications.</span>

                    <span>I am new to Wireless Java, but I have some practical knowledge of Java itself. The book provided me with super information on Wirless Java and how to develop MIDlets. The book is super easy to read and the examples are informative. The introduction to J2ME (chapter 1) is excellent: everything is put in context. The examples on MIDP networking are _excellent_. The MIDP4PlamOS chapter is pretty good -- I was able to install JavaHQ on my Palm device in no time. I converted some applications for the Palm and they are working great. I am loving this stuff. Thank you for an informative book. If you need a book to get started with Wireless Java get this one!<br>Regards,<br>Jack</span>
