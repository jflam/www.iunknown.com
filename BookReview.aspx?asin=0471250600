                    <span>This book does a great job of presenting all details of operating system design and operation. When appropriate, the authors point out how Linux, Solaris or Windows implements a given topic. This is valuable for software developers who work on these platform and need to understand how the scheduler is going to react if you spawn new threads/processes.
<br />
<br />The one bad thing I can say is that some examples are too general and do not convey the proper detail. This is just a minor distraction and does not take away from the book's overall effectiveness.</span>

                    <span>It's been around 13 years since I took a course on OSes. I decided to purchase this book as a reference and to review some of the material that I have not had to deal with for a long time (e.g. synchronization primitives). I found the book to be a poor reference and found the chapters that I read to have poor or lacking exposition of the principles, data structures, and algorithms involved. e.g. there were sections where he lists pseudocode and says "see fig 2.13 for the algorithm" with no discussion of the reasoning behind the algorithm. The book also did not take any time to discuss practical considerations, e.g. implementing synchronization primitives with modern optimizing compilers and on modern out-of-order memory systems.
<br />
<br />I am looking for a better substitute, and for now would suggest passing on this book.</span>

                    <span>Well, IT'S A MUST READ FOR CS PEOPLE! It explaines the concepts of modern OS very well. It's not a book teaching you how to code your Mini-OS for the course assignment, but you will learn lots of fundamental OS components at a higher level abstraction: Memory Management, Process vs. Thread, File Systems, etc. There are lots of other books talking about OS implementation, this is not the one focus on specific details of implementation. 
<br />
<br />I've read this book several times in fact, everytime I figure out sth. new and learn more. I enjoy reading this book. Don't expect go through it in couple of days, and say "I know OS now", it's not gonna happen.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is OK for its first few pages of each chapter, i.e. the intro part, you (an undergraduate ) can use to get a brief understanding of some basic concepts, but if you want to really understand something thouroughly, this is a very bad book, for example, the proof of the mutual exclusion algorithms in Chapter 7 is very clumsy and confusing, it's actually easier to look at the code and reason yourself. 
<br />
<br />for most of the deeper reasoning about the alorithms in the book, it's much better to read the original papers. 
<br />
<br />some of the sentences in Chapter 7 seem to be copied without much  effor by the author from original papers.
<br />
<br />probably the 3 reasons you can use this book is
<br />(1) the simple intro part
<br />(2) the code in the book is simplified and probably uses more meaningful mnemonics than those in original paper ( not exactly, for some, it's even more weird !!)
<br />(3) use it as a bibliography to the papers, which , you really should read for understanding</span>
