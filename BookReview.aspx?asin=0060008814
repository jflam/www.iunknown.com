                <span id="Label1"><p>The Internet stock bubble wasn't just about goggle-eyed day traderstrying to get rich on the Nasdaq and goateed twenty-five-year-oldsplaying wannabe Bill Gates. It was also about an America that believed it had discovered the secret of eternal prosperity: it said something about all of us, and what we thought about ourselves, as the twenty-first century dawned. John Cassidy's Dot.con brings this tumultuous episode to life. Moving from the Cold War Pentagon to Silicon Valley to Wall Street and into the homes of millions of Americans, Cassidy tells the story of the great boom and bust in an authoritative and entertaining narrative. Featuring all the iconic figures of the Internet era -- Marc Andreessen, Jeff Bezos, Steve Case, Alan Greenspan, and many others -- and with a new Afterword on the aftermath of the bust, Dot.con is a panoramic and stirring account of human greed and gullibility.</p></span>

                    <span>This is a good overview, albeit very superficial, of the factors that drove the irrational exhuberance of the late 90s.  The role of the financial media, the so-called stock analysts, and others is explored and the consequence of the synergistic effects on the collective mind of the suckers who invested in the dot.com companies is highlighted.  Despite the book develops a dry topic, the book is an easy read; it reads well and will most certainly capture the interest of many readers.  On the negative side, this book can hardly be regarded as objective; the author has most certainly an ideological resentment against the Fed and Greenspan in particular.  This is not necessarily a bad thing - however, the criticism revolves around serious innacuracies in terms of the outlook and the role of Greenspan and the Fed in the NASDAQ crash.     It is unfortnate that the author had to resort to blatant lies when describing how the Fed and Greenspan viewed the role of the Internet and the growth of the dot.com stock bubble.  Readers looking for a an interesting non-fiction book, may be keen to read this book but serious analysts of the background of the NASDAQ debacle should look elsewhere - the inaccuracies are far too overwhelming. </span>

                    <span>As someone who spent most of the 1990s in junior high and high school, this book was a fascinating entree into the "irrational exhuberance" of the 1990s dot.com era, when any business remotely related to the internet could go public for millions (if not billions) of dollars, even with steady losses and without a solid business plan.  It was amazing to me to read about the number of investors who would buy stock in companies that hadn't proven anything, but simply had a website and believed they could tap into a certain percentage of an already- existing market.  This book gives you an understanding of how AOL, a brand new company with much lower annual profits, could essentially acquire Time Warner, a larger company that had shown the test of time.  More than that, the book shows you how investors - in fact, all of America - were overtaken by greed, irrationality, and a pack mentality that was ultimately detrimental.  I wasn't mature enough during the 90s to really understand what was going on, and so I'm glad I read this book.</span>

                    <span>    Well the book breaks it down to here was this quick and easy way to make money quick and Dot.Com stocks became way more then their real worth.  Too much money investments,too many web-sites run by geeks who have no business sense, and little brain power led to the demise of this business trend just as fast as it began.  Today the Internet is largly used by geeks who have no life and no class either.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I am a bit mystified by the fellow's remarks (as I am often mystified by Amazon reviewers) who says that there is little here that is new to a reader who kept abreast of the internet explosion (and subsequent implosion) in the New York Times, Forbes, and Wired.  First of all, would he rather have had author John Cassidy make up some new facts to embellish an already incredible story?  Or is he simply unable to see what a masterful synthesis of information his book is -- not to mention an insightful and cogent analysis of exactly what happened during the "Technological Gold Rush" of the New Millenium?  Or does he think it might be better for the average reader to wade through more than a decades' pile of Forbes, New York Times, and Wired periodicals rather than read this book?  (Actually, anyone who can read through a copy of Wired once should be commended!)
<br />
<br />Anyway, the story that Cassidy tells may not be an ennobling one, but it is certainly an astonishing and entertaining one, filled with hubris, greed, hype, charlatanism -- along with imagination, drama, and hope, too.  Here from p. 314 is what might be considered its thesis:
<br />
<br />"In retrospect, the period from 1989 to 2001 looks like an historic aberration, an extended time-out, during which the normal conditions of human conflict and international rivalry were temporarily suspended (for most people living in the West, at least).  In this vacuum, technological utopianism and several other varieties of mushy thinking flourished."
<br />
<br />At any rate, I strongly suspect that people will be reading this book fifty years from now in order to get a contemporary account of what happened.</span>

<br />
<br />A "vast Shakespearean farce"--that's John Cassidy's take on the Internet bubble. Dot.con is an intellectually rewarding book. The writing is exceptional, the research impeccable. Like a fastidious historian, Cassidy tracks the bubble from its beginnings to its demise, including the economic and psychological ramifications of Sept 11th, 2001. Besides Schiller's "Irrational exuberance" and Startup.com, a documentary, dot.con stands as one of the best accounts of the dot.com debacle. Highly recommended.</span>
