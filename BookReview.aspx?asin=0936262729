                    <span>I work for a small community newspaper and have recently started to shoot sports. I was hoping for an in-depth information focusing specifically on sports, rather than general photography. In general, I was disappointed. Although the book was published in 2000, it felt like the information in it was years behind the times.<P>There were some elementary errors in it. For example a lens at F2.8 lets in twice as much light as a lens at F 4, rather than four times as the book states. The coverage of sports other than football, baseball and basketball was extremely superficial - just a paragraph or two. Also many photos were unsharp and just not that good. I can look at the Washington Post's sports section any day and see better photos. There was hardly any discussion of using the capabilities of modern professional cameras, which was something I was very interested in. This book may be useful for high school students thinking about going into photography, but does not have much for someone who is familiar with general photography.</span>

                    <span>The information provided in this book helps one select their field of choice for sports photography. The tips are helpful. Once you study the composition of the pictures and not the people's clothes and hairstyles, you're able to better understand the author's advice.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed the author's use of photos, I just wish I'd had a copy of this book when I was younger. Some photos were older, but the principles behind the photography and techniques don't change. I like the tips on the little things, such as non-slip shoes on wet surfaces, and where not to take photos, such as two contrasty areas, brightly sunlit and sharply shadowed. I've already shown it to a couple of up-and-coming high-school athletic photographers I know.</span>

                    <span>The book gives detailed explanations of how to shoot various sports photos, even what type of lens to use. It emphasizes capturing the emotions, which I wish more sports photographers would do, maybe I would enjoy the sports sections of the newspapers more. Mr. Arndt displays many creative and timely photographs in his book. Many of the tips can be used in any action type photography, not just sports.</span>
