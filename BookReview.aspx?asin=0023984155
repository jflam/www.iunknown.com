                    <span>Review after 2 years of using this book:  AMAZING BOOK.  There has never been a better book (and probably never will be) in explaining OR.
<br />
<br />Previous Review upon purchase:
<br />If you are taking a graduate or an undergraduate course in OR, this book is a must!  I have not seen ANY book able to present OR with such simple, direct examples and WITHOUT sacrificing theory.
<br />This is the best written textbook I have ever read.  When I compare it with the hundereds of dollars I spend on badly written books, even as a PG (poor graduate) student I would gladly pay twice of what this book is priced at.</span>

                    <span>I got my B.S.E. in Industrial & OPS Eng. from U of Michigan.  During that time, I had to take a course in Linear/Math. Programming.  The course content was simple, but the book we used was TERRIBLE!!.  Now finishing my M.S., I used this book in an OR class for my Masters Prog, and it is THE BEST BOOK!  I literally read it page by page.  It is the best written, hand holding book to a rather complicated subject.  I got an A in the class, and gained great understanding.  This is a book I WILL KEEP FOREVER, a great reference for the workplace as well!!!</span>

                    <span>I had absolutely no clue about optimization before I read this book. This book not only helped me overcome my diffidence, but also provided me with a very thorough understanding of the basics of the subject. <p>It is extremely difficult to criticize this book in any way. The language is plain English, not the technical jargon which other "introductory" books use. The book does not assume that the reader has a thorough understanding of linear algebra. Only a course in differential and integral calculus will do. The book provides several primers on a lot of topics- matrices, analysis, vectors etc., so that you do not have to interrupt your optimization studies and digress into these subjects. <p>There are three full chapters where the author provides real-life examples of mathematical modeling. Again, these are built up step-by-step, and not shoved down your throat.<p>The different approach to the Simplex Method is more intuitive than the traditional approach and more logical. The basic discussions on integer programming and non-linear programming are also worth mentioning. The numerous exercises and the presence of solutions to a number of them in the end make the text even more helpful.<p>The only somewhat weak point of the text is the chapter on interior point methods, where the book only provides the formulae and states that the derivations are "beyond the scope of the book". But, this is negligible and I recommend the book wholeheartedly</span>

                    <span>I thought there was only one best complete OR book is Hillier and Lieberman (H&L) until I got Rardin's book. Rardin presents the OR in different approach than H&L. The model building part is a little bit better than H&L, but the real meat is the fundamental of optimization. Search technique is well presented from the ground-up. This book can be served as the first book in OR if you're new to OR or the companion book if you know OR or even the first book in optimization in case you don't care to know OR.</span>
