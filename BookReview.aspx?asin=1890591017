                    <span>If you only read one book about the Donner Party, make it this one!  The Donner Chronicles tells the story of doomed pioneers and their struggle to survive. It keeps the reader at the edge of his seat and provides great detail of the period and the people. Highly recommended for history buffs who want to read history as though it's a novel instead of a dry textbook. Great photos, maps and graphics add to the text. </span>

                    <span>Frank Mullen has added an important book to the history of Donner Party.  The tragedy has been the focus of writing since the spring of 1847, but Mullen has found a fresh way to make the story understandable and, perhaps more importantly, human.  <p>The book is a daily chronolgy of the year that it took the party to travel from Illinois to California, and each two-page spread of this large book is carefully laid out and presents a mix of graphics and text.  It is rewarding if read straight through, yet very accessible if your reading style is more "grazing" than linear.<p>Mullen clearly has done his homework.  The sheer volume of detail and complexity in the story can be overwhelming, and Mullen includes the details that are needed to clarify and develop the people in the story.  He includes wonderful quotes from diaries and supporting material, and drawings of interesting side issues such as an analysis of the probable shape of the "Pioneer Palace Car."  Additionally, Marilyn Newton's photographs of the trail as seen today make it real for a modern reader.<p>When I have given this book as a gift to anyone with an interest in American History, it has been very well received.  A truly great book.</span>

                    <span>The full-color, glossy photographs of major landmarks and points of interest along the Emigrant Trail from Springfield, MO to Johnson's Ranch in Bear Valley are stunning.  The color photos, all taken by Marilyn  Newton, are grouped together in the beginning of the book, comprising 20  slick pages of almost 50 photos.  It's hard to believe that wagon ruts from  over 150 years ago still exist in places; happily, our continuous farming,  building and paving haven't obliterated all traces of the route that so  many people rode--and walked--in order to reach California.<p>Portraits,  maps, drawings and sketches from the period are interspersed with  sepia-toned contemporary photographs, some taken by Newton and some by  other photographers, and appear on every page of the book.  "The  Donner Party Chronicles" is visually rich and stimulating.  The area  around Donner Lake and the route the relief parties followed are depicted  in all seasons of the year.  Even in black-and-white, the photos of Donner  Lake and the surrounding mountains demonstrate the ruggedness of the  terrain and deeply impress upon the reader the hopelessness the members of  the Donner Party must have felt upon being snowed-in at the lake.<p>The  book reads like a journal that would have been kept by one of the emigrants  traveling with the Donner Party.  The text is reprinted from installments  journalist Frank Mullen, Jr. published in the weekly newspaper "The  Reno Gazette-Journal" over the course of an entire year.  The daily  routine followed, problems encountered, and decisions made by the Donner  Party are chronicled in a concise manner.  The entries are short, most  three or four paragraphs in length.<p>One very interesting feature of  "The Donner Party Chronicles" is the map of the Emigrant Trail  that appears on every left-hand page of the book, with the progress of the  doomed emigrants clearly marked with a red dot.  As you read along through  the book, you see on every other page exactly where the emigrants were as  the day's events took place.  I found this map extremely helpful and  fascinating.  Watching the movement of the Donner Party as they traveled on  foot at the pace of slow, plodding oxen made me better able to understand  how great an undertaking their overland journey was.  I shared this book  with my husband, my Dad and my father-in-law, and they enjoyed it almost as  much as I did!<p>This book is well worth the price, for the interesting  text as well as the terrific photos;  you can easily find what you're  looking for in the pages, as each page is dated and the day's entry fairly  short.</span>

                    <span>The strong point of the book is the day by day account of the Donner Party's journey.   Mullen writes as if he were actually on the trail with the party, and the reader has that same sense of  being there. Mullen's  writing style makes this book the best Donner Party telling since George  Stewart's Ordeal By Hunger.</span>
