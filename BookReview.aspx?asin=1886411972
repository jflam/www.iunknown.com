                <span id="Label1">THE ART OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE is a practical and comprehensive guide to assembly language. It presents assembly language from the high-level programmer's point of view, allowing the reader to start writing meaningful assembly language programs immediately. The CDROM includes the High Level Assembler (HLA) tool and the HLA Standard Library, all the source code from the book, plus over 50,000 lines of additional sample code, all well-documented and tested.</span>

                    <span>I first learned assembly language programming with the 16-bit edition of this book found on the internet. So naturally, I rushed out and bought the hard copy when it became available. My first thought was that "this is not the assembly language I'm used to." This book uses a new type of assembler, a High Level Assembler, for all of the examples. At first, I was completely put off by this approach - it was completely foreign to me. But then I realized that this book was not meant for people like myself who have been programming in assembly for years, instead it was created for people who know a high level language and want to learn assembly. Once I realized this, I began to see this book in a whole different light. The organization is perfect for someone who has a high level language background and is learning assembly for the first time. Although "old-timers" such as myself probably won't find this approach to their liking, I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is learning assembly language for the first time. While I do not have the perspective of learning assembly language using HLA, I am convinced that the author is correct that this is a good approach for beginners approaching the language.</span>

                    <span>I goofed around with Java for a few months, but it never sparked my interest in programming. That all changed when I found this book. I had always thought of assembly as an 'elite' language that can be mastered only by experienced programmers. Hyde's approach makes it easy to learn assembly whether you have experience in high level languages or you are just a beginner in programming. The book does a great job of teaching the machine level implementation of concepts that are the back-bone of other programming languages.<P>Hyde's assembly language compiler (HLA) also comes packed with a very powerful integrated macro system and run-time language. You actually get two languages in one. Couple that with loads of white-pages and support material that extend what you learn in the book and you have one impressive package for learning assembly.</span>

                    <span>'fastluck from Tijeras, NM USA' posted a 1 star review for this book, basically the reason why is you could not get the libraries and code to work. I just bought this book after visiting the Webster site and within 10 Minutes of configuring Environment Variables and installing HLA and MASM, I had my first working program. So I am not sure why you could not get it working?</span>

                    <span>As another reviewer said, this book should be called "The Art of HIGH LEVEL Assembly Language." This is a great book. It is well written and has includes a CD-ROM chock full of good stuff. Problem is that if you want to use MASM, NASM, TASM or some other assembler that uses real ASM you will likely be confused as the HLA stuff that you learned from this book will not totally apply to traditional ASM. If you are wanting to learn ASM and eventually use NASM and other normal assemblers (ie: not HLA) then you might be better off with a book like "Assembly Language for Intel-Based Computers (4th Edition)" by Kip R. Irvine or my favorite "Introduction to 80X86 Assembly Language and Computer Architecture" by Richard C. Detmer.</span>

                    <span>i bought this book via amazon.com. firstly, it is not the same book as the online version. This book is the condensed version. Lots of unimportant but entertaining stuffs from the online version are gone ! Thus making this book like a reference manual. Perhaps the publisher was trying to cut down on paper costs ? The title of this book is deceiving. Though it talks alot about ASM but its primary focus is HLA. Still, it's a great ASM/HLA book that covers the basics and the advanced stuffs. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to know the fundamentals of ASM.</span>
