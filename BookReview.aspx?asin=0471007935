                    <span>The author has used her sources effectively to delineate the Intenet boom and its subsequent fall, by describing Yahoo's growth from a Stanford trailer into a media company. She has captured the frenzy of the late 90's and takes the reader through the numerous accquisitions and investments in Silicon Valley. At the same time the book is an overkill with the excessive information provided and at times reads like an encyclopaedia with figures thrown in liberally. The fact that Yahoo hasn't cooperated with the author is evident in several places. Overall its a good read</span>

                    <span>Like many other writers about technology companies, Karen Angel has simply read a lot of newspaper and magazine articles about the company, interviewed some knowledgeable outsiders (key insiders did not cooperate with her) and organized the resulting material in chronological sequence. If, like I, you are interested in learning the basic facts about Yahoo!, this book will suffice, but don't expect anything in the way of new revelations or searching analysis.<p>What comes across is a group of relatively bright young computer nerds who happened to be in the right place at the right time, decided that they were the Christ, and imploded from their own greed and hubris, professing all the while their personal integrity. Urrrppp!</span>

                    <span>Inside Yahoo! presents a blow-by-blow chronology of the birth, ascension and downfall of a company that - in terms of business model and stock price - was the archetype of the `90s dot-com. Readers will be hard pressed to identify any relevant fact or event from the life of Yahoo! overlooked by author Karen Angel. What is missed however, is meaty analysis: Did the hubris of Yahoo!'s founders contribute to the company's reversal of fortunes? Angel doesn't speculate. Nevertheless, we from getAbstract recommend her book for its comprehensive recounting of a business tale that truly captures the essence of the Internet boom.</span>

                    <span>Of course, when you think Internet, YAHOO! comes to mind immediately. Here it's fascinating to read about the key players, with their contrasting personalities and ingenuity, behind the very modest beginnings of Yahoo!--from a trailer on Stanford U's campus. That's an inspiration for all of us wanna-be's.... And then to watch this dot.com swell to Internet behemoth worth $100+ billion on the stock market--along the way, missing scooping up now-strong e-Bay! Memorable too that a teen hacker even took down this Goliath for a while.... Yahoo did not burn through its venture capital like many others but it failed to leverage its burgeoning superstatus in the marketplace and to fully respond to the competition. The story is a rollercoaster ride with big names you'll recognize and other names you'll come to appreciate, along with some business insights for facing new challenges ahead. A good, absorbing read. This book is important for American business history and for your own dot.com literacy. Highly recommended.  -M.J.</span>

                    <span>Where does Yahoo go from here?  In order to answer this effectively, it is important to understand Yahoo's history and culture, and how it arrived at today's crossroads.  This book does a wonderful job of providing this information.  Especially the first chapters detailing the formation of the company are very interesting.  However, I rate it a 4 instead of 5 for the following reasons:<p>(1) In it's bid to be comprehensive about all details, the book sometimes attains the tone of a documentary rather than a gripping story (especially in chapters towards the end).  And it treats all stories big and small somewhat uniformly, inlcuding the "eBay acquisition miss", and "Yahoo's inactivity during AOL's purchase of Time Warner", which in hindsight seem to be two important "mis-steps", and probably deserve a more in-depth coverage.<p>(2) Given the author's understanding of the subject company, and various contacts tapped for writing the book, I would have expected at the end a good, detailed discussion of what might be various prescriptions for the future.  Especially since this is still a story in progress.<p>These points notwithstanding, the book is well worth reading by any one wishing to understand Yahoo, and the excitement caused by the internet era.</span>
