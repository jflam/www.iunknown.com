                    <span>Wonderful read, and unlike such weightier classics as THE ART OF WAR or THE BOOK OF FIVE RINGS, this one is readily accessible to the western mind.
<br />
<br />After reading it twice, I came to think that everything after the first chapter -- nay, after the first two paragraphs -- was mere repetition. This is because all the behaviors and philosophies the author recommends would be the natural consequence if one truly were to "keep death in mind at every possible moment."
<br />
<br />The book is a series of short chapters like "Loyalty," "Finances," "Personal Appearance;" each describing the ideal behavior of an ideal samurai with respect to each.
<br />
<br />I can't comment on the organization or skill of Cleary's translation, though, since I know of no other version of this book. However I am inclined to think it is adept, since the nature of the work suggests the original Japanese would be extremely stiff. This is not the case with the English.
<br />
<br />Gripes:
<br />
<br />1. Note that this is a thin book; you can read it in about an hour. I was expecting something much thicker, at least the size of THE UNFETTERED MIND, say.
<br />
<br />2. Oscar Ratti's illustrations will be disappointing to those familiar with his work in SECRETS OF THE SAMURAI and AIKIDO: THE DYNAMIC SPHERE. There are only a handful of them, and that handful isn't very interesting.
<br />
<br />3. The binding of this book came apart rather quickly, after just the first read. Perhaps just my copy, though.
<br />
<br />4. Sadly, the introduction by Cleary is completely forgettable.</span>

                    <span>I was so upset after I finished reading this book.  I wish it wasn't updated and they just kept it in its original version.  If you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values, this is the wrong book.  Read Bushido: The Soul of Japan.  The Code of The Samurai really felt like The Code of the Japanese Business Man.</span>

                    <span>I teach martial arts. My eight year old son, who also happens to be one of my students, talked me into buying this book for him on his birthday. Since it wasn't a graphic novel and I wanted to encourage his reading I went ahead and picked up a copy for him even though I didn't think he was really ready for it. He not only read the whole thing, but he really seemed to understand the text as well. I was frankly amazed. Soooo, on an eight-year old's recommendation I picked up the book and began to read it myself. A couple hours later I found I couldn't put it down.
<br />
<br />This is a compelling, well written translation. It is fascinating and, for the most part, still relevant to modern life. Many of us who pursue the martial path do so in part to build good character, enhance mental discipline, develop physical conditioning, and of course, learn skills for self-defense. Yet the package is not complete in my opinion without a solid understanding of Japanese culture and history. After all, it played a huge role in forming what we do. This book is a great place to start learning that aspect of the martial arts.

                    <span>Seems well translated, but I only say this based upon how clearly it read.  I was looking for a broken English sort of style and it was instead very easy to read.  Amazing what the Samurai understood.  Recommended reading for anyone interested in Asian history or even to see what someone wrote without an American upbringing.  Can you imagine someone understanding these nuances of behavior without growing up in a "civilized" country? 
<br />
<br />An amazing ride for anyone's conscience.</span>

                    <span>At first glance, this is just a wonderful historical relic. It's stiff and formal, as you might expect of a guide to proper behavior. It was meant to guide young men of the warrior class in an era when war was a fading memory. Even in its day, somewhere around 1700AD, during the Tokugawa era, it was probably a bit old-fashioned.<p>For all that, Shigesuke's advice is remarkably applicable to modern society. Things like loyalty to an employer have almost gone out of style. Today's employers are different, but some employees need the reminder that a paycheck imposes obligations on the receiver. The advice about treating one's wife with courtesy is painfully up to date, as counter-examples in every day's news will show. The idea of maintaining professional skills, even when not immediately needed, is still quite current. So are the needs for basic skills in social setting and for basic education.<p>I am not a student of martial arts. I am a participant in today's business world. This slim volume still has something to say to me, in this different place and century.</span>
