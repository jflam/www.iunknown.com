                    <span>I used this book to teach an undergraduate course on leadership.  The book was not my choice.  The articles and research were edited in such a way that the reader really didn't feel that any of the theories were supported or substantiated by the data.  <p>If it was the authors' intention to leave room for personal reflection and opinion, they succeeded.  As for the assessments, the text, including the instructor's manual, provided little direction for interpretation.<p>I wish Pierce and Newstrom spent more time on and went into greater detail with the chapter introductions.</span>

                    <span>(2nd ed.)  This book is a compendium of 44 articles on leadership, intended for higher education audiences, especially management students in college.  The authors also include 19 self-assessment instruments for the reader.  The book finishes with 11 case studies and "experiential" exercises (as opposed, I guess, to cognitive exercises?).  <p>The topics are slanted toward social-psychological (roles, gender effects, group dynamics, leader behaviors, cross-cultural contexts, and so forth).  As a result, the writings can be tediously "scientific."  The book is very well referenced, but, as the authors state, it is not a review of the leadership literature.<p>The cover drawing is one of five people putting sails on a boat that is not in the water.  I presume this is sort of a Magritte comment on leadership.  I think it also is a comment on the patchwork tedium of the subject.  And after all the sails are on, what does one know about leadership?  And, is one a leader?</span>
