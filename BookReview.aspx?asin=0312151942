                    <span>This book is great! It brought up all the plus' and minus' of some of the greatest movies ever. The author expresses the same thoughts taht many of us have about these movies - yes they are often cheesy, but they are FUN! If you remember the 80's fondly, you'll love this book.</span>

                    <span>I can sum up my review of this book rather simply: don't buy it, but do read it; borrow it from the library instead.<P>A fun romp through the fabulous Brat Pack movies of the 80s, Bernstein's book is a little too short on analysis, a little too full of plot, and offers tantalizing teases of trivia and behind the scenes information but never delivers a whallop punch. It's fun, light reading, and entertaining enough, but it doesn't truly serve as a reference material to the subject, and as such, I wouldn't recommend it as something worth purchasing for your book collection. By all means, take a copy out from the library and spend a fun weekend flipping through its pages -- I wish I had done that, instead of spending money on a copy that now gathers dust on the shelves.</span>

                    <span>and an index, too. But still, Bernstein's book is quite witty and entertaining and it did more to bring back memories of the '80s than THE WEDDING SINGER did. I only wish that more pictures of some of the lesser-known talents of the day (Mary Stuart Masterson, especially) had been printed. Way too much ink was wasted on Judd Neslon. Not cool, but recommended reading nevertheless. Peace, bro.</span>

                    <span>I was a teenager in the 80's and I loved these movies. This book outlines all the "Teen" movies in the 1980's, from "Porky's" to "Can't Buy Me Love" It was a fun trip down memory lane and I enjoyed learning some lesser known facts about the movies and actors themselves. A must have for affecionado's of the 80's. Includes smaller versions of some of the most popular movies original movie theater posters.</span>

                    <span>I've read a few books in my time. Good ones, bad ones. Some that were neither -- you know what I mean, gentle reader, both good and bad at the same time. Sometimes a book will start out good and end up bad. Sometimes, and I find this is the more rare phenomenon, the book will start out bad and then pull a "U-Turn" and end up good. That may in fact be my favorite kind of book.</span>
