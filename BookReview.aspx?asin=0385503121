                    <span>Only reason I'm not giving one star is simply because Dodson had access that no other writer was previously granted.  I can only imagine what Curt Sampson would have done with all this extra information.  The only reason I made it through this book is because I'm a Hogan geek.  Anyone remotely well versed in Hogan's history will notice a factual error in just about every chapter.  And for those not well versed in Hogan's history, there are many basic golf facts that don't make sense.  I write this without the book in front of me, but one instance still stands out:  Dodson refers to a 10 birdie round of 64 - with no bogeys.  I know times have changed, but I don't recall many par 74 courses back in the day.  By itself, this can seem like an innocent mistake, maybe even a typo.  But when you pair it with the 100 other similar mistakes you lose credibility in the author.  You also get the idea that Dodson himself isn't very familiar with the game of golf itself - the type of guy who keeps score on his wrist watch and uses 'golf' as a verb.  The last half of the book I was just reading to find a decent quote or two.  There's a reason Sampson's book was so popular and this one wasn't.  </span>

                    <span>I just finished this book last night and think it was perfectly written.  I can't imagine a more in-depth look at the life of the greatest golfer to ever walk the planet.  I highly recommend it to anyone that considers himself a fan of the game of golf. </span>

                    <span>As a golf professional and long time Hogan fan I was astounded at the information Dodson was able to present in his tome on Hogan.  Many of the accepted standard practices in the golfing world and terminology originated with Hogan.  'Course management' is one Hoganism I wasn't aware of.  A testament to the value of perseverance through holding an ambition for a long period of time...to falling and getting up time and again, this book will inspire you and sadden you but ultimately keep you turning its pages.</span>

                    <span>Having read previous books about Ben Hogan, I was reluctant to start reading this one. Of the three books I had ordered "Brother Ray" actually was what I wanted to read first, but I thought.."I'll get this one out of the way first and then enjoy reading Brother Ray". What can I say. When I turned the last page I was wishing there were 100 more!
<br />Having grown up in a family of golfers, Ben Hogan represented to me, via my family members, what it meant to be the absolute best in a sport. Unfortunately, my father, being introduced to Mr. Hogan through one of the sources quoted in the book, encountered the Hogan that was so often described in the press as anything BUT friendly.
<br />Nonetheless, the encounter and subsequent opinions of Mr. Hogan never changed in my household. Here for the first time is an account of a life that not only inspires it's readers but states clearly the fundamental values that were so much a part of life at that time. As the end of the book nears and Hogans death is imminent, you cant help but feel that the ever elusive "5th National Open" is still within his grasp.
<br />Hopefully Ben Hogan, like so many other greats of long ago, will never be forgotten. More importantly, hopefully the values and ethics that were Ben Hogan, will one day re-assert themselves in American society. </span>

                    <span>I have to admit three things in the interest of full disclosure. One - I am an unabashed James Dodson fan - I have read everything he has written and have enjoyed them all. Two - If anyone other than James Dodson had written this book, I would have never read it. Three - I am now an unabashed Ben Hogan person, because I now know the story of his life which has been told in a truthful and powerful manner. I wish I had seen more of him and I wish that when I did see him on television that I would have appreciated what I was looking at.
<br />
<br />James Dodson has written several books about his own personal experiences which have been well received and rightly so, especially the book, Final Rounds, which put him on the literary map. He was also Arnold Palmer's "co-author" for his auto-biography, a pleasant book and which achieved Jim's goal of having the reader feel that he had the chance to sit down and have a few Scotches with "The King." 
<br />
<br />In this book, he is working without a net. He has accepted the challange and the honor of being the family authorized biogapher of one of the greatest golfers of all time. In recreating "An American Life" he has devoted at least three years of his life to the research necessary to marshall the facts. Then he had to take the results of his research and do justice to the lives of Ben and Valerie Hogan. No easy chore.
<br />
<br />In judging how succesful he was I have to only look at my perception of Hogan before I read the book. He was basicallly a name from the past. (I am 66) His greatest accomplishments were not on TV. He was said to be aloof. A loner. A perfectionist. 
<br />
<br />When he finally made it to TV, he was past his prime, but still playing well enough. He was a ghost hanging around in the early days of Palmer, Nicklaus and Player. He was a "black and white guy" in the early days of color TV.
<br />
<br />James Dodson peels that all away and exposes the heart and soul of the man. He does it honestly. Warts and all. But the image that is left with the reader is one of wishing that you could have met him and if not that, watched him play at the height of his career and if not that, been able to share a lunch and a "see-through" with him at Shady Oaks.
<br />
<br />If you consider yourself a golfer, you owe it to yourself to read this book. And you owe it to Ben Hogan.
