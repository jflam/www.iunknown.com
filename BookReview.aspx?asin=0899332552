                    <span>I have several of these of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Duplicates of each... one in the house for planning and study, one in the truck. Occasionally I rotate them so they don't wear out too quickly.  I gave Delorme top billing in my Desert Emergency Survival Basics book, but you don't need a desert and you don't need an emergency to need a delorme atlas.  Any rural area in the United States is probably covered by them.  <p>If you spend a lot of time in the back country these maps are the best alternative, from my point of view. It's true the maps don't have labels on the back country cow trails another reviewer complained of. The fact is, neither do the roads. But it's often helpful when you come to the fork in a dirt two-track and they both wander off a few degrees off North, to be able to crack open the Delorme and discover the one on the left plays out just over that hill over there at a windmill. There's no excuse for needing labels these days. A compass and Delorme will allow you to locate yourself in most instances.<p>However, even the back woods purist ought to own a GPS. I've been wandering around the back woods longer than most readers of this have been alive. I rarely get lost, but I frequently don't know exactly where I am. Occasionally my old TrailBlazer saved me a lot of walking to get back to the truck. Once it saved my life in a snowstorm, I imagine.<p>For motor traveling you'll cover too much ground to allow the 7.5 minute maps to help much. You pass from one map to the next too quickly. When you are afoot a couple of them become useful. Meanwhile, I use Delorme as one of the ways to keep track of my wanderings. I recommend them wherever you are. And a GPS, as well.</span>

                    <span>There are a lot of dirt roads that cover the BLM and National Forests of Utah, and this book has them.  It doesn't replace hiking maps, but if you have a 4wd or high clearance vehical and want to explore Utah on dirt roads, this is for you.<p>It also lists camping and fishing sites accross the state.   A word of warning.  Dotted red lines may only be passable by 4wd vehicals.  <p>It would also be great for planning Snowmobile outings or  4-wheeler camp trips.  Have fun.</span>
