                    <span>  Into the second chapter I was weary if this book was going to live up to its reviews.  I was disappointed with the coverage of the explanations given.  So why 5 stars?
<br />
<br />  As I continued I began to understand what the author was trying to give the reader.  Reil describes guidlines for creating OO software, around 60 to be specific.  This is so what makes the book so fantastic.  Riel has, through much experience, collected a list of specific 'rules' or 'heuristics' that should be applied to your OO designs.  These rules set out to answer the million dollar question, 'is this a good design?'.  The rules are one or two sentences each, and therefore easy to remember, and are all listed in the front and back cover for quick reference.  Each rule is backed by a clear example, as well as sample C++ code in the appendix.
<br />
<br />  Any reader should be able to apply the simple rules easily as they go through the design process.  This will not only give you confidance in your designs, but something to actually back them up.  For example, if asked "Why did you make a uses relationship between these two classes instead of inheriting B from A?" you can reply, either to yourself or a co-worker, "Heuristic 5.15 - Do not turn objects of a class into derived classes of the class.  Be very suspicious of any derived class for which there is only one instance."
<br />
<br />  Of course, as Reil makes note, some rules will contradict each other, and he justifies what to do in such cases.
<br />
<br />  Finally, it should be noted that the book is highly centered on the C++ language, but is easily applied to the other languages of today - Java, C#, etc.  He does make several comparisons with SmallTalk.
<br />
<br />  If I was working on a design with someone, I would want to know that they have read and understood this book.  I hope it will live on, and will reccomend it to all my co-workers.</span>

                    <span>First, the greatness. These heuristics, rules of thumb, are true gems. The are short, memorable, and widely applicable. They are practical advice - Riel consciously avoids creating yet another methodology. Sooner or later, though, every methodology comes down to the tactical exercise of implementation. That's when you'll find Riel's advice useful, irrespective of how you started.<p>Riel certainly does not list the only heursitics possible. I might have added "Create classes when behavior differs; create objects when data differs", and I'm sure an experienced reader could add lots more. Some of these heuristics don't apply in all cases. "All base classes should be abstract," for example, might be tempered with concrete default bodies for some or all methods. Also, "All data should be hidden" is too dogmatic for me. It disregards 'const' or 'final' data elements including control constants, and deserves more discussion in the case of a subclass/superclass relationship. Still, the suggestions are generally good. Even better, they are phrased so as to invite thought and thoughtful critique by the reader.<p>I'm afraid that I did not find this book to be the ideal setting for these gems. Although the aphorisms are clear and concise, the prose around them is not. I know that publishers often prefer books of some minimum length, but padding does not serve the content well at all. Most of the book's second half is code listings. They certainly add bulk, but the book and the code both would have been better served by putting the code at the publisher's web site or on an included disk.<p>The discussion of each rule of thumb would have benefitted from a more disciplined style, too. For example, each heuristic could have been described methodically according to its applicability, the symptoms indicating that it should be used, and the code transformations needed to apply it. That's not the only format Riel could have used, and probably not the best. Almost anything would have given the book a more regular rhythm, however.<p>I like this book and I'll recommend it. It has aged a little since its 1996 printing, and wants desperately to be a more concise book. Still, it's a good complement to more recent discussions of patterns, antipatterns, and refactorings. I suggest it to anyone who develops or maintains OO code, and especially to anyone who teaches OO programming.</span>

                    <span>Allow me to add one more point to the excellent 5-star reviews that precede this one. As a long-time senior software developer, many of my peers and more junior engineers have asked me for a book recommendation so they can learn how to do object-oriented design. This is the book.<p>This is the book for UNDERSTANDING object-oriented software development. Whether you're learning OOD or improving your skills, this book makes OOD feel like common sense. As you read, the light clicks on and you think, "Oh. I get it," or, "Exactly!"<p>You won't need any other book on object-oriented design. This one is comprehensive and fun to read. And, it is perfect for a study group.<p>Don't learn OOD by making mistakes. Buy this book and design with confidence.</span>
