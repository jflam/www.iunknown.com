                <span id="Label1">You Are Worthless is the self-help book from hell. This bracing blast of negativity takes aim at the impossibly cheerful "inspirational self-help" books flooding the market and hits the bullseye, with chapters such as "Your Good-for-Nothing Friends," "Your Miserable Job," and "Life: What's the Use?"     This hilarious parody collects hundreds of tidbits of painful reality such as "You're no good, you're not great-looking, and you're going to die someday and it's probably going to hurt." Who among us isn't sick to death of the gushy, new-agey inspirational books that blindly assert that everyone is worthy? We all know the truth, and this book is as refreshing as a slap to the face.     Just some of the depressingly humorous nuggets of truth include:* You don't really have any outstanding qualities. It's safe to say you're pretty much just like everybody else.* The only reason your pet likes you is because you feed it.* As you get older, you are going to have less and less control over your bladder.* If you take a big risk and follow your dream, chances are you're going to fall flat on your face.     You Are Worthless also features a section called "Hopeless Role Models from History," including Helen Keller ("I've had it"), and Abraham Lincoln ("Theonly thing I'm good at is losing").</span>

                    <span>As an avid fan of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, I was thrilled to find Dikkers had written a book critiquing the feel-good self-help books that are so popular nowadays. However, once you get the "Paradigm" of "You are Worthless" (it's a "self-help" book that makes you "help-yourself!"), your spellboud throughout the book's 230 pages. Dikkers deftly writes page after page of constructive "advice" like "You are a toaster," "God made a great big world," and "Think about the sweet release of orgasm," and it never ceases to be illuminating. After about five such homilies you get exhausted. Frankly, a work of this sort of "Life's Little Instruction Book"-esque, bite-sized "wisdom" just seems entirely too perfect! Cleverly mean-spirited as Dikkers's mind is it's well within his abilities to do a brilliant anthology of, say, the "Jeffersons" series, or the "Gita" books in addition to this "One-To-Grow-On. Peace.</span>

Needless to say my mother was enlightened by the book and decided not to join the circus (since her life has nearly been spent and would probably not amount to anything).</span>

For anybody who appreciates satire and cynical humor, this book is a must. I haven't laughed so hard at anything else in my life, besides perhaps a couple timeless articles from the infamous spoof newspaper, The Onion.</span>
