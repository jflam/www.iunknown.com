                <span id="Label1">It happened more or less by accident; the people who made it happen were amateurs; and for the most part they still are.  From his own Silicon Valley garage, author Bob Cringley puts PC bigshots and nerds on the spot, and tells their incredible true stories.  Like the industry itself, the series is informative, funny and brash.  Some of the episode participants include: Bill Gates (Chairman of Microsoft, the richest man in the world), Steve Jobs (Hippie co-founder of Apple Computer; CEO of NeXT Computer; and the man who wanted to change the world), and Steve Wozniak (Co-founder of Apple Computer; engineering genius, practical joker).  <P>Written and Presented by: Bob Cringely  <P>All 3 volumes on 1 DVD:  <P>*Impressing Their Friends  <P>*Riding the Bear  <P>*Great Artists Steal  <P>DVD has English Sub-titles that can be turned on or off.</span>

                    <span>So there I was......browsing through Amazon.com and on "the page I made" up pops, guess what? Triumph of the Nerds on DVD. Seeing this, I was just reaching for my credit card to snap up a copy of it when BAM! I read one of the reviews......
<br />
<br />
<br />Still a great show, but the Ambrose edition is not complete!, October 28, 2004 
<br /> Reviewer:    Sean Breazeal (Mt. Pleasant, UT USA)
<br />
<br />I immediately checked with Bob, and Yes, sure enough, several minutes had been cut from the original US release for "space" requirements.
<br />In his defense, Bob had no input on this. Were it me? I'd be hopping mad.
<br />
<br />Instead of the publisher, Ambrose, using this opportunity to create a new and valuable product by adding deleted scenes, extended version, and extras, they chose to go on the cheap and cut to fit rather than make a product worth purchasing.
<br />
<br />Bob Cringely is a genius and is thorough in all he does. Had they used this chance to extend what was probably the best compilation of the modern 'net age and add what I'm sure was hours of extra content Bob had to cut, I'd have been the first guy willing to pay retail to buy it. Having purchased 3 copies of the boxed video set (1 lost to a fire, 1 lost to a non-returning friend) there would have been NO hesitation to this. In fact, I'd have watched it straight through on receipt.
<br />
<br />What a HORRIBLE, horrible mistake Ambrose has made.
<br />FIX IT!!!!
<br />
<br />Don't walk, RUN from this edition. I know it's Old school, but do yourself a favor and buy the video tape version. You'll thank me later.</span>

                    <span>Triumph of the Nerds is still one of the best public level documentaries about the origins and development of personal computers from their beginnings in the mid-70's on through the IBM/Apple years and into the mid-90's with the launch of Windows 95. It is dated somewhat, especially at the end with the forecasts about the future growth of the internet and what it would mean to PC and Mac development and the world. Nothing was truer then than remains today, predicting the long-term future of the computer and internet industry is simply impossible.
<br />
<br />What troubles me with this edition by Ambrose is that they have apparently sacrificed bits and pieces here and there for some unfathomable reason. The main points are all still there, but some of the side stories and flavors have been cut. Examples include Steve Wozniak's description of his early interest in electronics in finding an old AT&T phone company manual to learn to hack into the phone system to call the Pope. It cuts Steve Jobs' description of his early experiences with Bill Gates, saying that the original version of Word was "just terrible but they kept at it...", and someone whose name I can't remember describing the early mainframes and trying to use one as "you were lucky if your entire city had one mainframe, and, if your company had it, there would only be one."  These are the ones I noticed right off, I'm sure there are others and they are minor things, but it's troubling that a company buys the rights to a show and edits it for whatever reason rather than simply giving us the whole deal.</span>

                    <span>It is a good source to take a glimpse of the history of PC industry to year 1995. It briefly introduced how the major players like Apple, Microsoft, and IBM being involved in the PC industry.  There are a number of participants in this DVD talked about their stories. However, the introduction of those participants is too fast and I find it is hard to follow. Overall, I think it is a good documentary and quite interesting.</span>
