                <span id="Label1"><P>Let's admit it: Things will go wrong online. No matter how carefully you design a site, no matter how much testing you do, customers still encounter problems. So how do you handle these inevitable breakdowns? With defensive design. In this book, the experts at 37signals (whose clients include Microsoft, Qwest, Monster.com, and Clear Channel) will show you how. </P><P>Defensive design is like defensive driving brought to the Web. The same way drivers must always be on the lookout for slick roads, reckless drivers, and other dangerous scenarios, site builders must constantly search for trouble spots that cause visitors confusion and frustration. Good site defense can make or break the customer experience.</P><P>In these pages, you'll see hundreds of real-world examples from companies like Amazon, Google, and Yahoo that show the right (and wrong) ways to get defensive. You'll learn 40 guidelines to prevent errors and rescue customers if a breakdown occurs. You'll also explore how to evaluate your own site's defensive design and improve it over the long term. </P><P>This book is a must read for designers, programmers, copywriters, and any other site decision-makers who want to increase usability and customer satisfaction.</P></span>

                    <span>I received the book two days ago and have managed to finish it in between projects. It is the kind of book that you read and say 'well duh' I know that, but which also makes you think 'but am I doing it?'
<br />
<br />Short and easy to read. Informative and thought provoking. Would've got five stars if they had provided me some code samples to keep me from having to search for them. I will be passing it on to my colleagues.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book cites the Ticketmaster UI as a poor choice when ordering tickets to a sold-out show. The complaint is that Ticketmaster forces you to apply for tickets (and: note! pass the human authentication mechanism where you are forced to read something not easily machine-readable!) before it lets you know that none are available.
<br />
<br />The reason this process must be in place, which would occur to one after just a little thought, is so that automated processes wouldn't be set up to screen-scrape the mythical no-auth-required "tickets still available" page and automatically buy (or alert a human to buy) tickets the second they become available, giving those an unfair advantage over regular folks who would simply like a shot at a ticket or two.
<br />
<br />This book is filled with such "this is bad! this is good!" declarations and examples which are not always very well thought-out.
<br />
<br />Anyone who is smart and gives a damn about UI (and you should! I certainly do) would already know most of the things in this book.</span>

                    <span>If you are an experienced web designer, you've probably heard most of this before. You'll find as you go through this book that you are continually reminded of things you may not use daily, but you subconsciously know are right. It's a good way to take an objective look at your approach to usability, especially for errors and help; and a good pep talk for those of us who get too busy to pay attention to the basics.
<br />If you're more of a beginner, this book should be required reading. It covers lots of good info in a very easy to understand way.
<br />This book does not delve into technical details, only usability principles and ideas. It's a short, easy read and will inspire you to create more usable websites.</span>

                    <span>I've made this book compulsory reading for everyone involved in web or internal system projects.  It does not answer the questions or give a perfect example for every situation that comes along, but it does get you thinking about what would the appropriate message be for my situation based on some solid principles.
<br />
<br />I agree with some of the reviewers that it is very basic - but most people don't get the basics right!  It's entertaining and enlightening and will quickly get you on the right path to providing a better user experience.</span>

                    <span>I have to say that this book was absolutely no help to me whatsoever. On the strength of the reviews here, I purchased this book for help on a corporate redesign project two weeks ago, read it cover to cover, and set it aside in disgust. There was literally nothing in it of value. Unfortunately, as it now shows wear I cannot in good conscience return it to the store. Anyway, I don't know what the deal is with the glowing reviews - I only wish the one from "porterhouse" had been posted before I drove down to the store. That review, honestly, is the only one that's got it right.</span>
