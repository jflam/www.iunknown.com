                    <span>I have bought many photography books over the years and alot of them have been associated with marketing and finding new avenues to sell my work. This book is probably one of the best, if not THE best, I have found. This book is full of inspiring photography, sensible approaches and useful information. I would recommend this book as one of your first on your quest for better photography.</span>

                    <span>Covers many different markets and not only features the author's work and advice, but includes other published photographers as well. Answers a lot of basic questions and puts stock photography in a realistic light. You probably won't get rich and it will take several years for your photos to generate some money but Frost views stock photography more like an investment than a get-rich-quick scheme. <P>Overall, worth the money if you are thinking of getting into stock photography.</span>

                    <span>The book is fairly good, but it doesn't really give you too much fresh information that isn't already out there, other than some specific web sites to go and look at. But, if you don't already have access to that kind of information it is probably a great purchase to make.</span>

                    <span>As other reviewers before this one have already stated, this is the bible for free lance photography. It tells you what to shoot and how to market your work. It also becomes apparent as one reads this book that there is a lot of extra work, and a lot of expense, involved in this business. It's maybe 25% taking pictures with the other 75% taken up with preparation, sales and marketing, bookkeeping, etc.It involves taking thousands of pictures and keeping them on file with a picture library. There are pointers from professionals on what sells and how they work. Several, believe it or not, manage to do it while holding down a full time job elsewhere.As for expense, many shots you will have to taken with a medium format system if you hope to find a market; lots and lots of film; computer programs; labels, etc.If you're planning a career in this business, read this book first. Lee Frost will tell you exactly what you are up against.</span>

                    <span>This book was packed full of ideas for shooting marketable photos. Unlike other books I've read on this topic, this one discussed what really sells, how to sell, and didn't rpesent you with a few photos to emulate. The ideas discussed were presented in a way to help a photographer come up with their own ideas for shots, and in a manner that makes the book and it's suggestions unlikely to become outdated any time soon.</span>
