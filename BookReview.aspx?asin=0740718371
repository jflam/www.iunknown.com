                <span id="Label1">Every woman's been there and some have been there again and again!  Best-selling author Bradley Trevor Greive (BTG) understands (really, he does) the very essence of woman's age-old quest for her soul mate, the endlessly frustrating seach for "Mr. Right."  Women from all walks of life ask, "Why is a good man hard to find?"  BTG has the raw objectivity, brutal honest, and deep insight into the male psyche (after all, he is the enemy) to provide a credible answer: "Hey, maybe there aren't any!"  Bradley Trevor Greive again has combined witty, original text with superb, side-splitting photographs (retro images of people this time) to perfectly illustrate a simple but powerful message about how we choose to live our life and who we choose to share it with.  Looking For Mr. Right is one of the most hilarious, uplifting books for women ever written and makes an absolutely ideal gift for all ages.</span>

                    <span>The pictures and captions are hilarious and so true. I could not stop laughing as I flipped through the pages. I was actually laughing so hard at some of the pictures that I felt silly because I was sitting in a room all by myself laughing harder than I had in a long time. <P>This book really is not a "How to Find Mr. Right" or anything like that, it is just a cute little book that pokes fun at men. Maybe it's just the men I have known, but the book seems to be pretty true. <P>I thought the book was Extremely Funny, and I Recommend it, especially for any single girls!</span>

                    <span>The first one was funny, but this is hilarious. Most of the pictures here are very unique, like a moment frozen in time (believe me, most pictures aren't) and every one of them is cool in their own way. Most of the text is also very interesting (Unlike the "The blue day book" were most of the comments were too simple and too superficial) You definately have to get this book. It's worth both your time and money.</span>

We all are looking for "that one" what this man said was "I am the one" be true to yourelf. then you will find truth, love and Mr Right. Thanks!</span>

                    <span>The author of this book is a man, so that's the first problem, and he has the audacity to write this little book acting like he knows what women are looking for in "Mr Right." Hmmm.... Strange and fluffy book, not worth the money.</span>
