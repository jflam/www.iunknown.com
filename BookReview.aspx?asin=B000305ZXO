                <span id="Label1">If aliens came down to earth to see if humanity was worth saving,  showing them <I>Short Cuts</I>, Robert Altman's bluesy riff on life in L.A. in the '90s,  would not be a good idea. Based on the stories of Raymond Carver (adapted by Altman and Frank Barhydt), this ambitious film is a devilish  valentine to living in L.A., where happiness comes at a premium. There are at least eight separate stories that crisscross, most about people who choose not to relate to the lives they are living. Seemingly by design, none of the stories (nor the performances for that matter) have more impact than the others--this is a true mosaic film. The most representative plot deals with a group of friends (Buck Henry, Fred Ward, and Huey Lewis) who decide to keep fishing even after discovering a body in the river. The story works as a morose comedy and a flag holder for the movie: the inability to take the correct action. Others would rather talk about seeing Alex Trebek than discuss their faltering relationships. A huge and talented cast twists in the wind, bumping into moments of truth, sex, and passion. Some even come out all right in the end. The accidental nature of life--a common theme in many Altman films--has never been so maddeningly persistent, or absorbing. The score by Mark Isham with songs sung by Annie Ross (also a cast member) fuels the moodiness, as does the  opening number in which Medfly helicopters spray the town to the tune "Prisoner of Life." Delivering the film a year after his biggest hit in two decades, <I>The Player</I>, Altman proved his artistic tenacity as an aged artist with the heart of a new filmmaker: he's not afraid of risking it all. <I>--Doug Thomas</I></span>

                    <span>This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.
<br />
<br />Robert Altman's film version of "Short Cuts" based loosely on a collection of short stories by Raymond Carver is an interesting film. In the original collection of stories, each one is seperate and unrelated to each other. In this film version they are all presented together and some of the characters form the seperate stories interact with each other.
<br />
<br />Some of the events include men who find the body of a murdered woman while on a fishing trip but wait until they finish fishing to tell the police. Another is of a young boy who is hit by a car they day before his birthday. The mother had ordered a cake but the baker was insulted by someone and took his anger out on the parents, not knowing that their son was critically injured.
<br />
<br />I don't want to go into further details as it would be considered a spoiler.
<br />
<br />The film is very impressive and has some good performances by some well known actors including Tim Robbins, Robert Downey Jr., Fred Ward, Matthew Modine, Lily Tomlin, Peter Gallagher, Julianne Moore, and Jack Lemmon.
<br />
<br />In a new move by Criterion the collection of short stories is included with the DVD set in book form, through special arrangement with Vintage Books. 
<br />
<br />I found the film to be quite good despite the profanity and scene of frontal-below the-waist female nudity. I think that the film is good enough to warrant a secondary release without these scenes in it so a wider range of audiences can see it. 
<br />
<br />But given the fact that it is directed by Robert Altman, I very likely he put these scenes in the movie deliberately for the sole purpose of the film being given an R rating. Altman often does this to keep children out of the audience because he does believe children are capabale of understanding the complex plots of his films. This can present a problem as it will also keeps away many who would otherwise see the film due to nudity and cursing being offensive them.
<br />
<br />The Criterion DVD has some very nice special features also
<br />
<br />Dice one contains the film with an optional isloated music track.
<br />
<br />Disc two contains a video of a conversation between Altman and Tim Robbins, a feature length film on the production of Short Cuts, A documentary on the life of Raymond Carver which originally aired on PBS, a scene from a BBC TV series that covers the film's production, a 1 hour audio inderview with Raymond Carver from 1983, audio recordings of music from the film, deleted scenes, and look at marketing the film, including theatrical trailers.
<br />
<br />Also included is the book the film is based on.
<br />
<br />This is one that should not be missed!</span>

                    <span>Short Cuts works as a sequel to 'The Player'. Whereas 'The Player' was a scathing satire of Hollywood, Short Cuts moves only a few miles out from Tinseltown to expose the ordinary people of suburban LA.
<br />
<br />The characters in this wonderfully complex and intriguing fly on the wall drama are rich and various enough to command complete attention throughout it's considerable (3 hours) length. Altman takes great delight in toying with the viewers expectations of the characters he arrays in front of them. Take the Sex-phone operator's husband (played by Chris Penn), we are invited to sympathise with his frustrations (and secretly applaud him for his tolerance) as he accepts his wifes XXX-rated day job and even tolerates the withdrawal of sex (which bores her). When he is revealed as a far more sinister deviant at the end, the irony is astonishing. Then there is the self-centred and emotionally shallow old man (Jack Lemmon)who is callous, cold and  unfeeling towards his son (Lemmons' grandson is in intensive care in hospital after a hit and run), who is more interested in his son's famous career as a TV personality and who abandons his son at the hospital when his grandson dies rather than share his son's feelings. The many ways in which the characters in the film are horrible to each other appear partly as accidental and partly stemming from deep character flaws. 
<br />
<br />The title..'Short Cuts' is very apt, the characters each take shortcuts in their lives with usually disastrous consequences, the old geezer takes an easy short cut when he walks away from his grieving son in the hospital, the Woman driver takes one when she leaves the kid to his own devices after knocking him down, the fishermen take one when they postpone the hassle of reporting the drowned corpse, the bar singer takes one when she dismisses her...'disturbed?' daughters grief over the dead child, the violinist daughter takes many...ignoring her mothers attempts to get closer to her.... then committing suicide. I secretly applauded the scene were there is a mixup at the photo-collection booth, and two characters accidentally get the other's photos, both photos depict shocking violence but as ever nothing is as it seems, their righteous indignation over what they see as they assume the worst is such a simple commendable expression of human truth. 
<br />
<br />Altman takes a group of characters and lays bare their imperfections and shortcomings, he cleverly links their stories together in a way that recalls the theory of 'six degrees of separation' as opposed to implying a special meaning to those links. There is an ambiguity to all their deeds, nothing is really good or evil, even the brutal slaying at the end has a tone of ambiguity as we are left wondering if we actually saw correctly what we think we did.   </span>

                    <span>If you want an interpretation of Carver's stories, you may be disapointed. The film is "based" on the stories, it does not intend to follow them. 
<br />
<br />The result is a collage or mosaic without beginning or end, without either favorable or negative judgements on the lives and actions of its 22 characters.
<br />
<br />All participants do an amazing acting job. If it were only for that, this movie would be great. There is much more. You will see greatness, human good and evil, innocence, and greatness. There are human emotions portrayed like in no other movie. 
<br />
<br />If for no other reason, it's worth renting it.
<br />
<br />Jack Lemon's 9 minute monologue is so good, acted in such a masterly way, that should prompt you to buy this DVD.
<br />
<br />Criterion did a superb job with presentation and an additional DVD full of fascinating extras.</span>

                    <span>This Criterion Collection edition of Short Cuts has everything anyone could possibly want about the movie and more...much more.  Disc One contains the movie itself, which is strangely without a commentary track.  Disc Two has all the extras - eight of them.  Instead of the Director's Track, there is a new conversation with Altman and Tim Robbins, and two additional documentaries on the making of the film.  The most valuable extras are those on Raymond Carver himself: there is a PBS documentary on his life and works, and an audio interview from 1983.
<br />
<br />The most random extra included in this package is a paperback copy of the book Short Cuts, which is the collection of Carver's stories that Altman selected as the basis for the screenplay.  I was a little put-out by this as I all ready owned the book.  However, if you have not read the collection yet, I HIGHLY recommend.  It is incredibly illuminating to read the short stories and compare them to the finished product of the movie.  For one thing, it takes less time to read the book than it does to watch the movie.  This is a LONG film - three hours.  Ultimately, the film is more Altman's than Carver's.  It is ironic that Carver - the master of the tightly crafted short story - should be the springboard for such a digressive film.

                    <span>The "auteur theory", originally generated by the Fench New-Wave, is the idea that the director is THE  almost singular artist in creating the film. The director is the god, not the writer, nor the actors. He's the guy who made the film. He's the god-all-mighty for a film.
<br />
<br />Robert Altman, widely regarded as one the most important auteur in contemporary American cinema, has actually always opposed to this idea. Though he (somehow reluctantly)  admits everything goes through his own filter, in his interviews he constantly tries to minimalize his works and to give the best credits to his collaborators.
<br />
<br />With his 1993 masterpiece SHORT CUTS, Altman, who considers the film one of his favorites, nevertheless always has insisted that the film is not only his: Everything in the film comes from Raymond Carver, on whose 9 short stories the film is based on, the film's soul is Carver's. He also repeats that the cast (an impressive list that contains 22 great actors) is what made the film as it is.
<br />
<br />With this director-approved DVD edition--the first, long waited entrance of SHORT CUTS to the DVD market--, Criterion came up with a very simple solution to be faithful to the director's idea: they wraped the collection of the nine stories with the DVD in the same package.
<br />
<br />In addition, they enlarged the supplements section from their original Laser Disc edition, which already contained the making-of documentary, to introduce a wider view on the film's creation. A BBC documentary takes one of the Carver stories (the one with the cop, his wife, and the dog) and examines how it was transformed to one of the film's story. They've also put one documentary about Carver as well as an audio interview of his. Also, a glimpse on the creation of the music to which many notable musicians has contributed (U2's Bono and the Edge, Dr.John, Elvis Costello, etc) is provided with some demo-tapes of Dr.John. And to complete that, instead of just interviewing Altman, they put Altman and actor Tim Robbins (now also a fine director in his own rights) in conversation, in which Altman gladly admits the actors many contributions, like it was Robbins' idea to make Anne Archer's character a clown.
<br />
<br />With virtually all the DVD studios immitating Criterion's long-term efforts since their Laser Disc days of adding extensive supplements and audio commentaries, Criterion seems to be challenging on a new setp: not just hailing the director=the auteur, but really getting into the creative process of a film in a sober, intellectual manner. The DVD of Renoir's RULES OF THE GAMES was a fine example, and this DVD, with apparently full collaboration and blessings of Altman is another.
<br />
<br />The new Hi-Def transfer from the original, first-generation print is also beautifully done, and for SHORT CUTS, with it etxensive length of 3 hours and complex structure, not to forget that it is so rich with small details that one might miss at first viewing, the DVD format which permits us to watch the film repeatingly, is an ideal format. Robert Altman himself insists that, "if you have seen my film only once... well, you haven't really seen the movie yet. You only saw the story. I make my films so that it must be seen many time if you really like it."
<br />
<br />One mystery is that, Altman, who has always provided audio commentary for Criterion's edition, didn't record a commentary for SHORT CUTS, though it's one of his favorites. Well, he didn't with the original Laser Disc edition either. I think I now understand why he didn't: because SHORT CUTS doesn't need an audio commentary, and also probably because he cannot, since it's also Raymond Carver's film for him. Maybe he thought putting the book with the film permits more understanding than he can ever talk about.</span>
