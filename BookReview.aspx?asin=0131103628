                    <span>As many of the other reviews, I praise this book. This book claim it is not intended for novices, something many other reviewers have confirmed. But I think that is underestimating novices. From knowing very little about programming (read .bat files), I became quite fluent in C by just reading this book. It give a complete picture of the C language, ande the code examples are (imho) clear, concise and the style is good. One thing I like is that many of the examples are complete prgrams, something I found useful when trying to understand the code. This is THE resource for learning C programming. Plus, with it's good index and refernce manual, It is allso a convenient book to keep on the desk for reference. After all this bragging, here's the downside: This book is not meant for "idiots", as C programming language is not for "idiots". You need some ability to think structured and logical. Anyone who have trouble writing simple shell-scripts etc. should opt for a "for dummies" type of book. At last, please remember that this is a subjetive review, based on MY needs and MY experiences, and you may not agree with me.</span>

                    <span>This is the one and only book to have on the C programming language, written by the original developers of the language. It covers all of the syntactic and semantic issues of the language. Any question regarding C can be answered here and can be located quickly thanks its good index. I am impressed by the completeness of this text, it includes very useful information such as: precedence and associativity rules, bit-wise operators, the preprocessor, control structures, pointers, the standard C library, I/O, interaction with the UNIX operating system, and a complete language specification. The list goes on!<P> For nearly every feature of the language, there are very useful exercises that will either familiarize the reader with the feature or clarify the reader's previous knowledge. Although many of the examples are targeted towards intermediate or advanced programmers, beginning programmers should be able to get a lot out of many of the examples.<P> I have purchased many 1000+ page books on different languages including C and have found that many are incomplete and spend numerous pages on topics that can be stated in one or two paragraphs. This book in around 250 pages covers everything you need to know about the C programming language and I would highly recommend getting a copy for your own library.</span>

                    <span>Great book, not for people who nothing about programming. If you "look inside this book" (or find this book at a local bookstore) and can read the intro pages, you could see that they come right out and say that their target audience should know about variables, and other basics of programming (functions and decision making if-else, i think). I bought this book used, and apparantly the person who owned it before me did not check out the content nor what was assumed of the readers. Although it may sound kind of mean, I found it hilarious as I was flipping through the pages where he had written in things like "What's a double?", "whats this: || ?", "LOWER = 0; ?". If you're unsure whether this book is for you, click on that "look inside this book" above and try following along in the first chapter. If you get lost, get an easier book. If it's just right, then go for it.</span>

                    <span>Often refered to simply as K&R, this book is the standard by which other technical books are judged. Written by the authors of the language, it is one of those rare books that combines brevity with clarity. It is a combination of an excellent tutorial book and a clear reference manual, and it also has a very useful index. This book has it all! <P>I refer to this book all the time and so does every professional C programmer I know. It's worth every penny.<P>If you are doing Unix/Linux programming the next book to get is "Advanced Programming in the UNIX(R) Environment"<BR>by W. Richard Stevens.</span>

                    <span>This book is short and sweet. It gets straight to the point by keeping it simple(unlike many programming books that just wander off into the back woods talking about some complex programs when its trying to explain a simple syntac). I recommend this book along with C Primer Plus, then C unleashed if you wish to contiune that far down the beaten path.</span>
