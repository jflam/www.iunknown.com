                    <span>My friend and I who aer obsessed with Harry Potter decided to buy this book when we were having withdrawl symptoms. We thought it would be great read other predictions as well as seeing what other people think the books mean. Unfortuantly the book did not meet our expectations. There were many mistakes and they also wouldn't discuss what happens at the end of each book and therefore didnt' discuss the books in much depth. I think that if you are obsessed with Harry Potter like me, this book isn't for you.</span>

                    <span>I have been looking for a Harry Potter book strictly based on events in the Harry Potter series which contains ONLY facts and haven't found anything I've been interested enough in to spend my money on until now.
<br />
<br />This is an incredible Harry Potter guide.  Fionna Boyle goes into great detail about people, places, things, etc.  Not only does she list virtually everything contained in the Harry Potter series, but she goes into depth about the meanings of names, facts from J. K. Rowlings interviews, and insights you may have missed.  She does an excellent job of helping you put two and two together to get a result you may not have understood (or remembered).  I'll most likely be re-reading the Harry Potter series again (to pass away the time before The Half-Blood Prince gets here) and this guide will be right next to me for any references I need (spells, magical items, etc.).  I recommend this guide to any Harry Potter fan who wants to be as in tune with the Harry Potter world as possible!</span>

                    <span>Take the five books and make them into one book listing just about anything you can imagine(from spells to desciptions of every single person mentioned)  and you have the "Muggle's guide". I was very disappointed because there was hardly anything new. Background information seemed to be mostly quoted from the official J.K. Rowling website-which existence was the only new information I got out of the whole book.(and you can look it up there online firsthand).I was glad, I got it from the library and didn't spend any money on it.Better and more entertaining is "the magical world of Harry Potter"-where you can find good research of the meaning of latin and greek words used and connection to J.K.'s personal experience like the dementors are representing depression.</span>

                    <span>I have not even finished this book, and already I think that it is one of the better written Harry Potter "investigated" books out there.  I really enjoy this, and think that all HP fans should get the book and sit down with it.
<br />It is filled to bursting with things that I had completely forgotten.  Witches and wizards I didn't even know existed!  
<br />To sum it all up:  this is one spectacular book.</span>

                    <span>Think you know all about Harry Potter? Think again, whether you're a parent or a teen fan of the series: Fionna Boyle's examination in A Muggle's Guide To The Wizarding World quite deftly explores J. K. Rowling's entire fantasy universe, covering all the finer points of the series thus far, examining its characters, creatures and mysticism, and arranging ideas by themes that excel in trivia and gentle encouragement for the reader to think about interpretation possibilities for the series. All five books and all three movies are included in the analysis, offering debates the entire family can enjoy. A Muggle's Guide To The Wizarding World is "must" reading for all Harry Potter fans!
