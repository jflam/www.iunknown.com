                    <span>a CLIFFORD HODGE review<p>Do you remember that Firesign Theatre album: "Everything You Know is Wrong"? Once in awhile you read a book about an event in history that makes you wonder how you failed to hear about it earlier.  "Why didn't anyone ever tell me about this?" you ask yourself, trying to pull something from the recesses of your memory to bridge the gap and harmonize the cognitive dissonance you feel, having learned that the world is a stranger place than you had suspected.<p>In the '60's we associated "race riot" with violence and unrest in the black community, images of blacks breaking windows, setting fires, throwing rocks, etc.  Well, yes, Virginia, it's true, there was a time when "race riot" not only did not refer to violent behavior by blacks, but it referred to a series of events which involved, as The Clash might say: "White Riot", the white majority running amok, burning down houses, looting, killing innocent blacks, and, what seems most significant, destroying signs of black economic achievement (spell that i-n-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-c-e ) and social advancement.<p>    A stack of books which have come out in the last 3 or 4 years can help you patch the holes in your education, books dealing with early 20th-century riots in places like Tulsa, Florida, and New Orleans.  What is perhaps most disturbing about the revelations in these books is the fact that the violence is carried out not only in full view of the local autorities, but with the cooperation and assistance of local and even national government.  Talk about being up against it!  Why are these important?  Isn't this just mean-spirited muckraking?  No.  They raise questions relevant to a current legal issue, namely the payment of reparations to blacks.  The first-hand accounts provided by Madigan vividly establish the severity and duration of the damages suffered by the victims - only a handful of whom survived at the time of publication - at the hands of the whites - whose surviving numbers are never known, since the participants have tended not to reveal themselves for obvious reasons.  It raises questions about whether, for insurance purposes, the events should have been defined, not as a riot, but as a government action or an act of war, an invasion by a hostile army.  Indeed, Greenwood resembled a war zone in some respects; read the book if you don't believe me.<p>Accounts differ between this and other books regarding how the events in front of the courthouse that evening of May 31, 1921 evolved into the conflagration that turned several city blocks of houses into smoking empty lots.   The apparent turning point was a confrontation between a black WWI veteran who owned a grocery and an elderly white man who apparently was not too clear-headed, and acted as though he was living in pre-war (Civil, that is) days.  Within a matter of seconds, scores of shots were fired, everyone hit the ground, then ran to his own side of town to re-arm, re-load, and reconnoiter.<p>Those couple seconds after the flurry of shots, when it became silent again, and everyone looked around at the dead and wounded, suddenly realizing that something big had happened, something bigger might (or might not?) happen, constitute one of the most dramatic event descriptions I've ever read in a history book.  It calls to mind Ken Burns talking about making a recording of Lincoln at Ford's Theatre, and telling about editing the sound, coming to the very moment before Lincoln is shot, and stopping the tape. Everyone in the editing room sat looking at each other, thinking about the tremendous import of that brief moment, that pause as time gets ready to draw another breath, when things could go one way or the other, and that makes all the difference.<p>    I can imagine being on that courthouse square with the 500 or so people just at that moment when the shooting stops, smoke hovering all around, and they all look at each other, frightened, suspicious: "Can we just walk away?"  Each wonders what will happen next...  And being human, they dread.  Everyone runs for a gun, a knife, a club.  They all pile into cars and head off to organize an army.  The two sides have now engaged, battle lines been drawn, and all without anyone saying anything.  That's history.  What will you do if you're there next time?  That's why we read history.</span>

                    <span>In 1921, one of the most successful black communities in the U.S. was completely destroyed by white mobs.  The triggering event was a bogus accusation of assault by a white girl of questionable character against a young black man named Dick Rowland.  Hundreds were killed and the landscape of Tulsa remade forever in an event that made headlines across the country, then disappeared from American consciousness until very recently.  In 'The Burning,' Texas newspaper reporter Tim Madigan explores the worst race riot in America's history with both a reporter's love of detail and a writer's love of legitimate human drama.<p>'The Burning' almost can't help but be gripping--the subject matter is naturally captivating, and Madigan does an excellent job of placing you THERE time and time again through the eyes of various participants, both black and white.  It's a very complete account, and Madigan finds a nice balance between being well-researched and all historical-ish and filling in color or details in his narrative to keep the story alive.  While there are a few heroes and villains, Madigan avoids painting his characters in bold 'good guy' / 'bad guy' stereotypes.  The reader is left not simply reviling white supremacists and feeling morally superior to past generations, but questioning the dark side of our humanity and hating ignorance and self-righteousness, whatever their specifics. <p>The book begins a little off-kilter as he sets up various approaches and backgrounds to the events to come, and I wonder if he didn't write various sections here and later in the work at different times, then simply paste them together without necessarily working them into a single consistent flow.  It is at times briefly disorienting.  And while the compilation of SO many first-hand experiences by different people is wonderful in terms of completeness, it occasionally feels like overkill.  If this were a work of fiction, such thoroughness would be wallowing.  Being as it's history, and a piece of history not yet often written about in detail, this is easily forgiven.  As commented on by previous reviewers, the informal way Madigan cites sources at the end of the book is troubling, but hardly qualifies of evidence of his placing emotion over substance.  <p>Overall, a must-read for anyone interested in Oklahoma (both of you), race relations or civil rights, sociology, or American history.  While the nature of the event leaves some of Madigan's details open to future challenge, his painting of this horrific episode will not easily be forgotten.</span>

                    <span>On June 1, 1921, the white citizenry of Tulsa leveled by fire one of the most successful black business and residential districts in the U. S.  In the process of doing so, one to three hundred people, mostly black, were killed, and several thousand blacks, then possessing only the clothes on their backs, were forcibly marched to makeshift detention camps.  <br> <br>This book places the blame for the riot on rampant racism and a Tulsa newspaper publisher (Richard Lloyd Jones of the Tulsa Tribune), whose "to lynch Negro" editorial on May 31 remains missing to this day.  The Negro in question was a black male who had been taken into custody for assaulting a white female. The assault charge was subsequently dropped.<p>One of the more memorable of many events in the book is the grisly murder of a blind elderly black man, who had only stumps for legs.  He used old catcher mitts on his hands to propel himself from place to place on a wheeled platform and supported himself by selling pencils and singing songs on downtown Tulsa streets.  <p>At around 8:00 A.M. on June 1, he was apprehended by a group of three or four whites, who tied one end of a rope to the longer of his two leg stumps and the other end to the rear bumper of their car.  The old man's pleas for mercy followed by cries of pain as he bounced to and fro on the harsh bricks and steel rails of Main Street were to no avail. <p>Not one to be inconsistent, the Tulsa Tribune endorsed the riot--saying the blacks got what was coming to them ("the angry white man's reprisal for the wrong inflicted on them by the inferior race") and offering no apology to the police commissioner or mayor "for having pled with them to clean up the cesspools," otherwise referred to by the newspaper as "Niggertown."<p>The city fathers did little to help the blacks rebuild their homes and businesses and refused offers of help coming from outside Tulsa.  Something like one-thousand blacks spent the winter of 1921-22 living in tents provided by the Red Cross.  A number of blacks, not surprisingly, left Tulsa for good.<p>As mentioned by a previous reviewer, a map of (old) Tulsa would have been nice as an aid to the reader in tracing the mob's movement from one end of Greenwood (the black district) to the other.  <p>In the author's note prior to the prologue, the author states he has "taken the license of approximating dialogue for the purpose of maintaining the narrative."   Although this aspect is a bit of downer, a reader without access to official records would be hard-pressed to separate the envisioned dialogue from the actual.  Regardless, the central message in this book is clear, consistent, and relevant.</span>

                    <span>Tim Madigan's lively, vivid and long over-due account of the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 is a journalistic treasure. As one who originally hailed from Kansas and had been in and out of Tulsa twice a year since 1947, I was certainly familiar with the Oil Capitol; thus, Madigan's book spoke to me from the book rack. However, I found myself frustrated by the lack of a map of the Greenwood area. I actually had to buy a map of Tulsa and sit down with underlined passages in order to recreate exactly where Greenwood was. This is not the author's fault but it certainly is the fault of his editor at Thomas Dunne Books. (Too be honest, other books about the same subject also see maps as expendible). In any case you can smell the smoke in Madigan's account and you get a viseral reaction to the whole sad scene. The book is tangible proof that Ben Jonson was correct when he said that "Sunlight is the best solvent."</span>

                    <span>I frankly had never heard of the awful race riot in Tulsa on May 31 and June 1, 1921.  This account is slipshoddily written by a journalist, not by a historian.  The book has no footnotes and no real bibliography.  So much of the account is devoted to guessing and while the book is rightly sympathetic to the black victims the account often lapses into juvenilistic maudlin journalism.  The story is important, the event is full of horrific atrocities by white people, but the telling is not done well.  Instead of expatiating on how awful things were I would far rather the author had laid out the facts, complete with footnotes.  ...I simply have no faith that this account is objective and accurate.  Sorry.  I see there are other books dealing with the event...</span>
