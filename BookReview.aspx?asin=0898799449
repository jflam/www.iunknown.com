                <span id="Label1">Photography is in the midst of a revolution. Rohn Engh shows part-time and professional photographers how to compete with the big agencies by using the Internet--the new frontier of stock photography sales--and by determining how their images, both traditional and digital, are delivered and paid for. A comprehensive guide, <I>sellphotos.com</I> covers everything for photographers from Internet basics and the nature of the stock photography trade to building their own web sites and operating their own business.</span>

                    <span>If you've read Rohn Engh's previous book titled Sell and Re-Sell Your Photos, then you might want to skip SellPhotos.com. Approximately half of the information is straight out of Sell and Re-Sell Your Photos.<P>That said, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the stock photography business. It covers a variety of business-oriented topics, such as forms, letters, pricing, marketing, legal issues, etc. The author's words are very encouraging--by the time you're done with this book, you will feel confident enough to run a successful stock photography business.<P>As for "Establishing a Successful Stock Photography Business on the Internet," this book falls short. This book was published in January 2000, when the internet was still very much the wild west. The internet, as well as technology in general, has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, making some of the information in this book obsolete.<P>If you don't mind weeding out the obsolete information, then I recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>The book was decent and informative but out of date.It does give you a good idea about using the internet and setting up a web site to help sell your photos in the marketplace.<BR>It was published in 2000. It refers to using windows 95 & 98 and modems with 2800 baud. It is out of date, he needs to update the book.<BR>I paid a discount price of 13.99 for it but it should be selling for less.<BR>I read his other book "How to sell and resell your photos" which was a very good book for photographers thinking of going into stock photography.<BR>It would be nice to see an update with the newer XP operating system and newer software programs and web sites listed.</span>
