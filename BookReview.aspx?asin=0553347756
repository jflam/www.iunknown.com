                    <span>This is the follow up volume to the excellent Writing Down the Bones. If you have read the first book, and still feel blocked, then this book could prove very useful. What I feel is that she covered most of the important aspects of being an aspiring writer in 'Bones, so I feel their is some rehash, and some material that is just not as good as 'Bones.
<br />Still, she builds more on both zen and jewish wisdom, and it does not do anyone any harm to read it. 
<br />Of course, this book helped me to appreciate haiku, and that counts for something!</span>

                    <span>This book is yet another treasure from Natalie Goldberg.  It is like being invited into her home for a while, observing her in process... gleaning what gold you can.  <p>Sipping tea, doing writing practice, laughing at her jokes and I imagine telling a couple of your own once you win her favor.  <p>I have incorporated several of the "Try This On" exercises into my own writing practice and have been delighted at the result.  It seems as if each "Try This On" yields some benefit, usually beyond what I expect.  <p>My only wish is that I discovered Natalie Goldberg's writing sooner.  This is a delicious, filling offering.... Perfect for using after "Writing Down the Bones."</span>

                    <span>After reading it twice, I think this book contains both positive and negative aspects. Basically, I've come to the conclusion that it's not a book on how to write. Instead, I view it as a memoir by a person with a more-or-less interesting life. At times, it makes for fascinating reading; other times, the stories and anecdotes fall really flat. The writing advice itself is sparse though there are several decent exercises to cure writers' block. Goldberg is a remarkable writer who has wisdom and wit, but I expected more actual writing *technique* from this book and was therefore disappointed. <p>By the way, I pity the narrow-minded reviewers who bash her for writing about her relationships with women. I've read plenty of books by heterosexual authors who constantly mention their spouses, and I don't see readers accusing them of throwing it in their faces.</span>
