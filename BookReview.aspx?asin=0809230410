                <span id="Label1">Coach Wooden's remarkable 10 national basketball championships in 12 years at UCLA speak for themselves. In <i>Wooden</i>, the coach--quiet, thoughtful, and introspective throughout his distinguished career--finally speaks for<i>himself</i>, and he's well worth hearing. <i>Wooden</i> is a modern chapbook of inspiration and good sense that reveals the hard-court philosopher behind it as a man of character, conviction, decency, and straightforwardness. There are no complex ideas, just little beams of light filtered through anecdotes that project the kinds of simple, immutable truths that in the end touch nothing but net.  </span>

                    <span>This book is a must read for every parent, teacher, and coach.  AND it should be a must read for every high school student and athlete.  This should be at the top of every high school English teacher's required reading list for their students. It would certainly provide far more benefit than some of the "classics" they are now required to read.  If more kids read this book at an early age, it would help them understand many values in life that unfortunately many don't discover until much later in life, if at all. Mr. Wooden writes in such an easy to understand and concise manner that kids will find it very easy but yet very powerful reading.  It wasn't written specifically for kids, but they can certainly benefit the most before they get too set in their ways.</span>

                    <span>This short, easy to read, throughouly accessible volume is but a brief distillation and synthesis of over 50 years of teaching, coaching and life long learning. Mr. John Wooden is so much more than an extremely successful basketball coach. He is a philosopher, mentor and fellow traveller. This brief collection offers a treasure trove of daily inspirational messages and guidance for all people who long to achieve ultimate success in any walk of life. 
<br />
<br />Wooden teaches many lessons, but two that stand out are:
<br />
<br />1) Love is not a feeling, but rather a full-time job. (Wooden doesn't say this blatantly. This is the message that rings through every sentence.)
<br />
<br />2) Ultimately winning is not measured in scores or trophies but rather personal satisfaction in committing to task with all of one's abilities.
<br />
<br />A must read for all.</span>

                    <span>John was truly a team player no matter what his tasks was.  He taught many to understand others, but also understand actions in every different situation.Wooden shares his personal philosophy on family, achievement, success, and excellence on every aspect of life.  John shares his teachings to others and guides them with wisdom far beyond sports.  This book written by John Wooden himself with Steve Jamison will pull you in, as  you read a lifetime of observations and refelctions on and off the court, and how great his success was at U.C.L.A as a basket ball coach.<br>	I mostly enjoyed the man's passion for being a better person in life, but also teaching others.  He was a man of integrity with great knowledge and wisdom, he created success.  What I like most about the book is that in a way to read about John, it is also a learning experience, because you are still learning about his teachings. I most respect on how John took lessons taught as a child from his parents and continued to take them with him in life.  I also like how he had a pyramid of success faith and patience were at the top.  He was a man of his word, but also the "word," that being the bible.<br>	I do not dislike anything about this book, because there are many different teachings to value.  It makes you want to learn more from life everday and how you can make your work that much better.  His benevolence is proudly displayed in all aspects of life, but most importantly he also learned from his players as he coached them everday.  This shows that not everyone is here to teach, but many are here to listen.  As Wooden did so, he lived his life with wisdom, success, and leading to your capabilities</span>

                    <span>This is the kind of book I'll go back to again and again.  I got it after finding out about Wooden's "Pyramid of Success" from his website ...  I think what I got out of it mostly was the value of being as prepared as possible (for whatever's coming up, short and long-term), and of being industrious... but the latter is a lesson *I* need to learn right now, and others might pick up something else... their particular weakness right now.<p>So I would recommend it as a valuable "life manual," right alongside books like 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The Power of Positive Thinking, and Think and Grow Rich.</span>

                    <span>In my business reading this year, I find myself "flying through" the standard business fare, finding the important points and moving on.  Very many business books are written that way.  Although "Wooden" is not a business book, I expect a lot of the business crowd will be attracted to the book - John Wooden is mentioned in so many other books about leadership and teamwork.  When I began reading this book - dare I say treasure - I realized that my brain began recalibrating to a much slower reading speed, because the content is so fresh, so pithy, and so engaging.  I felt as though I was sitting in a room with this great man, listening to him talk about life and basketball.  I sensed his delicate and understated humor, his love of poetry, his clarity of priorities and purpose, and found myself wrapped up in the text.  This is a book that you will want to read slowly, and read again from time to time.</span>
