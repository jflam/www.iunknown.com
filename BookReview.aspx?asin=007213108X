                    <span>READER FROM CHICAGO, IL .."for beginners only"<br>hey man, it states on the cover of this book that it's a beginner's book, so why you complaining?  lol  <br>it's your carelessness in not checking enough b4 buying the book that made you buy it.  It maybe a one star or 2 star book if it claimed that it was an advance level book, but it doesn't state that, does it?  =)<p>This is the best beginner-intermediate level book on DW(yes, in comparison to DW Visual Quickstart, or any other book for this level).  PERIOD.</span>

                    <span>What a wonderful introduction to Dreamweaver. So wonderful that I use it as one of my texts in my Web design and Introduction to Dreamweaver courses that I teach. The CD that accompanies the book is a bit of a tease. But, for the visual learner will have you building Web pages in no time.</span>

                    <span>I was quite disappointed at the amount coverage of the Dreamweaver 4 functionality provided on the CD.<br>Most topics were presented very minimally and some topics were not covered at all (ie Cascading Style Sheets). <br>I think it is very unfair to charge an additional $30, to get the "Extra" CD. The information/topics covered by the "Extra" CD should be included at no charge and be part of the CD accompanying the book.  If you are looking for more technical desciption of Dreamweaver 4 functionality, this is not the book/CD to help you.</span>

                    <span>I am looking to further enhance my own web page and was trying to find a book or software that was easy to follow and understand while giving me the tools, tips and tricks I needed to make the changes. I am sure glad I found this book and cd; it was exactly what I was looking for.<p> <p>The book has 350 pages and I think there could have been 350 more. Packed with helpful information from the very start, this combination makes learning Dreamweaver a real breeze.<p> <p>From planning the site, working with text, images, links and tables to forms, frames, layers, CSS and multimedia, you can learn at your own pace and make sure you understand the concept before moving on the next area.<p> <p>Also include are topics like java scripting, Dreamweaver power tools, working with FireWorks. The author has taken a great deal of time and effort to create one of the best step by step layouts of teaching I have ever seen. With the cd included it like having the instructor right at your side.</span>

                    <span>This is a great series and it's about time instuction took this kind of level to task.  The "personal instructor" video approach works great for me and it allowed me to use Dreamweaver 4 immediately without the usual intimidation one feels with a new program. I got very comfortable with the instruction and was able to get to work with the program (Dreamweaver 4) extremely fast. The Brainsville video format is very cool. Thanks again for exploring this avenue of instructor-based video-CD books and I hope you have plans for many future software releases. The software companies should thank you for helping others use their complex programs that often intimidate us.</span>
