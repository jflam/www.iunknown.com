                    <span>Aces is a great insight into the minds of three very good pitchers who have different personalities.  Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito are known as the Big Three, three fantastic young pitchers on the Oakland A's staff.  This book, by a daily newspaper beat writer, covers the three pitchers through the season.  Although its about the A's, and Billy Beane wrote the foreward, its not like the famous book by Michael Lewis, Moneyball, at all. There's little in it about Beane's approach to baseball, except how the Big 3 feel about the A's lack of spending money.  They aren't happy about not bringing in free agent talent due to their limited funds.  The book goes through the mental aspects of the game, how Mulder and Zito both dealt with failure at different points in the season.  Mulder had a great start but faltered in the 2nd half of the season, while Zito had a bad start but pitched well in the latter part of the season.  After reading this book, its hard not to root for these three pitchers, even though they pitch for three different teams now.  Urban did a great job. </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book was a delight to read as I love to see inside the world of the players, and Urban does it with a breezy and fun style that is worth reading out loud (as I often did to my boyfriend, or whoever was nearby if they knew about baseball). The "big three" in Mulder, Hudson and Zito provide a study in contrasts that illuminates everything from what goes on inside a pitcher's head (or doesn't) while he's on the mound, to the importance of pitching coaches. I found myself wanting to copy out various sentences from the book to make sig quotes out of, sometimes from what the players said, sometimes from Urban's pithy and hip take on modern major league life. 
<br />
<br />The book's only possible drawback is that I wanted more! There are some great personal moments (that also give insight into baseball), as with Zito using his guitar case as an illustration of Gary Sheffield's 'hitting zone', but I wanted more of them. The book was designed to cover just one season, but honestly I could have used a little bit less of a chronicle of the A's ups and downs in a season that wasn't that memorable and more of the pitchers talking pitching. Perhaps Urban will write another book that will satisfy me on that score later--I would buy it in a second. He's definitely one of the up an coming baseball scribes worth watching.</span>

                    <span>Urban's look inside the Big Three is well done and entertaining, even for the non-baseball junkie. If you're looking for more detailed insight on how a splitter is thrown, you may want to buy Tom Emmanski's videos, but if you want to know what's inside the heads of these guys while on the mound and in the dugout, as well as what it's truly like to be a big leaguer, look no further. He takes the reader through the flow of the season, but doesn't bog them down with the details of every game, all while explaining the emotions, relationships and interactions that happen on the team bus, in the clubhouse and at the watering holes where these guys hang out. </span>

                    <span>i've never been much of a fan of the a's--beyond having some of them on my fantasy teams--but i am interested in pitching, so i found myself tasting it via the search function.  it got to the point that i was so engrossed, that i had to buy it.  it's an interesting story that lets you better understand the the strategy of pitching, as well as lets you understand that characters of pitchers.  i've recommended it to my friends, too.</span>

                    <span>Tony Huang's review is as far off base as Eric Byrnes was when attempting to score in the 2003 ALDS. In fact, his review chafes me so much that I feel like I need to do Amazon customers justice by standing up for an outstanding piece of baseball literature. I've read every one of Mychael Urban's articles on MLB.com the last four years, so I have the credibility to say that "Aces" doesn't read anything like what Huang calls a "string of daily recaps." The book flows smoothly and the quotes from Hudson, Mulder and Zito are extremely insightful. I've read some great baseball books in the past, including Roger Kahn's "Boys of Summer" and David Halberstam's "The Teammates," but I've never learned so much about the game of baseball than I have from Urban's book. Urban's reporting gives us fans an inside look at what goes on inside a pitcher's head when he toes the rubber. When reading Aces, I felt as if I was sharing the mental problems Barry and Mark were experiencing throughout the 2004 season. This book brought me closer to the playing field, just as all great sports works should. Pick up a copy of Aces. It's worth every word.</span>
