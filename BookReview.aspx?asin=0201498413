                    <span>I have been a C and C++ programmer for 5 years, and is regarded as an professional C and C++ programmer. After scanning this book, I think I should re-estimate my C skill.<p>In one word, this book is the most advanced C book I've read, it presents lots of wonderful techniques and ideas, and more, all the things are very useful. For examples:<p>* Use standard C's setjmp/longjmp to implement WIn32 SEH-like exception handling machanism.<p>* Very detailed and smart memory management solution.<p>* All the data structures and utilities in well-defined, reusable format: atoms, tables, sets, vectors(dynamic arrays), rings, strings, arithmetric with any precisions, thread library... everything you need to build a whole new system.<p>I'd say that once you master each of those things (this means read and re-read until understanding occur, as Fransis Glassborow said ), you will be an outstanding programmer in any circumstance, and can be full of confidence to accept any programming challenge.<p>The only thing I complain is about the source code. The source code presenting style in this book is relative strange and difficult to catch. I tried to type the code into my PC, and found it's a unpleasent work. Fortunately, the all source can be download from the book's web page, so, I still gave 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>I have just finished reading the first six chapter of this book and find it very instructive.<br>As a programmer, I followed the way of C->C++->Java in the past three years. Now as I am coming back to C£¬ I find this book helps me to finish a cycle in software engineering. <br>When I am reading, I imagine how every idea introduced here can help to implement those "OOP" features of Java and C++. It reveals to me the very essence of software itself.<br>Originally I plan to buy it by company money, but now I changed the idea to pay by myself because I really want to keep it.</span>

                    <span>If you want to become a professional programmer overnight.read and thoroughly understand this book. If one could master the techniques described in this book..he may never have to worry about failing software developer's job interviews. This last statement is based on my personal experience. <br>The chapters provide source code which is clear, efficient, and outrightly professional, the description is concise, to the point and clear enough.Most of the code in the book can be used without any modification. I don't know of a book in the market that could teach how to design and implement a user-level threads library from the scratch WITHOUT any help from the Operating System. Simply wonderful</span>

                    <span>Clearly written and well organized, this book presents more than 20 _highly_ useful library interfaces for containers, string management,  mathematics, and memory management. There isn't a line of code in the whole  book that you couldn't take and use, verbatim, in a project today --- after  reading this book, you'll probably never  have a compelling reason to write  a string library or a hash table interface again.<p>More importantly,  though, each example library  illustrates ways to effectively design  consistant and useable library interfaces, from generic ADTs to system  service wrappers. After reading this  book, you'll not only have an arsenal  of useful code to leverage, but also a good understanding  of how to design  clean, modular, reuseable  components for your application.<p>Hanson's C  code is extremely clear and concise. Even if you've been programming  professionally for a long time, you are likely to pick up a useful  technique or two just by reading the source code in the book. If you're not  very experienced, you will learn about C programming idioms that will  be  valuable to you in future work.<p>I really like how this book, and Hanson's  other book ("A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and  Implementation") are put together. Hanson employs Literate Programming  techniques to weave the code he's discussing together with his discussion.   This makes it very simple to track what portions of the code are being  talked about at any point<p>in the book.</span>
