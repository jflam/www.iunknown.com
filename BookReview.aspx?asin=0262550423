                <span id="Label1">Since the end of World War II, economists have tried to figure out how poor countries in the tropics could attain standards of living approaching those of countries in Europe and North America. Attempted remedies have included providing foreign aid, investing in machines, fostering education, controlling population growth, and making aid loans as well as forgiving those loans on condition of reforms. None of these solutions has delivered as promised. The problem is not the failure of economics, William Easterly argues, but the failure to apply economic principles to practical policy work.<br /> <br /> In this book Easterly shows how these solutions all violate the basic principle of economics, that people--private individuals and businesses, government officials, even aid donors--respond to incentives. Easterly first discusses the importance of growth. He then analyzes the development solutions that have failed. Finally, he suggests alternative approaches to the problem. Written in an accessible, at times irreverent, style, Easterlys book combines modern growth theory with anecdotes from his fieldwork for the World Bank.</span>

                    <span>For 5/6ths of the people of Earth, life is a daily struggle for basic needs: food, shelter, medicine. Infant mortality rates are high, women are oppressed, and individuals have limited opportunities to improve their lot. <P>William Easterly is a Senior Advisor in the Development Research Group of the World Bank. In his first book, he asks why trillion dollars of foreign aid to the countries of the "third world" since WWII have caused essentially no improvement in the quality of life for the people in these countries. I found the writing lucid and the many real stories of poverty and corruption both emotionally powerful and insightful. <P>Emphasizing a key mantra of economics -- people respond to incentives -- he details the long list of foreign aid tactics that have failed: capital investment (machines, factories, roads), education, birth control, loans, and loan forgiveness. Not that any of the tactics are bad, but rather they are ineffectual in a country lacking key social, political, and economic infrastructure. <P>Easterly then describes in detail the factors at play in driving growth: increasing returns (Leaks, Matches, Traps), creative destruction through technology, luck, governments kill growth, government corruption, and class and race conflicts. <P>Easterly shows that achieving economic growth is very difficult, but he does a great job of identifying the key systemic issues that poor countries must address. <P>Perhaps surprisingly, Easterly's model applies equally well to the economic disparities that exist within countries, even "rich" countries like the United States. The increasing returns model says that highly-skilled people will prefer to live and work with one another ("Matches"), as each of them will be more productive for being around other highly-skilled individuals. So this explains, for example, why areas like Silicon Valley, having once achieved critical mass, continue to grow. And why low-income inner-city and rural areas remain depressed ("Traps").</span>

                    <span>An economist at the World Bank, Easterly looks back at the dismal economic record of the Third World over the last 40 years and distills lesssons to guide donors and policymakers in the future. He is at his best when dissecting failed policies such as population control or structural adjustment loans, which were embraced by development experts of the day but rested on faulty logic and flopped in practice. The rest of his book contains fascinating, nuanced discussions of how bad governance, "poverty traps," and plain bad luck (such as terms of trade shocks) can keep poor countries trapped in vicious cycles of poverty. Many myths are exploded, such as the belief that poor nations are destined to "catch up" with rich ones, or that international investment flows to capital-poor states in an effort to find higher returns. The text is clearly written and filled with wry humor. However, the failure to discuss how "Asian Tigers" such as Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan broke out of poverty and achieved industrial take off -- at one point, Easterly half-seriously cites "good luck" as a key explanation for their 30-year record of sustained economic growth! -- is a glaring hole and results in my rating of only four stars.</span>

                    <span>While Easterly's book may seem targeted for economists, it's actually a book for everybody - it's needed to debunk myths that continue to prevail in policymaking. It's important that we understand what doesn't work and through a process of elimination of cure alls, we might eventually come to a solution. <P>As for one of the reviewer's question about why Easterly attributes a lot of the East Asian Miracle to "luck"... well, being an East Asian, we don't want to admit it. It's a lot about factor accumulation or basically saving really hard for a rainy day. But there's been low productivity from technology change and all this rampant growth has tapered off. So in a sense we are "lucky" that we could save like crazy under favorable world economic conditions then... But we came undone through too much suspicious government meddling, corruption, cronyism and thinking that we were invincible.</span>

                    <span>Easterly does indeed cover the history of economic development, and he magically creates the image of poor people who just never had the right incentives. I will not argue with his historical accuracy, this part of his book is straightforward enough. Indeed, any competent historian could have related an equivalent story. However, where Easterly falls short of his title of being an economist is in that of what to do next. People need the right incentives... ok what now. Martin Feldstien gave us his theory, Robert Solow threw his hat in the ring, and as such they are economists, however all Easterly is is an economic historian offering very little advice as to what is next.</span>

                    <span>I found this book enjoyable reading. It uses many standard economic ideas, but does not assume the reader knows them and it explains them clearly and simply. For instance, his description of the "Luddite Fallacy" is one of the best I have seen.<P>The subject that economists study, human interaction, is too complex to be a solved problem. Over the years there have been guesses that have not worked out. The theme of this book is based on the idea that people are entrepreneurial. If the developed world gives the less developed world a whole pile of money, then the entrepreneurial thing to do is to try and get some of it. Unfortunately, that will not necessarily be the use of the money that is best for the long term growth of the country.<P>There are a number of well meaning actions that the developing world has taken that have had unintended consequences and Easterly gives great examples of them. The question he asks and what he proposes is: what actions will incentivise people to do the things that will result in the best long term results?<P>Sometimes that might require toughlove, and as such may not be politically appealing, but it makes sense, as William Easterly so clearly shows in this readable and significant book.</span>
