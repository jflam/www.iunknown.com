                    <span>I have been a history buff for years, and there are lots of great history questions here, but I also enjoyed the material about pop culture and food. Guess I knew more about pop music and movies than I did about the presidents! There is something here for everybody including kids. I really liked the final section, 20 questions about each oft he 50 states.</span>

                    <span>OK, so we're all in a patriotic mood now, and why not? America has a lot to celebrate, and this book is all about every aspect of American culture and history. I found this book in my doctor's waiting room and liked it so much I bought it myself. Everything is here--history, TV, movies, pop music, food, trends, politics, especially the US presidents, lots more. I like the format of having the answers on the backs of the question pages. It's good clean fun, and we've enjoyed it with the family.</span>

                    <span>Our family has enjoyed this a lot, since we take a lot of trips in our RV. Great way to entertain on the road. We really liked the questions about pop music and movies, also some great questions about the US presidents. Very entertaining, clever.</span>

                    <span>This book has a lot of trivia questions. And that's one of the reasons why it isn't a great book. With 3,000 questions, one has to strain to find the interesting ones. A much better bet is the book titled "Quizzing" which I found had interesting answers to almost all the questions it carried.</span>
