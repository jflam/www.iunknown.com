                <span id="Label1">Most Americans remember the Whigs as morally uptight New Englanders who provided us with some of our more mediocre presidents. In his exhaustively researched book <I>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</I>,  Michael F. Holt partially rehabilitates the reputation of this once-thriving political party. Founded in 1833, following Andrew Jackson's decimation of the Second Bank of the United States, the Whigs were united in the belief that the federal government was obligated to sponsor the nation's internal development and to promote manufacturing and large-scale agricultural endeavors. In Holt's account, however, proponents of Whiggery were divided on numerous other issues.<p>  The nature of these disagreements amongst party leaders (most notably Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and future presidents such as John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Millard Fillmore) take up the majority of space in Holt's 1,200-page account. Instead of relating how general sentiment on major issues (such as territorial expansion and the Compromise of 1850) determined the Whigs' fate, Holt shows how local and statewide political caucuses, party "kingmakers," federal patronage, and special interests created competing factions within the party even before sectionalism fractured cooperation between Northern and Southern wings in 1854. Amidst the diffused levels of power that defined the Federalism of the post-Jacksonian era, Holt concludes that the more popular leaders (such as Taylor and Fillmore) tried to balance competition amongst party factions instead of imposing an ideological "hard line" on sectional issues, a move that alienated many of the party's key ideological supporters. Written in an engaging narrative style with a minimal engagement of abstract theory, <I>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</I> meticulously reconstructs the byzantine world of 19th-century American politics. <I>--John M. Anderson</I></span>

                    <span>In the Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party, Professor Holt convicingly demonstrates through detailed inspection and analysis of national, state and local elections that the Whigs were always a deeply divided political party whose continued existance as a potent political force was always reliant upon their fervent opposition to the Democratic Party and its policies.  For this reason, since Whig success or failure at the polls was always dependent upon Demoratic actions as opposed to those of the Whigs themselves, the Whigs were always at the mercy of their political opponents.  Therefore, when tangable differences between the two parties began to deteriorate in the early 1850's, the long exisiting and deep divisions among the Whig rank and file allowed for crippling defections to both the enigmatic American and fledgling Republican parties.  Thus, the Second Party System came to an abrupt, and for the country, a calamitous end.</span>

                    <span>This is a great reference on Antebellum politics in America in those formative years of sectionalism leading up to the war between the states. It picks up with the start of the Jacksonian era in the mid-1820's when the Federalist Party is no more. It is a rather thorough piece of scholarship, which some criticize for being overtly technical (e.g. election statistics.) Its value as a reference is not to be underestimated for those interested in 19th century American History. However, the bulk of the book is a well-researched reference into Whig Party politics, which itself was beset by sectionalist factions.<p>I also recommend State's Rights and the Union by Forrest McDonald.</span>

                    <span>There is much, much more to "The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party" than the sections that cover Millard Fillmore.  I only cite him as an example of how this excellent work fills holes that had long existed in historical writings on this era.  While there are biographies of Fillmore, no work likely to be of more general interest has dealt adequately with his administration.  Even works like "The Ordeal of the Union" have rather little to say about this important, enigmatic figure in antebellum politics.  Holt's work completely redresses this lack, as it does for many other figures in the Whig party.  In addition, its analysis of the interaction of politics at the national and state levels (and occasionally the local and purely personal levels) should serve as an example for all future work on American political history.  The more technical material - mostly focusing on election results - should not be too much of a problem.  After the first time or two of wading through these sections of limited interest to the non-specialist, you develop a knack for knowing where to skim and where to pay close attention.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the political events preceding the Civil War.</span>

                    <span>It can clearly be said that Michael Holt's book "The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party" is the last word on the subject.  This exhaustive, deeply analytical, and immensely detailed work is the ultimate history of the American Whig party.  Yet, it is much more than that: as William Gienapp has written, it is "one of the most important books on nineteenth-century politics ever written."  Yes, it is somewhat dry at times and often repetitious.  Yes, there are many charts and statistics, and as one Amazon reviewer suggested, these are best ignored.  This book is certainly not a quick read and you had better be in love with political history before tackling it.  But, the rewards for the patient reader are immense.  You will come away from this experience with an understanding of American politics you can gain nowhere else.  <p>The deeply learned Holt ties political history to the changing social, religious, economic, and cultural life of nineteenth-century America and exposes the ethnic conflicts in American life and how they influenced the fortunes of the Whig and Democratic parties.  His persistent theme is that the origins and successes of the Whig party depended upon the state of its rivalry with the Democratic party, and once the issues that separated the two parties lost their urgency, the Whig party lost much of its support and its reason for being.  A secondary theme is that "politics is local" and that we cannot understand the history of the Whig or the Democratic party without understanding the local and state issues that shaped their rivalry.  Real politicians dealing with real local and regional issues and fighting for political patronage set the tone everywhere.  Most decisions were not passed down from Washington.  As a result, Holt's book roams far and wide analyzing the politcal struggles within the states.  <p>Particularly interesting is the stress politicians put on state and federal patronage as the reward for party loyalty.  Sectionalism and slavery, of course, eventually assume center stage, but always within the context of the particular political struggles among the forces within the various states.  Holt's examination of the struggle over the Wilmot Proviso, the Compromise of 1850, and the damage done to the Whig and Democratic parties by the Kansas-Nebraska Act is nothing short of brilliant. Also profound is his analysis of how prohibitionism and the rise of the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know Nothing movement sent the Whig party to its grave.  These insightful chapters will give any reader a more profound understanding of exactly what was taking place  prior to the Civil War in American political life.  We have Michael Holt to thank for providing us with a more complex, yet well-rounded picture of the causes leading to civil war.  One may be surprised to discover that many of the Whigs in the antebellum South held out hope for a party of national union longer than most of the Whigs in the North.  We all owe Michael Holt a debt of gratitude for his summation of a lifetime of learning.  "The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party" will remain an indispensable reference for anyone interested in the politics of antebellum America.</span>
