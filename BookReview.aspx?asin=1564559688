                    <span>The first time I listened to these tapes, they had a profound effect on me. It seems to me that on listening to E.T. I had a foretaste of the stillness he is speaking about several times. This is the reason why, although I now consider E.T. a third class advaita teacher, I am still willing to recommend this interview to people here on Amazon.com.
<br />
<br />The first part of the interview, which was recorded on September 11 is about the tragedy itself and the meaning of human suffering, the nature of enlightenment, the search for truth and self-knowledge. E.T. says here a number of things which are quite profound and true. The second tape, which was recorded several weeks later, is about E.T. himself, how he became awakened and how he now lives (his mind activity has been reduced by 80%). He also speaks of the wave of enlightenment today, of the uncertain future of the planet and of past masters, whom he beautifully calls "early flowers". 
<br />
<br />Although I can think of lots of much more interesting questions to ask an enlightened person than "are you a mutant?", the interviewer does a good job in the sense that she remains unobstrusive during the whole conversation, which is in fact a kind of monologue. 
<br />
<br />So this is definitely an interesting work. The quality of the sound is impeccable and there are no noisy and disturbing outbursts of laughter from the audience as in "Realizing the Power of Now". Hence maybe its quite hypnotic effect. 
<br />
<br />Having said that, I have become quite dissatisfied with the teachings of E.T., specially as they are set forth in the books and in "Realizing the Power of Now" and therefore recommend that you also buy "As It Is" by Tony Parsons in order to compare what these two supposedly awakened human beings have to say. I think that Tony's message is simpler and less misleading than that of Eckhart, who insists on having you practice awareness and other dualistic stuff one finds in religious traditions. 
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, as far as pure non dualism is concerned, "Even The Sun Will Die" is by and large free of the cheap traditional teachings found in Tolle's other "productions". This is why I still recommend it to you. 
<br />
<br />Bon voyage! </span>

                    <span>I have read and worked with several of Tolle's tapes and found them to be very useful, from a spiritual/meditative standpoint. I find his insights here too to be similar, gets right to the core of the problem of the mind identified society, the confusions we go through as people in navigating this conditioning towards the 'oneness' and such. I find it hard though, to give in to it completely, by it i don't mean the teachings, i mean to Tolle's mindset as it comes through on this particular tape. Yes you can understand where he is coming from, a certain place that is somewhat removed from conditioned responses and perhaps a genuine empathy for what the world and country went through during 9/11. But is it ok to laugh, kindly as it might seem to be? Is it ok to just remove oneself from the pain and talk about what is causing it, almost like a clinical, prescriptive fashion? From a layman perspective those things come across like spiritual arrogance, more than anything else. There is a saying in the Bhagavad Gita that God knows the reasoning behind all things, and yet cries for/with suffering humanity. Sometimes am not sure if Tolle is really reasoning or crying with us, or both. </span>

                    <span>I've listened dozens of times and each time learn something in a deeper way.  The fundamental teaching is of course the same as The Power of Now, yet without as much intellectual explanation, but potentially with more depth if the listener is open.  At the risk of being judgmental, I'm afraid those who have berated these CD's with one star ratings just have not yet "got it" and I urge them not to give up!</span>

                    <span>The mixed reviews do not surprise me. They are an indication that this material is right for someone who has reached a certain point in their development where they are perhaps just at the verge of readiness to surrendering to what IS, rather than trying to control events.<p>I listened to the audio CDs in my car and experienced a sudden shift, a deep understanding, accompanied by lightness and a feeling of expansion, although I had already read the book "The Power of Now". Make no mistake: this is a highly evolved being speaking to you. I understand that it is difficult for a fast-paced culture (like the American) to listen to the silence and laughter and hear the messages in it. This is the point. As to the 9/11 events: how appropriately he addressed this drama. Yes, drama. As it is merely drama that unfolds, but this IS NOT us. We are eternal being caught up in material reality in this incredible drama. Tolle knows how to bring people back to who they REALLY are.</span>
