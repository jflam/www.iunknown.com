                    <span>Meet Faussone, an able tradesmen who sets up cranes around the world and enjoys his work. Most of the several short stories in the book centre on him recounting some interesting job he's been involved in.  
<br /> 
<br />Rather than remain invisible and let 'Faussone' do all the talking, the listener/narrator is also allowed to take on a role - the stories are clearly placed in a setting of Faussone talking to the semi-autobiographical persona of Levi. We learn a little of why he's putting down these stories, his own speculation on whether writing is a worthy 'craft' compared to that of the tradesman, and he even drops in a work story of his own (as a chemist - Levi himself was a chemist) to conclude. Levi highlights the importance of the listener and the context to the stories, which, while entertaining enough to stand on their own, are enhanced by tangents of setting and response. Moreover there's room for just a little plot and relationship development winding alongside the stories. 
<br /> 
<br />As close as I can think of are the James Herriot stories, although I suspect some of Levi's fans would be a bit horrified at the comparison. That being said, I suspect 'Herriot' himself would have enjoyed the book. Levi's stories, however, are not nearly as formulaic (or as funny), and Levi is a more able painter of characters that feel more authentic, and don't necessarily need to be pigeon-holed. Amusing that Faussone feels more authentic than some of Herriot's doubtless 'real' recollected characters: in a postscript Levi says, 
<br />"Faussone is imaginary but "perfectly authentic," at the same time; he is a compound, a mosaic of numerous men I have met, similar to Faussone..."
<br /> 
<br />There's a grace there as well - which some would find bland - this isn't sensationalist fiction with a sting or a belly laugh. Levi does have an agenda - to suggest that a worker who takes pride and pleasure in his trade is as good a subject (and hero) for a novel as any super spy or renegade cop or tortured academic or whatever. There's also an acknowledgement of giving some praise to Levi and Faussone's fathers in this, so perhaps he can be forgiven if his picture is a bit eulogistic. 
<br /> 
<br />The 'wrench' (if the translation got this right) isn't just a symbol of blue collar labour, it's also the wrench between the metaphysical profession of writing books and that of actually making tangible things. The 'Levi' of the stories is struggling with this, and Faussone's parting advice to him is: 
<br />"...I tell you, doing things you can touch with your hands has an advantage: you can make comparisons and understand how much you are worth. You make a mistake, you correct it, and next time you don't make it..." 
<br />and earlier 'Levi' speculated that perhaps so many writers have bad stress because they can't test their work with a level or a gauge, and are working blind half the time. 
<br /> 
<br />So, if you're in the mood for something reflective, diverting, and well written - go ahead. If you're after some action or melodrama, wait for another mood.</span>

                    <span>Excellent series of vignettes/stories generally related within the novel by a crane/derrick rigger to the author, a chemist. For those with no inclination to industrial engineering and chemistry, this book makes the two subjects seem interesting, and uniquely identifies them with the human condition. Quite beautiful.</span>

                    <span>There are some people who you can never hear enough of.  Levi is certainly one of those.  He combines one of the greates talents as a writer in this  century with a wisdom uncommon for any age.<p>This book is not an adventure  story in the typical sence of the word, but reading it is an adventure, and  I for one am a better man for having opened its covers.<p>I don't think  that Levi has ever written a book that I would only read once.  This book,  I look forward to revisting many times over.  The maximum length of this  review is one thousnd words.  If all those words were supperlatives, I  would not come close to doing this book justice.</span>

                    <span>What could be more attracitve? Here's a book about travel in countries all over the globe, and it's made up of conversations between two practical men of the world. A theme--engineers construct things, authors construct  stories--ties the chapters together.<p>A great idea, but, alas, one that  has been turned into a dreadful book. We're warned in the very beginning  that the speaker might, at times, be a bit imperfect: repetetive, full of  himself, prone to get lost in details. But the first chapter shows him,  despite these short-comings, to be fascinating. Nonetheless, in the  chapters that follow, he turns out to be every bit as insufferable as we'd  been told in that first page. <p>Each chapter is filled with mind-numbing  details of construction projects, only relieved, at times, with brief  passages that are more interesting. Levi's book does justice neither to  world travel nor to Italian literature.</span>

                    <span>First, this book is not about Nazi. Second, this author is not an artist( he's more and less than that). <p>This writer is not the straightforward creator who sits in his living-room thinking about life and all; he started  to write inspired by pain and suffering. That means his works are always a  struggle to grasp the poet and entertaining side of art, while being unable  to reach it.<p>This novel is awesome. It says work is one's life and  happiness. All this through the eyes of a travelling chemist admiring a  manual and intellectual worker. It should please every one who needs to  have a different and more constructive, while human, view of work. I  strongly suggest you to buy it. Then send me your opinion.</span>
