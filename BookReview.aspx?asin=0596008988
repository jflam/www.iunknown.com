                    <span>The title is right! This is the book that should have been included in the basic box with XP Pro. It is set at just the right level for the average user trying to come up to speed on a new operating system. While the basic user interface is more or less the same as the previous windows operating systems, the underlying code structure is based on NT rather than the older DOS/Windows.
<br />
<br />This book isn't for system administrators or advanced readers. It's aimed at the average user who wants to master the machine well enough to get down to work or to look up something without having to call for support. It is basically crystal-clear, jargon-free (well, computers are still the subject, how about nearly jargon-free). 
<br />
<br />This edition is up to date to include Service Pack 2, which changed a number of screens and philosophies in the security area. </span>

                    <span>The very latest from David Pogue's eponymous publishing house [and O'Reilly]. The book goes into myriad useful tips on best using Microsoft's XP Professional. A very stable operating system, unlike  some earlier efforts by Microsoft. Replete with attractive consumer level utilities. The book does go into system type aids, like showing the full power of the start menu, taskbar and control panel. All to the good. But somewhat prosaic. 
<br />
<br />I suspect what is more germane to most users are things like getting onto the Internet and all that that implies. The authors go into explaining how to get the most out of Internet Explorer. And setting up your email and doing instant messaging. For many of us, browsing and email will take up much of our usage, with chat perhaps a close third. The reality is that the computer's power is often as a connection to the greater world. Which is why though these chapters are only a fraction of the book, you may want to head here first and read slowly. Understanding them may be the most productive part of the book for you.</span>

                    <span>I expected more from this book since the title implies more information that has not been available. I didn't see anything in the book that was new. 
<br />
<br />It is not a bad manuel but there are several books that provide the same information. Perhaps, the problem with the book is the title because it leads one to think it will include more than it actually delivers.
<br />
<br />If you do not have a good reference book on Windows XP Professional, you would not go wrong with this book.</span>

                    <span>I have bought too many 'helper' books, manuals etc. over the years - and mostly found them cumbersome and hard-to digest. NOT so with the David Pogue & Zacker "Missing Manual". I can relate to several questions that needed explanations - and every time I check them out in this publication - I get the answers that serve my curiosity - and by that, tremendously improve my XP experiences and work. This Manual is for us, who are 'non-geeks' and like to improve our skills. Thank you, guys!</span>

                    <span>This is by far the most understandable XP Pro book I've found. It takes the position that there's nothing wrong with witty, polished prose in technical writing. In fact, the excellence of the writing makes learning far less of a chore than you find in geekier books.<p>As for the gripes by previous reviewers: Good grief! It says right on the cover that the book "isn't for system administrators or OS theory geeks; it's for the novice or budding power user." It's clearly intended for people new to XP Pro, or even intermediate users who'd like a crystal-clear explanation of, say, understanding how file encryption is different in XP Pro and XP Home, or how to dial into your PC from the road using a laptop, or how to set up a home network, step by step.<p>(And to whoever wrote that you can find the same information in the online help--get real!! Microsoft's online help for XP Pro is opaque, humorless, loaded with jargon, and free of illustrations. And above all, it NEVER mentions bugs and problems and workarounds, as this book does.)<p>Bottom line: If you're a network administrator, it's true that you'll be much happier with a much thicker, more technical (and dry-as-dust) book. <p>But if you're a home user, or maybe you've been issued an XP Pro box at work and you want to get the most out of it, this book presents a complete, entertaining, and easily understood a picture of the beast they call Windows XP Professional. HIGHLY recommended.</span>
