                    <span>Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679) was born in England, a country that endured great political turmoil during his life. Having lived through that, Hobbes' main aim was to inquire into the basis of order. The question he asked himself was "What kind of political authority will prevent the return of chaos?". And the answer to that question is in this book, "Leviathan" (1651).
<br />
<br />The Levianthan is the personification of total power, an authority without limits, created by men who realise that absolute power given to a powerfull ruler (or to an assembly) is their only way out of the dangers of the state of nature.  The name that the author chose for his monarch is quite telling: the Leviathan is a sea monster that appears in the Bible and symbolizes power. This kind of monarch seems like an extreme solution for the problem of anarchy, but it is the only one that Hobbes found. Without the Leviathan, life is 'solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.'
<br />
<br />Of course, this book includes many more things than those I have already mentioned. For instance, it explains quite well Hobbes opinion regarding human nature (man is naturally a wolf to men), the state of nature (perpetual war of all against all), the origin of political institutions and the relationship between reason and force (pacts without swords are merely words), among other things.
<br />
<br />On the whole, I think this book is a classic of Political Philosophy, and I recommend it as such. Despite that, I think a word of caution is in order, so you will be prepared for what you will find when you tackle "Leviathan". Truth to be told, sometimes Hobbes' prose is too dry, and in some chapters you will need to plod through some rather arid pages. Moreover, this book isn't written in modern English, what makes it more difficult to understand. Those are the reasons why I give this book four stars instead of five...
<br />
<br />Notwithstanding that, I believe that "Leviathan" is well-worth the effort of reading it, simply because it has some interesting concepts that you should be aware of, even if you don't agree with them. The only way to discuss in a level play field with someone who has totally different ideas is to understand his arguments thoroughly, even if his position seems completely  strange to you. I invite you to do that with Hobbes, reading "Leviathan".

                    <span>The basic question of the social sciences is how humans manage to get along.  Without cooperation, there would be no such thing as society (and so no social sciences, philosophy, history, etc.).  Hobbes was the first political theorist to tackle this question.
<br />
<br />While Hobbes is long-winded in parts, and his spelling and grammar not consistent with modern standards, this book is still worth reading.  Alfred North Whitehead quipped that the entire history of western political philosophy consists of footnotes to Plato.  I respectfully differ, as I believe Plato is now studied purely for historical interest (nobody takes seriously his ideal of a 3 class society led by philosopher kings). Hobbes, however, is the root from which all subsequent western political philosophy has sprung.  Locke's Treatises were a direct response to Hobbes, and helped solidify the social contract tradition.  Nowadays, nearly all western political theorists either accept social contract theory, or at least have to discuss it in-depth in order to show why they reject it.
<br />
<br />Hobbes examines the fundamental issue of "how do humans manage to get along peacefully?"  In an age of terrorism, serial killers and vicious divorce battles, it's still a good question.  Obviously humans do get along together most of the time, but that doesn't make it obvious why or how we do.
<br />
<br />You don't have to accept Hobbes's ideas to get a lot out of this book.  His stark contrast in describing the alternatives available to humans is unparalleled.  While evolutionary theory has gone a long way toward scientifically explaining some types of cooperation, it still hasn't fully explained how strangers in a large society manage to cooperate when, in strictly rational terms, it would be advantageous to screw each other over.  So if Hobbes didn't satisfactorily answer the question either, he at least made a very compelling argument.  </span>

                    <span>I finished reading Leviathan a couple months ago, but cringed every time I thought about writing a review.  The book is large at over 700 pages and covers so much ground, a review would have to be a book in itself to do it justice.  Due to Leviathan's philosophical content and somewhat antiquated language, it's very slow going.  Each page needs time to digest.<p>So I'm not going to bother writing a real review.  I will just say that Leviathan is a 5-star classic and worth your time, if you can deal with reading political philosophy.  Hobbes divides the work into four major sections:<p>Of Man, in which he discusses human nature and why civilized people prefer peace to war.  Here Hobbes establishes the primary reason that people form a government to rule over them: to safeguard them from enemies, both external and internal.<p>Of Common-wealth, in which Hobbes first talks about the several forms of government and the pros and cons of each.  He then explains the rights that a government has over its people; according to Hobbes, the government can do pretty much anything it wants to.  Finally he goes into the things that tend to weaken or dissolve a government.<p>Of a Christian Common-wealth, the longest section, in which Hobbes accepts the Bible as the word of God and quotes from it numerous time to bolster his position in support of a powerful government.<p>Of the Kingdome of Darknesse, the shortest and strangest section, in which Hobbes veers away from the topic of government and instead focuses on religious practices and beliefs of the day that he deems improper and inconsistent with the Bible.<p>It took me months to read this, but I came away with great respect for Hobbes and a better understanding of politics.  I can't say that I agree with everything I read, but I think the majority of his arguments are sound and convincing.<p>Five stars, no doubt in my mind.  But it's a dive into the deep end, so you'll probably only finish it if you really appreciate and enjoy philosophical discussion!</span>

                    <span>leviathan is a true gem. while siding with hume, i'll claim hobbes is more interesting and concise, and less repetitive. the conclusion is almost irrelevant. hasnt anyone noticed that all philosophy is ultimately debated and corrected.</span>

                    <span>OK, first off, skip the ENTIRE BEGINNING SECTION of this book - it is perfectly pointless today.  In it, Hobbes is basically trying to do away with the concept of an immortal soul, thereby creating an atheistic society that cares nothing for religious matters.  Hobbes is NOT known for his Philosophy of Mind.<p>What everyone remembers about Leviathan is Hobbes' terse, cynical, and on-the-money observation that life is "nasty, brutish, and short."  Of course, what he means by this is life in the State of Nature.  In order to try to make life a little better, man comes together to form societies.<p>So far, so good.  What most people take exception to is the kind of Social Contract that Hobbes endorses.  Hobbes says that a society should come together to form a Social Contract in which everyone is OBEY THE SOVEREIGN UNCONDITIONALLY NO MATTER WHAT.  Here's the kicker, the sovereign or king himself exists OUTSIDE OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND IS NOT BOUND BY IT.  In other words, the sovereign can do whatever he likes and the people must obey his commands no matter how cruel or ridiculous. <p>Now, Hobbes was really trying to be more reasonable than he sounds.  He lived at a time when England had spent years torn apart by constant war.  He was also a self-professed coward: "Fear and I were born twins."  Basically, what he wanted was an end to war at all costs.  For him, that meant obeying a STRONG RULER - in his case, Oliver Cromwell.  The second section is addressed to the people trying to make them understand why this is in their best interests.<p>The last section is addressed to the sovereign himself.  Yes, he says, you can be a tyrant and do anything you want, BUT that will only cause you more trouble than it's worth.  I have some advice for you to follow.  Hobbes then goes on to RECOMMEND ways in which the sovereign could be a good ruler.<p>In the end, Hobbes thought he was being an eminently practical man.  To him, the "natural rights theorists" would just be talking nonsense.</span>
