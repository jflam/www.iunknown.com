                <span id="Label1"><I>The Sun Also Rises</I> first appeared in 1926, and yet it's as fresh and clean and fine as it ever was, maybe finer. Hemingway's famously plain declarative sentences linger in the mind like poetry: "Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that." His cast of thirtysomething dissolute expatriates--Brett and her drunken fianc&eacute;, Mike Campbell, the unhappy Princeton Jewish boxer Robert Cohn, the sardonic novelist Bill Gorton--are as familiar as the "cool crowd" we all once knew. No wonder this quintessential lost-generation novel has inspired several generations of imitators, in style as well as lifestyle.<p>  Jake Barnes, Hemingway's narrator with a mysterious war wound that has left him sexually incapable, is the heart and soul of the book. Brett, the beautiful, doomed English woman he adores, provides the glamour of natural chic and sexual unattainability. Alcohol and post-World War I anomie fuel the plot: weary of drinking and dancing in Paris caf&eacute;s, the expatriate gang decamps for the Spanish town of Pamplona for the "wonderful nightmare" of a week-long fiesta. Brett, with fianc&eacute; and ex-lover Cohn in tow, breaks hearts all around until she falls, briefly, for the handsome teenage bullfighter Pedro Romero. "My God! he's a lovely boy," she tells Jake. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn."  Whereupon the party disbands.<p>  But what's most shocking about the book is its lean, adjective-free style. <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> is Hemingway's masterpiece--one of them, anyway--and no matter how many times you've read it or how you feel about the manners and morals of the characters, you won't be able to resist its spell. This is a classic that really does live up to its reputation. <I>--David Laskin</I></span>

                    <span>Reading one of Hemmingway's first acclaimed novels, I felt the Sun Also Rises truly transported me to a different time and place.  The simple narration was colourful and great, and the descriptions of the American and English friends frolicking through the cafes and restaurants left me stunk of wine, and merriment.  Reading this book made my drunk just by all the booze they were consuming.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I didn't feel this novel take off until they arrived in Spain.  Brett is a character that is for sure, but everyone else seems relegated to supporting parts.  I kind of was hoping the story would tell a litte bit more about them.
<br />
<br />I did enjoy the book but only in places, and I also feel that the book seems a bit dated.  But it's a good read no doubt. Yes I liked it.</span>

                    <span>I will never understand Ernest Hemingway's appeal.  His labored attempts at understating everything, his affected grittiness, his belief in himself as adventurer and someone who truly experiences life all make me want to throw up.  This book is the perfect example of how terrible he is.   I'll give you some examples from within the book so you can think about it a little more.
<br />
<br /> Number one is Brett.  The "heroine" of the book, she is a heartless 34-year old nymphomaniac who is self-absorbed and callous, not to mention elitist and stupid.  The "hero" of the book, manly man Jake, "loves" her.  What a great love story.  Jake is too "injured" to make love to her, so she sleeps with a number of other people during the book.   Number two is Cohn.  This character, created out of the author's anti-semitic imagination, is a simpering bookish fool who, the narrator lets us know, is too cowardly to enjoy things like bullfights.  Only a manly man would enjoy the spectacle of a matador being gored by a tortured animal, of course.
<br />
<br />Cohn is apparently equally contemptable because he wants to hang out with gentiles (How DARE he?!), but Jake is magnanimous enough to let him.  Brett is magnanimous enough to sleep with him, but looks down on him for being a Jew.  (Lovely people, aren't they?).  Hemingway wants us to revile Cohn because he took the affair with Brett too seriously and actually got jealous when she slept with someone else.  We're supposed to laugh at Cohn's emotionality and inability to be a wasp.  
<br />
<br />I can't tell you how pointless this book is.  What's the moral?  Is there one?  I don't think there is.  If a book isn't engrossing, or exciting, or beautifully written (therefore art for art's sake) it has to have a message.  This book fails on all counts.</span>

<br />Everyone has a favorite book and this one from Ernest Hemingway is mine. A close second is A MOVEABLE FEAST. So between his first and last I have two of my most favorite books. I also like his TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT, which hardly anyone else likes very much.
<br />
<br />I'm surprised there exist more than 380 reviews here, but also pleased. At least Hemingway, who died in 1961, is still being read by succeeding generations. I think that would have pleased him, but again who knows, for the old rogue could be pretty crusty at times.
<br />
<br />Some of the reviews either don't understand this mostly autobiographical work or just plain don't like it. We are pretty far removed from those times, soon to be a century, but I guess the one thing that surprises me too is the misspellings: one reviewer has misspelled 'Hemingway' several times.  I know it unfair but if a reader can't get the title or author spelled correctly, I am somewhat unlikely to trust what he or she may have to say about what they've read.
<br />
<br />I'm not going to give a high school book review here, too many people have merely regurgitated the contents of the book. That's fine, but I only want to weigh in with my comments that after reading and rereading this book for at least 40 years, I find it just as new and interesting each time I come to it again. And with several hard cover copies of this particular book on my Hemingway shelf that is at the least, once a year.
<br />
<br />Many movies have been made of this novel too, and for my taste the one they hardly ever show starring Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner, and Errol Flynn is the best. It truly captures the panorama of both the writing and locale.  And who ever paid any attention to Pamplona and the running of the bulls each July before "Hem" wrote FIESTA, a title under which it has also been published.
<br />
<br />Well, enough rambling. This is my most enjoyable book, and it's good to know many others enjoy it.  Funny thing, all through high school and college I was never required to read the book. While serving in the military in Japan I checked it out of the Navy/Marine library reading it for the first time.</span>

                    <span>This challenging work by Hemmingway is not only his most profound work, but the quintessential piece on "The Lost Generation." The main character Jake is scarred not only physically but emotionally, and these barriers prove to be impossible to cross to get to his love, the Femme Fatal Brett. The peice shows the attitude that the age of enlightenment had only produced more efficient means to kill eachother in the trenches of world war two, and that no one could ignore the monstrosity of human nature. Isn't it pretty to think that we as humans could if we worked hard enough achieve our goals?  </span>

<br />The novel takes place after the cease of the First World War, where numerous survivors, combatants and non-combatants alike, battle their own demons each day to search for a meaning to their lives that has been shattered by the global conflict. The novel, being borne out of Hemingway's own personal experience, focuses on a group of expatriate individuals living in luxury and elegance in the city of Paris, where the first half of the novel takes place. Paris was a popular place for literary figures during the time, and as mentioned, several of the key characters in this novel are writers that are yet to be granted with global fame. The characters in this novel searches for their lost ideals, living in alcoholism and grandeur that the city of Paris has to offer, and while the Hemingway portrays his characters to do so, he uses the bullfight as a symbol of that moral struggle. The ability to confront your fears, to stand in the way of danger and NOT BREAK, is in direct contrast with the way he paints the lifestyles of his characters. Hemingway uses the perspective of Jake Barnes, the main protagonist, to present the action as it takes place first in the city of Paris, then in some quiet countryside where the novel takes a more "tranquil" turn, then in the city of Pamplona where the fiesta takes place, and lastly in Barcelona, where the novel ends. 
<br />
<br />Jake, who supports himself as a journalist, is madly in love with a promiscuous woman, Lady Brett Ashley, who is in turn engaged to Michael Campbell, one of Jake's companions during the fiesta. Unfortunately, Jake had been injured during the war that left him sexually incapacitated, which served as his scar that shall forever separate him from the woman he loves. Then there is Robert Cohn, who is also in love with Lady Ashley but somehow portrays himself as a guy who sort of "just won't get the message" that he is actually unwanted and that creates tension among the individuals even before the fiesta ever started. (Note: I don't know but somehow I get the feeling that Robert Cohn is actually a physical manifestation of Jake, who is in turn himself is still unable to get over himself and his feeling. But on the other hand, Jake reacts very much differently to Cohn and that somehow Lady Ashley still leans on Jake on some issues regarding her sorrows which she is not able to confess to any other person). And lastly, of the expatriate group, there is Bill Gorton who, a writer just like Cohn, is also Jake's best-friend and much preferred companion than anyone else. And there is also Pedro Romero, the young matador who appears much later in the book, who shall soon participate in a love affair with Lady Ashley and is also a person of great respectability, who faces his fears and struggles "without falsity", which plays an important aspect in his career in the bullfight as well as in the lives of the expatriate personalities, such as Jake and Lady Ashley. 
<br />
<br />Just like the way he wrote his more accomplished novels like A Farewell To Arms or For Whom The Bell Tolls, Hemingway's gift of writing has already been established right from the start. The Sun Also Rises being his first published novel, Hemingway wrote in laconic, yet crisp prose and his dialogue never ceases to generate tension and anxiety between his characters, making this short-length novel a fully pledged work of art. 
<br />
<br />One of the most significant aspects of this novel is maybe the part which is mostly overlooked, which is the part where Jake and Bill goes fishing before they proceed to Pamplona, where the Fiesta de San Fermin is to take place. That part, where Jake goes fishing, somewhat signifies the contentment that Jake has long been yearning for, which shall serve as the catalyst that soon make Jake a different person altogether after the fiesta. With the feeling he experienced during that brief period of time in the midst of a fast-paced novel, he shall soon grow to accept that "he shall never possess the woman he loves" and that universal acceptance is the way where he shall finally be able to attain peace and contentment. By the end of the novel, Lady Ashley learns that too, when she "made him [Pedro] go" and decided not to ruin the young man's life. She said she shall go back to Michael Campbell, to whom she says her "sort of thing", and Jake learns to deal with it. And although he once again tried to lean on alcoholism, Lady Ashley prevented him from doing so and soon in the final scene, they were able to overcome their struggles and live a more normal life. 
<br />
<br />Even though the book focuses merely on the expatriate community in Paris, its moral convictions could adapt to the lives of numerous people, even "normal" people like us. By way of accepting the truth and trying to move on, we are able to break free of the past and in turn be able to adapt to the present world. The Sun Also Rises tells us that everything has a beginning and so is an end, but the earth shall stay forever across generations and that we are but "actors on stages" in this great pattern, and that life is but an unalterable destiny that we should learn to live with. This is a deceptively simple, yet terrific book. , but try it for yourself! Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Hemingway, but very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is "The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.
