                    <span>As a slightly experienced C programmer and a somewhat experienced Python programmer, I found this book useful.  It described Python's features and at the same time put them in the larger context of what modern computer languages do.  Like several other reviewers, however, I think the level of this book would be far too intimidating for someone learning to program for the first time.  Also, for me the final section of the book ("Case Studies") delved too deeply into object-oriented and GUI issues not directly relevant to my work, and I put the book aside at that point.  Bottom line: a nice recap but not really for the novice.</span>

                    <span>In some ways this book seems like it's in search of an identity. It's obviously intended for the novice, and its short chapters and general topics reflect that, but many things are left unexplained or explained poorly, such as the chapter on object-oriented programming. This book definitely fills a niche for introductory python books for an audience with no programming experience, and my frequent frustration has not necessarily outweighed the value of the short chapters on diverse topics. Part of the problem may be that Amazon sold me a copy of the 1st edition rather than the 2nd. I'm going to finish the book soon and print out the Python tutorial to see if that can answer some unanswered questions.</span>

                    <span>I am a graduate student with over 10 programming languages in my toolbox.  Python is by far the easiest to learn, easiest to debug and work with.  My gratitude goes out to the developers of this powerful language.<p>This is an extremely well written with very concise explanations and a great amount of humor added in (look at the Spam class in chapter 6!).<p>This could be the start of a new British Invasion, except this time with the Knights who say "NI".<p>Beginning programmers and experienced developers will frequently reference this book.</span>

                    <span>I'm biased, I wrote it! But Amazon[.com] keep asking me to review it so here I go... It does have exercises, albeit hidden in the text rather than listed at the end of each chapter. That's because it was never intended to be a classtoom text but for enthusiastic amateurs. The best way to learn is type in the examples, then modify them. There are, sadly, a lot of minor typos, fixes are posted on the web site.<br>Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>This was my first introduction to Python with little programming experience in general.  The author does a great job of ramping into examples containing 'real world' relevant code.  This book is a refreshing change from the apparent trend of 'the more pages, the better' Material is condensed into small bite-sized chunks of 5-6 pages.</span>
