Offering riveting battle narratives and a balanced perspective that avoids simple triumphalism, <b>Carnage and Culture</b> demonstrates how armies cannot be separated from the cultures that produce them and explains why an army produced by a free culture will always have the advantage.</span>

                    <span>Hanson's "Carnage and Culture" is worth reading for its vigorous style as well as its thought-provoking thesis. Books about military history are often fairly dry, but Hanson writes clearly and in the active voice, perhaps unconciously emulating the Western military tactics he describes.<P>He argues that Western success on the battlefield is a cultural phenomenon, not just the result of good fortune in the allocation of resources or the serendipity of technology. Free nations produce leaders and soldiers who take the initiative. Citizens who are protected by law against arbitrary action feel free to "audit" battles and criticize soldiers, leading to improved strategy and tactics. Western military commands are heirarchical, but not unduly so, so that they adapt well to changing circumstances. The result is an approach to battle that has been evolving since the time of the ancient Greeks, and that now involves applying maximum disclipline and violence at the point of engagement in order to annihilate, not merely defeat, an opponent. <P>Hanson discusses a series of battles to illustrate the differences between the "Western" style of war and the practices of cultures that he deems to be "non-Western": Salamis (480 BC); Gaugamela (331 BC); Cannae (216 BC); Poitiers (732); Tenochtitlan (1520-21); Lepanto (1571); Rourke's Drift (1879); Midway (1942) and Tet (1968). Each of these struggles illustrates a Western preference for decisive battle that inflicts enormous and disproportionate casualties on the loser.<P>Throughout, Hanson is very careful to stress that the losers are brave, smart individuals--he is not a racist and goes out of his way to explain that, person for person, the citizens of the West are no better than their non-Western counterparts. He does, however, argue that Western culture, for better or worse, produces better results on the battlefield than non-Western culture does. This position is sure to be viewed as politically incorrect, but it is certainly worth pondering.<P>"Carnage and Culture" is particularly interesting in these troubled times. I began reading the book shortly after the September 11 attacks, and I have found it to be highly predictive of the American conduct of the war in Afghanistan, as well as America's relentless success in that war. The collapse of the Taliban that seems remarkable to media pundits and those untutored in the Western way of war looks almost inevitable to those who have read Hanson's work. A wounded republic, like Rome after its horrendous defeat at Cannae, is a determined and ruthless enemy. As the historian Ross Leckie wryly observed in "Hannibal": "The Romans were a thorough lot. Carthage is a memory."<P>Having said all this, Hanson's book leaves almost untouched some fairly important questions. If freedom and initiative are so critical to Western military success, how do we explain the performance of totalitarian Germany's military in the early years of World War II and its quick defeat of the French democracy in 1940? Why were the Soviets, who endured purges and arbitrary executions in the 1930s and throughout World War II, ultimately successful against the more "Westernized" Germans? I suspect that Hanson could offer cogent answers to these questions, but it puzzles me that he did not volunteer them in his book.</span>

                    <span>Love him (and I do) or hate him, Victor Davis Hanson's work is dependably bold and provocative. One of his latest books, "Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power," is certainly no exception.<P>The book was written, at least in part, as a response to the critically acclaimed and wildly popular "Guns, Germs and Steel" by Jared Diamond. Hanson derides the geographic deterministic conclusions presented by Diamond - the idea that Western power is more or less a fluke of geography - and lays out an alternative explanation for the dominance of the Western world over other cultures. But rather than offering an alternative anthropological perspective, Hanson uses military history to explain the West's dominance since the Hellenistic age. From a strictly objective and amoral perspective, Hanson says, Western liberal democracies have proven incredibly efficient at killing enemies in war and thus conquering much of the globe.<P>Hanson central thesis is that there are nine "paradigms" that, when combined, account for the superiority of Western warfare and the extreme bloodshed when Western nations fight one another: 1) political freedom as the cornerstone of Western culture from which all else flows; 2) the quest for decisive battles of annihilation rather than ritualistic battle often found in non-Western cultures; 3) the concept of military service as a civic duty, which provides the West with large numbers of highly motivated troops; 4) a focus on heavy infantry shock engagements; 5) a spirit of rationalism and the scientific method, which has paid huge dividends in the form of advanced military technology; 6) the economic model of capitalism, which has exploited technological advances to their fullest and rapidly put weapons in the hands of large Western armies; 7) the discipline to fight as a unit and thus get the most out of Western technology and mass production capability; 8) individualism and initiative in battle; and 9) dissent, self-critique and civic audit of military operations. He uses individual East-West battles - including Western "defeats" such as Cannae, Isandhlwana (along with his discussion of Rorke's Drift) and Tet (from a strategic perspective) - throughout history to illustrate each of the paradigms. The author is quick to note that his selection of battles has little to do with his overall conclusions and that a completely different collections of battles could be used to demonstrate the same points.<P>Each chapter is well written and vivid in its description of the various battles (early on Hanson notes that war is all about killing men, not the more antiseptic issue of strategy). For those whose reading has tended to focus on contemporary military history, the early chapters on Salamis, Guagamela, Cannae (Hanson is a professor of classics, so these first three are his speciality), Poitiers and Tenochtitlan will be particularly enlightening and rewarding. <P>In the end, Hanson's arguments are compelling, but far from convincing. The notion that Western scientific inquiry and commercial enterprise have greatly facilitated military power is undeniable. So too is his argument that military professionalism and its focus on discipline have proven decisive in lopsided engagements. However, the idea that only citizens of a Western democracy can field large armies of motivated men capable of initiative or that seeking decisive shock battle is key to victory are much more debatable. Nevertheless, "Carnage and Culture" is worth your time and highly recommended - even if you challenge most of Hanson's conclusions.</span>

                    <span>I'm about half way through the book and so far it seems very well thought out. My biggest complaint is how Salamis is glorified and Thermopylae's contribution to the Greek defense is downplayed to a ridiculous extent. Overall Carnage and Culture is a very well thought out book that explains Western military dominance.</span>

                    <span>In Carnage and Culture, Victor Hanson regularly warns his readers that he is not interested whether the primacy of the West on the battlefield is morally superior to, or far more despicable, than that of its Non-Western adversaries. Hanson's originality and genius lies in his systematic (to some readers ad nauseam) demonstration that the military superiority of the West mirrors larger social, economical, political and cultural practices that at first glance have not much relevance to the art and science of warfare. Unlike most historians, Hanson rightly believes that this superiority of the West is not merely due to superior weapons. Only the Western culture has had the discipline, morale and sheer technology expertise in perfecting its killing know-how over time as Hanson efficiently demonstrates through his narration and analysis of nine landmark battles. Hanson makes clear that he has not selected a few battles that by coincidence or sheer luck prove his point. <P>Hanson also drives the point home that he does not downplay the courage that adversaries of the Western armed forces have often displayed for naught on the battlefield. Sometimes, the West was outsmarted temporarily but ultimately regained its supremacy over its Non-Western enemies because of its cultural institutions. Hanson convincingly shows that not even battlefield inexperience, lack of courage, outnumbered troops or poor command has had any lasting impact on Western dominance in battle. Citizens systematically turn out to be history's deadliest killers. Reaction, innovation, initiative and individualism have often outweighed the merits of method, consensus and adherence to hierarchy and protocol.<P>Furthermore, Hanson states that the West was not naturally smarter than the rest of the world. Unlike some historians, Hanson rightly does not believe in a deterministic approach to Western military superiority based solely on biology, geography and guns. In his examination of the Battle of Tenochtitlan, Hanson however acknowledges that disease and hunger helped Hernan Cortes and his men finish the job and overcome the resistance of Amerindians. However, the victory of Spain over Mexicas was primarily due to the military brilliance, ruthlessness and courage of Cortes and his main lieutenants in 1520-1521.<BR> <BR>Evolving capitalist and democratic institutions, free inquiry as well as rationalism, have often given Western capitalists and scientists a pragmatic and utilitarian umbrella protecting them from religious fundamentalists, state censors or stern cultural conservatives. The West has not hesitated to incorporate the best military practices of its adversaries into its wars of annihilation or improvise on the battlefield with deadly effect. Western military forces have almost always been interested first in the decisive crushing and destruction of their adversaries, and then in social recognition, religious salvation and cultural status. <P>Hanson shows that Alexander the Great discarded Western rationality in favor of Asian theocracy during his Asian conquests in the fourth century BC that ultimately resulted in plutocratic god-kingdoms, unstable Hellenism in Asia and the destruction of embryonic democracy in Greece. Unsurprisingly, the Roman Republic truthful to Hellenic politics, civic militarism and decisive shock-and-awe warfare destroyed these degenerated god-kingdoms across its way one after the other in the next three centuries. Other dynasts fell victim to this Western dual idea of free citizen/soldier in the following centuries without ever getting it before Rome crushed them decisively. <P>Despite the ultimate destruction of the long-lasting Roman Empire, this Western tradition of warfare was not lost in Europe. Islamic armies got a bitter taste of these warfare strategies and tactics at the decisive land battle of Tours-Poitiers in 732 and at the sea battle of Lepanto in 1571, despite their fighting spirit. <P>Hanson also reminds his audience that the West generally has a dislike of wars waged in jungles, stealthily at night and as counter-terrorists to combat enemies who avoid direct and open confrontation with it. The frightful losses inflicted on western civilians and soldiers are considered cowardly and do not reflect the open and direct warfare style that the West deems fair on the battlefield. Non-Western men and women have often joined Western armies to help neutralize other Natives due to a perceived fairness of Western conquerors. <P>Finally, Hanson observes that many adversaries of the West have realized that merely possessing Western weapons is not enough to ultimately be victorious. These adversaries have often made the historic error to assume that Western democracies, slow to anger, are somehow weak and timid.</span>

                    <span>If you read Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond, then also read this book. Then decide if Diamond's central conclusion---that it is chiefly the random advantage of geography which has accidentally allowed some cultures to become dominant, and left others subordinate---is correct. Or, as Hanson argues, is it instead the importance of human-created cultural traits which comprise the central driving force allowing the dominance of certain cultures over others? <P>After carefully reading both, I'd have to side with Hanson. He's not completely right, but he makes one heck of a case.</span>
