                    <span>This book is such a hack it would be more useful if presented in typeset LaTeX. It has no breadth, no sense of coverage. It's not a matter of being for advanced users, it's a matter of being hacked together from digital scraps instead of properly written. It's the worst. Stick to Lamport and web sources, these guys obviously publish for their resumes.<P>No doubt the authors are great LaTeX hackers, but unfortunately it appears that they are only that. Hackers. <P>Yes, I am frustrated with this book. When I want to do something in LaTeX (which I've been using for five years) and refer to this title, the index is useless, instead I take the hacker's approach and treat it not as literature but as source code. I scan it. Unfortunately I can't grep it.<P>Frankly I don't understand how others could give it high ratings. I think they're too easily impressed. This book is not even consistent within a page. I wonder, "Did you read it?" The examples don't even compile half the time! <P>Too bad it's not just LaTeX source cover to cover. That would be much more useful, and a much better value for the thing.<P>The one thing this book (and this series no doubt) has is lots of pictures describing layout. I don't know how good they are, I don't fiddle with bits. The authors' three books should have been one good book on what they really want to present. Graphics.</span>

                    <span>The companion to the book "LATEX" by Leslie Ramport.

Basic Formatting Tools, 4.) The Layout of the Page, 5.) Tabular Material, 6.) Mastering Floats, 7.) Font Selection 8.) Higher Mathematics, 9.) LATEX in a Multilingual Environment, 10.)

                    <span>Yeah, the index is pretty appalling; yeah, learning LaTeX via this route was rough; nevertheless, short of trying to decipher the minimally commented LaTeX source code, it's the only place to find a wide variety of facts.<P>Speaking of the source code, isn't it about time that someone wrote up a nice thorough plain-English description of what exactly LaTeX contributes to TeX, and how it does it? That way there would be a way to learn everything at the highest level: read the TeXbook, then read what I envisage. At present, the vast number of `@'-commands, which you need to grasp for writing macros, aren't documented anywhere outside of the source code. <P>Also, does anyone know the inside scoop on the progress of NTS/LaTeX3?</span>

                    <span>My personal favorite. I have been using both the German and the English version of this boock since 1996, and I just love it. Granted, the world has moved on, and many things about LaTeX have changed and still are, and yet, there is so much information in this book. I only hope the authors soon prepare an updated version including the latest developments.</span>

                    <span>This is a very complete concise reference to the PACKAGES of LaTeX. It won't teach you well how to use LaTeX, but more how to use all of the standard packages. It is far more of a reference book than a read-to-learn book. An excellent reference book at that.</span>
