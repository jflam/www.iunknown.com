                    <span>We've seen so many de-cluttering and organizing books over the last five years that you wouldn't think there was room for anything new. Yet, Sunny Schlenger's Organizing for the Spirit is a breath of fresh air.<P>Schlenger has always taken a different approach, promoting that each individual has his own organizing style and needs. Her new book helps you take stock of all aspects of your life, identify what really matters, and then set priorities. For example, you end up knowing what your stuff means to you, how it helps or hinders you, and what you can do to make that stuff be part of your personal development.<P>An easy read, "Organizing for the Spirit is about achieving harmony between our inner and outer selves," says the author.</span>

                    <span>I just finished this book last night and it's really, really wonderful. I cried on the last page!! Nobody does that with a self-help book!!! Sunny Schlenger has created something inspirational, and the writing has Zenlike moments of lucidity that are timeless and gorgeous. If you want to think about your life in a truly new way, this is the book for you.</span>

                    <span>Imagine if we could really look at our lives without procrastination. Imagine if we could disarm our defenses and misperceptions. And imagine if we were consumed by this new transformation, all because we explored the possibility of reorganizing the contents of our lives. Much like the way emotional intelligence is the ability to manage our emotions, this book helps you manage your life with a heightened self. Henceforth the evolutionary step of Organizing for the Spirit. I highly endorse this book.</span>

                    <span>This is what I call a birthday present I will give to all of my friends. Finally, someone who realizes the personal reward and power of organizing the spiritual and emotional self. This book gently guides us through our emotional investments and addictive choices, so we can manage our time better. It makes us see how the synergy of our feelings and beliefs can help us actualize our authentic self, or as Sunny Schlenger says Organizing for the Spirit. Get this book and your life will be more simple.</span>

                    <span>Wow! Do I love this book! I came from the computer industry where we managed information in enlightening and entertaining ways. We revolutionized information. This book revolutionizes our baggage into "transformational art" and makes us see how to be in charge of our lives. This is what we call empowerment and realignment.</span>
