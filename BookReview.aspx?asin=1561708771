                    <span>I thoroughly love this book.  Briefly, The Four Agreements are: 1. Be impecable with your word.  2. Don't take anything personally.  3. Don't make assumptions.  4. Always do your best.  This is such a moving book because it is the real truth.  You will 'feel' that as you read.  Don Miguel Ruiz explains that we (humans) have become mired in others 'black magic',others 'mitote.'   That we have been domesticated by others from birth.  We have choosen to believe what we have been programed to believe .... that we are imperfect, we are bad, that we are seperate, etc. He explains that we can create a Heaven on Earth by reclaiming ourselves, our happiness, that is our birth right, by not believing all the lies we've been given.  I don't want to give too much of this book away because it is so wonderful.  The words of an incredibly wise Shaman.  With each reading, the meaning becomes greater.  If everyone read this book, the world would be tremendously better off.</span>

                    <span>Miguel Ruiz has an alluring introduction that mixes myths, with ancient mexican wisdom. After the enchantment of the introduction the core of the book becomes totally practical, step by step his words made me make my own commitment. To remember the main facts After I read it I wrote on my mirror:<p>1. Be irreproachable with my words, no more bad thoughts and gossips towards others I thought " My life is so interesting (and if its not I'll make it interesting) that I don't want to waste my time in others businesses"<p>2. Do not take anything personal. When Miguel Ruiz wrote "Nobody does things because of others, we do things because of our selves..." I got an epiphany!! I understood that my soured past was not created by others on purpose is just that we are trying to survive in this world that is human to be selfish and only look for us.<p>3. Do not make any assumptions: Ask! This sounds very simple, but for me had an extraordinary meaning. I usually spend a lot of time dreaming with my eyes wide open.. what I imagine are only illusions suppositions of situations that did not happened or would never happen. These images come to my mind trying to be solved towards a happy ending based on suppositions of others attitudes, thoughts or behaviors. I am living in dreams this is not reality. What I fool I've been!<p>4. Do your best: This chapter challenge us,  but at the same time protects our soul for being damaged in this demanding world, it creates the healthy environment facing our possibilities with our capabilities.<p>Finally the book gives us again a hint of spirituality, and mention the importance of living the moment, of finding the meaning of life which can either be interpreted as inner peace or eternal happiness.<p>Of easy reading this substantial book will maintain your attention till the end.</span>

                    <span>As a Spanish teacher I am always interested in cultural beliefs and practices of the ancients. I think much can be learned by going back to simple things such as these four things.<p>Ruiz has a nice style, but the only drawback I found was the first couple chapters took away somewhat from the impact of the rest of the book. The stars are lights, lights are stars, etc was kind of out there. I found myself putting up with that part to get to the wisdom I found later in the book. <p>I found these four agreements useful and I loved the book overall. I just think some people won't get to the good stuff because the first part is so abstract. <p>It's only my opinion. :)</span>

                    <span>I carry these cards with me in my car and every morning on my commute to work, I draw one card and meditate on that agreement and its message.  More often than not, the card I draw addresses an issue with which I am dealing. These cards have strengthened my soul. I love them.</span>
