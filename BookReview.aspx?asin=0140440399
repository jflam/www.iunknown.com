                    <span>"History of the Peloponnesian War" is Thucyidides' account of the 27-year war between Athens and Sparta which began in 431 BC.  The Penguin edition is just over 600 pages and can be very slow for a modern-day reader, but it is worth the effort as much of it is still amazingly practical, especially in today's wartime world.  Unfortunately Thucydides' account ends 7 years before the end of the war (which Sparta won, but in a rather Pyrrhic victory) so be prepared for some disappointment at the conclusion of a long read.  
<br />
<br />The narration of the book is rather dry at points (which is understandable in that it was written 2400+ years ago), but Thucydides' summations of the major speeches at high points of the war are excellent.  His recap of the speech made by the Athenian general Pericles, appealing to his people for continuation of the battle at a point when their morale was very low, reads like it could have been taken from a present-day newspaper within the past few years.
<br />
<br />Be prepared to have to give some effort to get through this book, but you'll be better off for doing so.</span>

                    <span>I will spare a full-blown review. But if you have the extra money or could easily afford it, I would recommend the newer more expensive edition of this book with the introduction by Victor Davis Hanson. There, you will have maps to your hearts content, including chapter summaries. This edition lacks in both of these areas. As a result, this edition gets 4 stars, while the history written by Thucydides is beyond measure.</span>

                    <span>"History of the Peloponnesian War" is, superficially, merely an account of a war that happened centuries ago, the Peloponnesian War, between Athenas and Sparta. Of course, you might think that the subject is trivial to you. After all, how important can a book like that be?. Well, if you were to think that, you would be enormously mistaken.<p>To start with, this book is a milestone you need to be aware of. Thucydides, its author, is very possibly the first modern historian. He tried to explain the causes of the Peloponnesian War, without reducing its complexity by saying that the gods had motivated it. Thucydides doesn't follow the easy path; instead, he searches those causes in human nature, and in power. He doesn't weave tales, but tries to write History.<p>It is rather astonishing how objective this Athenian was when he analyzed the war, and all that happened immediately before it. He examines methodically many events, paying special attention to facts. The author also gives his opinion from time to time, but he doesn't judge whether an action is good or evil: he merely shows that those that have power can use it as they see fit. Due to that, Thucydides is called by many the first realist theoretician.  I was especially taken aback by how well he expresses his ideas regarding the fact that "power makes right" in the Melian debate. I don't agree with him, but I cannot deny that he makes a powerful case, and that his point of view is shared nowadays by many noteworthy thinkers.<p>It is important to point out that in "History of the Peloponnesian War" you will find a painstaking account of many things that actually happened, but also some speeches that weren't made by the actors, but could have been made by them. To explain that more clearly: Thucydides wrote some political dialogues and monologues that allow us to understand some aspects of the conflict (and many of his ideas) better. The introduction to this edition also highlights that the author sometimes made up some of the speeches (from the data he had), and was present when others were pronounced. My favorite speech is the one made by Pericles, in honor of the men who died during the war. In that discourse, he explains why those men fought and died to defend Athens, and what Athens meant not only for Athenians but also for Greece.   <p>This book isn't easy to read, but it is well-worth the effort. The translation is quite good, so that will make your task a little easier. If you don't feel like reading this book all at once, try to read it little by little. The results will be the same, but you won't feel dismayed by the need of finishing it immediately. <p>Also, if you can, try to relate some of Thucydides themes to our modern world. You will find that easier that you might think, and it will make you pay more attention to what you are reading. You are likely to be very surprised, for example, at how similar some of nowaday's justifications for taking advantage of power without paying attention to justice are to those that Thucydides already made a long time ago. On the whole, I highly recommend this book :)<p>Belen Alcat</span>

                    <span>Thucydides earned an honored spot among ancient writers by being one of the first to break with the old ways. Up to his time natural disasters, national defeat and personal tragedies were blamed on the "gods".  This remained true even when the writers themselves doubted the existence of those beings. <p>Thucydides took part in the famous war between Athens and Sparta and somehow made the decision to  - for the first time - write a factual historical record of the events instead of using legends and tales.  He conducted interviews, traveled for first-hand investigation and laid out not only the war but the political and social conditions that surrounded the event.  <br>If one were to judge the work based on the literary quality of the content it would be difficult to award the five stars.  But the translator has made the best of an old style of writing that is detailed, pedantic and remorseless with the facts and consequences of mistakes.  It is a miracle - and a blessing -  that some anonymous scribe in a small room with candle and quill undertook the task of replicating his words for us almost 2,500 years later.</span>

                    <span>I had a Greek teacher who loved Herodotus, and did not love Thucydides. The consequences where not, perhaps, what you might expect. In the event, when we studied Herodotus, she would chatter on about the background, the characters. When we came to Thucydides, without nearly so much to entertainer, we just read the Greek.<p>Good thing, too. Herodotus' Greek is not elegant, and it is not pure Attic. But it is accessible to the relative novice. Thucydides, on the other hand, is about as hard as it comes - made worse by the fact that he is most accessible where he is least interesting, which is to say in the passages of pure battle narrative. It is in the "reflective" passages - where his "characters" are trying to explain or justify their actions, or where he is simply trying to make sense of an appalling calamity - that he is most obscure.<p>Is this an accident? I think not. Thucydides is, after all, an originator. He is perhaps not quite the first to give us a narrative of events, but he is surely the first to try to make sense of it all. And to recognize the path taken by his own beloved country as the course of stark strategy. It is the story, in short (at least at one level) of how a nation perhaps too rich and too self assured, can go terribly wrong.<p>It was fashionable to cite Thucydides in the dark days of the Vietnam War. I wonder if the comparison shows us too much flattery. For Thucydides' story is not only a story about the arrogance of power. Athens at its best was a priceless treasure. Anyone can throw away an opportunity, but some opportunities are better than others. <p>Suggestion: of all the readers who responded to the challenge of Thucydides, none met it more dramatically than Thomas Hobbes, the British political philosopher who began his career by fashioning the first great English translation of the Peloponnesian War. Hobbes' 17th-Century translation is perhaps not the most accessible, and I gather it is not the most accurate. But Hobbes has a gnarly directness of his own, and echoes of Thucydides reverberate through just about everything he later wrote.</span>
