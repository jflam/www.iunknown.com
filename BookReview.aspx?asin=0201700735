Based on the ANSI/ISO C++ standard, The C++ Programming Language provides current and comprehensive coverage of all C++ language features and standard library components.  <P>For example:   <P>abstract classes as interfaces  class hierarchies for object-oriented programming  templates as the basis for type-safe generic software  exceptions for regular error handling  namespaces for modularity in large-scale software  run-time type identification for loosely coupled systems  the C subset of C++ for C compatibility and system-level work  standard containers and algorithms  standard strings, I/O streams, and numerics  C compatibility, internationalization, and exception safety   <P>Bjarne Stroustrup makes C++ even more accessible to those new to the language, while adding advanced information and techniques that even expert C++ programmers will find invaluable.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed C++ Programming Language but it takes some time to grasp all the concepts presented. I understand that this was to have been more of a tutorial than previous editions but I question that. The author gives a brief example of a particular topic without much explanation and then moves on to the next leaving much assumption to the reader. His tone at time takes on a "but of course you would have know that already, right?" kind of attitude even when his point may not be completely clear. Now I've read several C++ books and am what I would consider myself an avid C++ programmer. As such, I was able to eventually make sense of most everything. However, I would not recommend this book to someone who has no previous background in C++. The tone and style are definitely more suited to someone with prior experience in C++. One very nice thing about the book, though, was the author's insight into the language itself and it's evolution. Very nice.</span>

                    <span>I don't understand anyone who would give this book a negative review. I've been in the field for 19+ years and have yet to see a better reference manual in any subject. And that's what it is, a reference manual for those who already know the language. It shouldn't be judged by any other standard, in particular by novices still learning the language. I've seen plenty of books on the subject and none come close to Stroustrup's. And why should they. Stroustrup is the language's inventor and nobody knows the subject better than him. It clearly shows in the detail and understanding that leaps off each page. And the great thing is you can trust what you're reading because you absolutely know it's correct. That security is rare with most authors. So why read a 3rd-party synopsis on relativity if you have a book by Einstein himself (ok, we all know Einstein was in his own league but the point is made). This book isn't a treatise on C++ and isn't intended to be. It's a reference manual and it fullfils that role with excellence, touching just about every major component of the language. Quite a feat considering the book's compactness coupled with the language's huge size and complexity. It doesn't take long to realize how extensive Stroustrup's understanding is of not only C++, but programming in general. I thought I was good after hundreds of thousands of lines of code, but here is a real master and it clearly shows. Between this book and my copy of the C++ standard itself, I have rarely ever had to consult any other source. If you're an experienced or otherwise competent C++ developer than neither will you. If you're a novice, buy it anyway. You'll ultimately need it.</span>

                    <span>A friend gave me this book. I have used it only in times where I already had done what I wanted to do, I just could't remember exactly how to do it. Implication: this is a horrible book from which to learn. If you don't know how to do something in C++, you won't learn it here. However; if you want to remember something, the detail in this book makes it an indespensible reference.<P>More positively, this book covers everything I have ever eneded to know, and I imagine it covers everything there is to know about C++. I think anyone who writes in C++ needs this on the shelf; for Christ's sake, Stroustrup wrote the freakin language!<P>Bottom line: Learn it first, buy this book for reference later.</span>
