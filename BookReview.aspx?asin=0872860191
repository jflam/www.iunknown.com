                    <span>"Kaddish" is Ginsberg's memorable and moving autobiographical poem about his mentally ill mother and his troubled relationship with her. This long poem is a sort of elegy written after his mother's death, and after recounting his feelings and incidents in her life, he gives his farewell. Another poem I really like in this collection is "At Apolinaire's Grave."

                    <span>What is the true job of a poet and artist? As on  answer on could says that his job is to linger the pain of suffering. The poet becomes a man who brings water to the one who suffers, brings understandment, and widens the  picture of reality. This is on of the importent things Kaddish is about.  Allen Ginsberg wrote this poem to his mother who became insane during his  childhood. During her periods of sanity she brought and taught him  importent values, things to live for, political point of vievs and  understandmens, which gave him perspectives for the rest of his life. The  poem is also a great political statement against the existensial order,  normality conserned. It shows us the political implications of Naomis  madnes. The poem makes clear that her madnes has a connection with the  order of modernity in capitalist America. At the same time whe are shown  the human experience of lolines that comes out from being left off with the  label mad. The sad and unbearebel feelings of guilt and anger felt by  Ginsberg himself. An over it all something more, something beautiful about  the human relation of love between mother and child which is flaming strong  trough all this horrible prospects of shame and suffering. At the end of  the poem and in the begining, Ginsberg is dweling with the question of the  death of his mother. For him it was in on sense a relief, but at the same  time is was his greatest loss, and the ambivalence of this question goes  trough the hole poem.</span>
