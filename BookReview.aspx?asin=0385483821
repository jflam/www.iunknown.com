<br />Andy Grove, CEO of the phenomenally successful Intel Corp, is clearly 
<br />worth listening to on the subject of management.  The "Wintel" 
<br />success story is well known.  More harrowing was Intel's earlier self-
<br />transformation from making memory chips to making 
<br />microprocessors.
<br />
<br />How to steer an enterprise thru a major change in its business, per 
<br />Mr. Grove:  
<br />
<br />1)  Figure out if a major change is imminent.  If so, you're about to 
<br />enter what Grove calls "the valley of death".
<br />
<br />2)  Figure out how to deal with it.  Largely (for CEOs), this involves 
<br />listening to your employees & doing your homework.
<br />
<br />3)  Set a new course, sell it to your company, and stick to it.
<br />
<br />The "secret" to success here is identifying the oncoming crisis early & 
<br />reacting sensibly.  He relates the story of Apple, a company with clearly 
<br />superior products - the Mac operating system, the first good laser 
<br />printer - completely missing the shift from proprietary to open 
<br />PC standards, and ending up as a niche player.  John Sculley, then 
<br />Apple's CEO, acknowledged this crucial mistake years later.  Groves 
<br />thinks Sculley knew this shift was happening , but wasn't able to 
<br />overcome Apple's "inertia of success".   Curiously, this was pretty 
<br />much the same problem IBM had when PCs began displacing 
<br />mainframes.  It's very hard for an organization to give up a strategy 
<br />that has been richly rewarded in the past.
<br />
<br />In management, as in engineering, we often learn more from failures 
<br />than successes.  Grove's case histories will make informative reading 
<br />for anyone in business.  Not many of us are CEOs, but we'll all go thru 
<br />Grove's "strategic inflection points" in our careers.

                    <span>Complacency is one of the biggest enemies of any organization, but especially for successful ones like Intel. ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE provides two powerful observations that will help anyone who reads this book: (1) That changes are lurking out there that need immediate attention inside your organization and (2) That you must be constantly vigilant for large discontinuous changes (such as those driven by microprocessors, Intel's main product). Having the perspective of someone who has been both the beneficiary and the target of discontinuous change, Dr. Grove's lessons become all the more real. At first, I thought this book was a little overdone; but upon reflection, I feel that complacency is probably best overcome by paranoia in the absence of the management process to locate, anticipate, create and adapt to externally-driven discontinuous changes. I often cite this book in our writings about how to be more successful, because I believe it is an important work. Please read this book, and take its lessons seriously. But have fun while you are being paranoid!</span>

                    <span>Very few people in history have the true gift of foresight; Andy Grove is certaintly one of those people.  It also shows people like Nick Carr can be idiots. He proclaimed that "I.T. is dead".  Nick Carr thinks he is smart because he is able to see a few years into the future and pat himself on the back for it at the same time.  Andy Grove's vision is not linear and thus allows him to anticipate changes in business paradigms and to distinguish between tech fads and tech innovations.  Ironically, the chapter that made the most sense to me was regarding inflection points in your career.    <p>This book is a must read even if you don't have any inclination for business.  Andy Grove has sound and practical advice for anyone to follow.</span>

                    <span>Like many popular management books, Andy Grove's "Only the Paranoid Survive" is unlikely to knock your socks off with its insightful business advice.  Rather, the book is chock full of common sense, backed up with case studies from the world of successful -- and not so successful -- American businesses.  Although Grove wrote this book during the early days of the Internet bubble, he clearly did not get wrapped up in the all of the excitement of that era, much to his credit.  His thoughts are measured, sensible and coldly rational, as befits an industry titan and the ex-CEO of the most successful chip company on the planet.<p>If you haven't read this book, now is as good a time to do so as any.  Today's readers have the benefit of knowing how technology and business have evolved since "Only the Paranoid Survive" was published in 1996.  The seven years that have since elapsed reveal that Grove really knows what he's talking about.  His understanding of how the Internet would affect Intel underscores his management prescience.  And his skepticism regarding gee-whiz technological innovations like "Internet appliances" provides an interesting example of how Intel maintained its strategic focus, and emerged from the bubble as strong as ever.<p>"Only the Paranoid Survive" breaks no new ground in the business-management genre.  But the book is well written, well organized, and well worth the read for those who want a glimpse inside the mind of an incomparable American success story.</span>

                    <span>Only the Paranoid Survive will never be compared with Churchill's memoirs in terms of literary mastery, but Andrew Grove's book does succeed where many other business tell-alls fail: It illustrates the lessons that you can learn from the challenges that its protagonist has overcome. In other words, this book teaches you something. By focusing on the make-or-break turning points that determined Intel's fate, Grove shows how to manage crises in order to seize the opportunities that they so often provide. For this simple lesson, we from getAbstract recommend this book to all business readers.</span>
