                    <span>With no previous experience, I began construction of a log home in 1997.  I had conducted an extensive literature search prior to beginning the project and had purchase several of the major texts available.  After construction of the foundation and three courses of logs, I found "Log Construction Manual" by Robert Chambers.  For the remainder of the project I used "Log Construction Manual" as my primary reference.  The material is ourstanding, well written and complete.  His log selection method to control shoulder height is second to none. I highly recommend this publication.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent "Manual".  Most all the info you need if you want to build a hand scribed round log cabin,but no color pictures.   If your looking for technical building info this is your book.  I bought almost every book available on log homes building and I wouldn't be with out this if you plan to build one yourself.  Not much on house plans or pic's though.</span>

                    <span>I am so thankful and excited that I found the Log Construction Manual by Robert W. Chambers. I have many other books on the same subject and have always wanted to learn the craft by self study, but I have not been impressed with any book until now. Robert Chambers is perhaps the world's best, a master, of full- scribe log construction to date! It is refreshing to read something that broke through the old ways of log building that have been used and practised for a hundred years.<br>Mr. Chambers is an inspiration and I feel so confident from learning from his book that I will now build the best log cabin I could have ever hoped for. <br>Thank you so much, Robert. I will be forever grateful that you shared your wisdom and great knowledge through your book, it is a treasure!</span>

                    <span>I have been interested in handcrafted log building for a long time. I bought many books on the subject, trying to teach myself the craft.  They all lacked info needed by the novice. I could have saved myself alot of time and money!  This is the book I was looking for!  detailed, straight forward, understandable descriptions of each step... Clear, inside information about a complicated building process.<br>  I'm confident now to practice and perfect my technique and hopefully build a log structure on some land I recently purchased. <br>Thanks Robert Chambers!</span>

                    <span>After searching fruitlessly for a competent text on log building construction, I had nearly given up. By chance, I stumbled upon "Log Construction Manual" by Robert Wood Chambers at Amazon.<br>I made the purchase, read the information and felt compelled to write a review.<br>Chambers takes the complex craft of fully scribed log construction and explains through diagrams, photos, techniques, and formulas how to successfully construct a log building. Truly a comprehensive textbook, a must for anyone planning to build a log home or cabin. <br>Also included in this book is a chapter on log building tools, some conventional, some unique to log construction, and places to purchase tools; resources, such as book and magazine reviews, log building schools and workshops, design and engineering contacts.<br>A big "thank you" to Mr. Chambers</span>
