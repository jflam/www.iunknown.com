                <span id="Label1">DYNAMIC HTML IN ACTION, SECOND EDITION, is a valuable guide for HTML/Web authors eager to get the most out of the extended interactive and multimedia abilities of Dynamic HTML version 2 (as featured in Internet Explorer 5-and possibly supported by Netscape as well). DYNAMIC HTML IN ACTION, SECOND EDITION, covers everything that makes Internet Explorer 5 the next breakthrough technology for creating dynamic Web content: Dynamic HTML, dynamic content and dynamic styles, the Internet Explorer 5 object model, new Table features, 2D positioning, and data binding. All topics are covered in clear, succinct language with plenty of sample pages on the CD to make learning these new tools as engaging and interesting as the content Web users will eventually create.</span>

                    <span>True, this is not a great reference, though the CD contains great reference material and there are www links scattered liberally throughout the text. For more general DHTML references one would do better with either Goodman's "Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide" (O'Reilly & Assoc., 1998) for a cross-platform perspective or Francis et al. "IE5 DHTML Prog. Ref. 2nd Ed." (Wrox Press, 1999) for a very IE5-centric text.<P>What this book excels at is showing you how to do stuff with DHTML, combining (Java)script-ing, CSS, and touching on XML. It doesn't go deeply into any particular subject, nor does it skim too lightly, and its "portal" approach almost guarantees there are links to more information.<P>Netscape-centric developers will find this text off-putting to offensive. This book stresses - though is not exclusive to - IE4 and 5. As Microsoft and Netscape converge on the W3C DHTML specification we can hope browser-specific DHTML books will be replaced by more standardized texts.<P>I would recommend this book to anyone who is at least slightly familiar with the technologies and wants to put them together quickly to create eye-catching sites. Its Javascript tutorial is weak - if you're not already familiar with Javascript or its siblings (JScript, ECMAScript) start elsewhere then return to this book for practical uses of Javascript.</span>

                    <span>The simple fact is: Internet Explorer 4.0 and later now owns more than 80% of the browser market. Because of this, the books focus on the browser is not necessarily a bad thing. Plus, it's a Microsoft book - anyone who buys it thinking it will cater completely to Netscape Navigator is fooling themself.<P>Eitherway, this book is amazing for people wanting to begin their quest on learning DHTML. Though I have been professionally designing web pages for years, I have been forced to focus on ASP driven pages or static HTML pages. JavaScript has consistently alluded my understanding. VBScript was easy. JavaScript has never made much sense and I have lost interest in learning it, book after book.<P>However, this book teaches you unbelievably well. I was literally JOYED to see the way that this book was explaining things to me, ONE event, one action, one attribute at a time. It was so refreshing to have things slowly doled out to you rather than be tossed in over your head, gasping for air.<P>If you don't know much about JavaScript/DHTML and are interested in learning - this is your book. Pick it up immediately. Yes, it's older, but the foundation it gives you is wonderful.</span>

                    <span>I can't believe this book was ever published. The writing is vague. If the authors/editors understood their subject matter they should be able to explain it. Very disappointing. Writing too vague for a beginner; too brief for an intermediate.</span>

                    <span>The best audience for this book is probably a beginner or intermediate web developer. It does a great job of TEACHING. It isn't a reference-it's only 500 pages and a reference that just covers scripting (which won't teach you anything) will fill well over that. It gives very good coverage of HTML and good scripting and css sections (it has two screenshots showing how all the text related css attributes are rendered in Internet Explorer and Netscape).<P> The latter part of the book is devoted to a lot of Internet Explorer specific technologies that could be of use a lot of use to people developing intranet sites.<P> This book details many features that work in Internet Explorer and not in the latest Netscape product. HOWEVER, that is to be expected since Netscape has not released a new browser in several years. The advantage of this book is that it doesn't present the user with a just one feature set-it lets the reader know what things work and what don't in each browser, although there is a focus on the Microsoft product. In some cases it even details how the Mozilla betas differ from the released Netscape browser and it mentions Opera a couple of times.</span>

                    <span>Hey dont even bother with this book. It is a complete waste of a tree unless you are a complete beginner and love Bill Gates. (cuz they will try and brainwash u). Basically, this book says here is a cool dhtml property that works in exploder but not the other ones please look at the microsoft web page or look at the cd that comes with this to see it.<P>What a pile of trash.<P>We want to be able to have a book that can use both netscape and explorer. Not say what netsape4 cant do. Anyways netscape 6 is already out in alpha and this book is completely out of date. Plus this book was written before ie5 so it doesnt even address the newest ie correctly. it was written when it was in beta and he really doesnt have a good understanding of the power. He only knows netscape 4 doesnt have it.<P>The reader is left to do all his homework going to netscapes main page to see what can work.<P>If u want to learn dhtml buy danny goodman and jeff rouyers books!</span>
