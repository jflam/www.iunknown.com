                <span id="Label1">Like Rumi and Hafiz, the name Attar conjures up images of passionate attraction to the divine. Attar was a Persian Sufi of the 12th  century and his masterpiece is <I>The Conference of the Birds</I>, an epic  allegory of the seeker's journey to God. When all the birds of the world convene  and determine that they lack a king, one bird steps forward and offers to lead  them to a great and mighty monarch. Initially excited, each bird falters in  turn, whereupon the leader admonishes them with well-targeted parables. These  pithy tales are the delight of this 4,500-line poem, translated deftly into  rhymed couplets. What is your excuse for not seeking God? Your life is fine  already? You prefer material pleasure? You are holy enough? You have pride, lack  courage, or are burdened with responsibility? Attar has an answer to encourage  you on the path to the promised land. And when you get there, the king may not  be what you'd expect, but you must make the journey to see. <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>An enjoyable read. Having no knowledge of the language in which the original was written, it's impossible to tell how true to the original the translation is, but I found this English verse rendition flowed very well.<P>The story is essentially an exemplary tale of how to lead a good, ascetic life (the denial of "the Self") and how few can actually achieve that. It is replete with illustrative yarns, as the hoopoe (the leader of the birds), counters the other birds' foibles, and their excuses not to make the journey. Therefore the theme is a familiar one - how to strive for and achieve spiritual fulfilment by use of the allegory of a difficult journey. Yet it is written with such clarity, wit and insight, it's nonetheless a refreshing read.</span>

                    <span>This book is about birds who set out on a voyage to find G'd (Simorgh). Using a number of parables and metaphors, the author uses the voyage as a process of self discovery. In the voyage, many birds fall by the wayside, while their leader questions them why they are giving up; these questions are the same questions, in theory, everyone should be asking themselves. <P>The translation is very good, though sometimes I questioned the fidelity of it, since it was rhymed in Persian and the author made it rhyme in English as well. <P>As a comparison, Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist has some similar lessons (such as seeking oneself), but Farid's work is much more subtle and interesting from the point of view of allegories and symbolism. Of course, in the end there is a surprise in both, but I will leave it to the reader to find out.</span>

                    <span>I have been a reader of this text for years, typically the C.S. Nott translation (prose style).<BR>In comparison, I find this text quite difficult to "get into", what with the problem of<BR>rhyming Persian poetry in English. In Persian, the majority of words rhyme, either in<BR>their dominant vowels or their endings, because of the way the language is<BR>constructed. Since English does not have this, there are far fewer rhymes available,<BR>and so trying to duplicate the Persian leads to either changes in the meaning, or<BR>changes in the phraseology. For those who want to read the insights contained in<BR>this book, I highly recommend a prose translation.</span>

                    <span>Fariduddin Attat is a wonderful commentator of sufi thought. In this epic poem of self actualization and self realization he reachs and touches the essence of sufic thought. The beautiful thought classically woven in the form of poetry by Attar in such a manner that one enjoys the form and contents equally. <P>In a very subtle way another book"Journey to the East" by great German novelist Hermann Hesse is a reflection on this poem, specially when thirty birds reaching destination find that Simrogh was nobody but themselves.<P>This is what its all about reaching to onself but not just like that, but through quest. This is a book very highly recomended for reading.</span>
