                    <span>I sell books on Amamzon and I was listing this book and double checking it's conditon when I became drawn into the book.<P>This is an excellent book for the history buff,school library,or for anyone who has never been to Washingtton CD.<P>The before and after pictures are especially interesting.<P>If you are planing a trip to the capitol this would be a good book to read and reread first. Then you could compare the views when you return .<P>This would give you an excellent "feel" for the changing "life" of the capitol.</span>

                    <span>Robert Cameron is undoubtedly one of the best urban aerial photographers in the country. However, the landscape of Washington has changed so dramatically in the twenty years since this book was released that anyone with a lot of knowledge about the area will be disappointed by what's missing.<BR> It does contain a wide breadth of pictures, some which are definitely extraordinary. However, the book needs to be updated in order to capture the modernization in architecture and planning that has proliferated in Washington D.C. and the surrounding area since its initial publication.</span>

                    <span>Washington, DC is an unique capital city and Robert Cameron shares his birdeye's view with us in this marvelous volume. For residents and vistors alike, this is extraordinary record of the city, particularly the juxtaposition of old and contemporary photographs. Others try to emulate Cameron in this genre, but he is the master who makes it look easy.</span>

                    <span>Above Washington, - like all of Robert Cameron's Above books - is a superb collection of historical to present day comparison photographs. The picture quality and composition is bar-none, especially for aerial photography. Any city planning or Washington D.C. buff will enjoy this book immensely. Please be advised, though: this book has not been updated in quite a while eventhough it has been reprinted many times. The most recent photographs are late 1970-'80s era pictures. Above Washington could definitely use an update. Nevertheless, it's a great D.C. history lesson and has many unique photographs of places such as the U.S. Naval Observatory where the Vice President lives, as well as an aerial view of Marine Ones parked like ducks in a row. Need good pictures for a project - Cameron's Above Washington is the way to go. Want a current picture or coffee table book - you better reevaluate.</span>
