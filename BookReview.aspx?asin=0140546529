                    <span>Originally published in 1974, "Jambo Means Hello" made waves when it first appeared. The book strives to present East African lifestyles for the viewer using a technique that produces the 24 letters of the Swahili alphabet. Each letter is the beginning of a word in Swahili, and the text and pictures illustrate how this word fits into the daily interactions of Eastern Africans. From the "A" of arusi (a wedding) to the Z of the zeze (a stringed instrument) the reader is given a series of interesting situations and illustrations.<BR><BR>Now when this book first came out it was unique in its field. Since the 1970s, however, our standards for non-fiction picture books have risen a little and "Jambo Means Hello" is not necessarily the best book of its kind anymore. Looking at it today is an interesting exercise in changing perceptions. First of all, I'd like to commend author Muriel Feelings for her incredibly informative Introduction. Producing a map of Africa that clearly delineates the countries where Swahili is the primary language, she explains about the continent, the people, and the fact that Swahili hasn't a Q or X sound. The book then enters into the letters, accompanied by Tom Feelings's pencil and ink drawings. These pictures are entirely respectful of their subjects. People, objects, and the land itself are presented beautifully here. Though the illustrations are all black and white, you do not feel the lack of color is a loss of any kind. <BR><BR>I haven't any problems with the illustrations of this book, but I do feel that the text is a bit outdated at times. First of all, the author makes rather grand sweeping statements about East Africans, lumping them all into a group and making it seem as if people from the Congo partake in the same ceremonies, customs, and dress as the people of Somalia. This is my primary problem with the book, but there are other small difficulties as well. For one thing, there aren't any signs of modernization or contemporary attitudes in this book, which is odd. Large cities and technological advances are pretty much ignored on the whole. Then there is the introduction's statement that this book is specifically for children of African ancestry, as if kids from other cultures wouldn't get anything out of this collection. <BR><BR>Still, these problems aren't huge and a little well-placed modernization and editing could eliminate them altogether. Kids reading this book will delight to recognize such Swahili words as Rafiki (friend), remembering that charming monkey from "The Lion King". They'll enjoy the elegant sweeping pictures and depictions. An enjoyable (and greatly needed) book, this is certain to continue to garner fans as the years go by. Though bigger better books exploring the nature of Africa and its inhabitants exist, I recommend you at least give a glance to the charming, "Jambo Means Hello".</span>

                    <span>This children's book, also illustrated by Tom Feelings, is an alphabet book that teaches Swahili words and African culture. With each word, a child learns more about this vibrant African culture. It was a 1975 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a children's book.</span>

                    <span>Following the idea that language cannot be separated from the culture that speaks it, this book introduces children to some basic words and customs of the people who traditionally speak Swahili. Any child interested in foreign languages, or perhaps just the names in the Lion King (taken from Swahili, Simba=lion, Rafiki=friend)will appreciate this simple introduction to another language and culture. Older children may even be motivated to learn more on their own. I highly recommend it.</span>
