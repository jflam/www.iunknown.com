                    <span>Most other reviewers of this book claim that it is an easy read. I agree, but is "easy to read" enough to recommend this book? I don't have time for "an easy read" with little value. DeMarco gives us laundry lists of project management tips that most of us already know. I could have saved myself a bunch of time if I had simply read the main character's journal entries at the end of each chapter and skipped the "novel" part.<P>Speaking of "the novel part," DeMarco doesn't pull off the combination novel/business volume well. His fictional examples were too far from reality to be useful or compelling for me. At the same time, the examples weren't far enough from reality to accomplish the goals he set out in the Preface. In the Preface, DeMarco wrote that he patterned the style of the book after the style of George Gamow, a University of Colorado physicist of the 1930's. As a method of instruction about physics, Gamow wrote a series of essays in which a fictional Mr. Tompkins wakes up in alternate universes where fundamental physical constants are dramatically changed. This vehicle worked for Gamov's objective physical constants, but it falls short in the VERY subjective world DeMarco paints for us.<P>My last complaint about this book is the advertisement it contains for iThink software. It begins in chapter 10, when Tompkins meets a man who uses iThink to create a model of project management "hunches." We are shown a screen shot of what looks like a state machine diagram with rectangles, circles and arrows going this way and that between them. Tompkins, the main character, looks at the screen and says, "It looks pretty much like what's going on inside me when I try to figure out how well the team will perform." Huh? Is Tompkins a man or a machine? I just don't buy it. What are we being sold here?<P>Don't let the high marks from other reviewers fool you. This book does not have high value. If what you really want is "an easy read," find yourself a decent novel. If what you really want is a book about project management, try the books other reviewers have recommended.</span>

                    <span>This book follows a project manager (Webster Tompkins) from the time he becomes a "ReSOE" (Released to Seek Opportunities Elsewhere) from the Big Telephone and Telegraph copmpany. Tompkins is made an offer he can't refuse to take the roll of project manager of a seemingly un-doable software development task.<P>Tom DeMarco manages to squeeze a tremendous amount or project management advice into this 300 page novel. I was hooked by the end of the first chapter. This is a great read for anyone who is tired of reading management handbooks or software development manuals, but still wants to stay in the same area, like a lawyer reading the new Grisham novel. It's a perfect book for nightime or airplane reading.</span>

                    <span>This is perhaps the only management novel for IT. In the vein of "the Goal" by Goldratt, Tom DeMarco preaches the gospel of good project management. The ideas on staffing, conflict resolution and managing to deadlines are very helpful. The challenge is that the novel format could and should provide insight into the conflicts dealing with situations that are not ideal. In reality, we are left with great ideas, but a lost opportunity to highlight how to deal with the difficulties of making them happen.</span>

                    <span>I am certified professional with several years in this profession, this is amongst my favorite - if not the favorite book.<P>This book, indeed very interesting novel on Project Management, helps one understand the 'Art' part of the profession. The book's main theme is managing project in grey area, from start to finish. Unlike other books which discuss different elements and tools of project management, this book elaborates inner self traits required for successful delivery. Mr. Demarco not only identifies but gives working examples of the key traits for successful delivery. He identifies building trust, having big heart, good brain, dare and good risk sense, nose for smelling who/when is *&&#@!..... and lastly collaboration, as THE key traits of 'good project manager'. Then he blends these with general tools of PM in a storyline . If one is looking for science part of the subject, tools, what to do when, then this is not that kind of book. There are hundreds of books on the profession you can easily find to read about what, when, how....but this is about 'you' and 'why'. <P>You cannot highlight what it is that you need beyond management tools and techniques - unless you write in a narrative manner and develop scenarios. Story format has made this possible. <P>To Summarize: you may read many good books on the subject, which discuss phases, input/output of different processes and management tools, but you cannot feel it in your bones what the project management is - unless you read this beautiful novel.</span>

                    <span>If you think that you can apply Tom DeMarco's novel knowledge only to the software engineering field, you will get surprised how management is the same across all fields, including software development. This is my favorite quote from this book. "It's not what you don't know what kills you, but what you know and isn't so."</span>
