                    <span>Relevant and interesting .Net book that emphasizes "why" rather than "how" while privileging concepts over code snippets.   
<br />
<br />The material Pattison and Hummel cover is relevant to all dotnet developers because it revolves around the building of object oriented component-based applications without emphasis to any particular app framework (whether console, asp.net &or windows forms/"smart client" apps). The result is a book that's some what akin to a generic re-usable class (that's a good thing)
<br />
<br />Building Apps and Components W/ VB.Net covers the things other books either: ignore, assume you're familiar with, or provide code samples without explaining the context (this observation extends to the MS web application exam too)
<br /> 
<br />Things like: 
<br />
<br />What a type is 
<br />Shared class members VS Instance members 
<br />Inheritance
<br />Writing abstract base classes
<br />Scoping considerations 
<br />Polymorphism 
<br />Interfaces 
<br />Event-based programming 
<br />Garbage Collection and Object life-time 
<br />Values and Objects (Structures Vs Classes)
<br />etc
<br />
<br />I concur with the programmer who wrote the following in his review of the book " if you can't explain straight out to someone what boxing or polymorphism means now, you'll be a better programmer for reading this book."

It does so with clear short sentences, great and relatively simple examples, appropriate diagrams, no skipping around while learning, and downloadable projects. Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>I toyed with the idea of writing a really long and detailed review about the content of this book (like so many you see on Amazon), but in a nutshell, this book is a masterpiece, it's what all technical books should aspire to be, comprehensive, thorough, mercifully free of unnecessary flab, and deeply intelligent in its choice of concise and ingenious examples. 
<br />
<br />It left me with the feeling that I'd been hit by a truck with the word 'clarity' emblazoned on the side.
<br />you won't be a .Net guru afterwards because .Net is Massive! 
<br />
<br />but...
<br />
<br />it is in my view the best 'foundation' book of any kind I've ever had the pleasure to read, read it and then read Balena, Esposito et al, but I can't emphasize enough read this first, it is hearteningly and informatively brilliant. You WILL understand Visual Basic .net after reading it, after that go on to books that exploit specific namespaces like ADO.net, ASP.net, winforms, XML web services etc.. this book is not about any of that it's about the compiler, assemblies , types and the framework, the plumbing! this is anatomy class, surgery should come later, and as these things go, it's 'the business'! 
<br />It just goes to show that there are still people in this world who really do care about what they put their name to.
<br />
<br />'****New Addition (10 months on, I've read it again)
<br />Upon re-reading the book I was struck but how it was even more useful 2nd time round, but also particularly by how economical and highly informative the comments inside the code are. They are magnificent. I've found it very useful when the author is illustrating a particular point, to show for example, the return value of a method call as a comment to the right. When the main point of the example is 'watch out, this does something you don't expect' the code becomes complete, you can understand it without having to run it. I do think however that you understand code much better if you do run it. The point I'm making is that writing great and very succint comments is an art, and one I think the authors have completely mastered. You can read the book in transit and still make sense of all the examples.

                    <span>As a college instructor, I have literally reviewed more than a dozen books on the Visual Basic .NET language. This books is far above its peers. It is well-organized, thorough, insightful, and clearly presents is topics. I can think of no better resource for experienced developers who need to transition to Visual Studio .NET and Visual Basic .NET.<p>With coverage of essential topics such as the Common Language Runtime, the .NET Framework, changes in object-oriented programming, and managing and deploying assemblies, this text covers EVERY essential change in Visual Basic .NET<p>That having been said, this book is not intended for new Visual Basic developers. You will not find the introductory material necessary to get you up to speed in Visual Basic programming. A familiarity with previous Visual Basic versions and a rock-solid understanding of object-oriented programming theory and methodology is essential.<p>This is a hard-core professional reference, ready to give experienced programmers a jump-start into Visual Basic .NET, and its the best professional coverage of changes in .NET that I've found out there.</span>

                    <span>I was looking at this book the other day and wasn't sure about it.  I've recently picked up a few copies of Addison-Wesley's .NET Developer's series and really loved them, but thought "Oh boy, another VB.NET component book"  But, when I looked at the cover, Francesco Balena and Rockford Lhotka both wrote parts of the Foreword and couldnt' have said nicer things.  Well, I have everything that either of them have written and respect both of those authors blindly.  If Balena or Lhotka say this book is good, it's good.  Well, it's fabulous.  Pattison is nothing short of amazing.  The level of detail he covers things in is almost scarry.  If you want to understand your art, and your art is VB.NET, this book is for you..  I couldn't find something to criticize about this book if you paid me to.  Great examples, even better explanations and an author that can communicate to anyone - and can get his point across very succinctly!<p>So, now I've now added Pattison to my list of Balena, Appleman, MacDonald and Lhotka as my favorite VB authors!</span>
