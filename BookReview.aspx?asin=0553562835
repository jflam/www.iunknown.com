                    <span>I honestly wondered at first if the Wal-Mart story would keep my attention, but I figured that since I had an interest in business I might as well give it a try.  I'm not sorry that I did. Sam Walton's story is a marvelous depiction of the American dream. As you may have read in other reviews, it's a very good rags-to-riches kind of a story. I found it to be entertaining and even a little thought provoking.
<br />
<br />The book focuses on the rise of Wal-Mart and the ingredients of its success. If you are contemplating on ever going into business, this book is well worth the read. Sam has a very blunt and matter-of-fact way of saying things that I find particularly refreshing. He doesn't spend a bunch of time saying, "look at us!" but rather points out the challenges and responsibilities of having the largest retail chain in the United States.
<br />
<br />While it's interesting to read about the competition with Kmart and the adventures of growing a business, I found his last few chapters very interesting.  In the end he discusses issues regarding the country, its growth and its education. He also tackles a lot of the Wal-Mart's criticism of being bad for small businesses. If I have a complaint it's that sometimes I feel he repeats himself too much. The content sometimes overlaps so much that you feel that you've been reading the same stuff forever. That's really the only thing I can think of though.  All in all, it's worth your time.

                    </div>
                    <span>A well-written book with lots of insights in folksy style.  My motivation to read this book came after reading Built To Last (by Jim Collins) wherein WalMart is one of the great companies with a strongly in-grained "core" of serving the customers. Of course, Sam Walton's book predates Built to Last and is actually one of the sources for Jim Collin's well researched book.  
<br />
<br />The main theme of this  book:
<br />1. Sam's initial life - learning the value of dollar amidst great depression, working as a newspaper delivery boy, showing initial salesmanship
<br />
<br />2. Developing passion for retail; though I could not find any reason for why retail, why not something else; perhaps it was evolved from his initial adventures .
<br />
<br />3. A passion for delivering best quality goods at lowest prices.  Through my personal visits in Walmart tend to say - ok quality goods at lowest prices. 
<br />
<br />4. Biggest insights come in how he ran the company:
<br />	- very hands-on and detail-oriented style; going over the store figures every week he was still talking with a store manager when terminally ill
<br />	- hard-work; there is no replacement for it
<br />	- building the team by choosing the right people 
<br />	- building a culture that cares for people and creates a camaraderie (think cult-like cultures!)
<br />	- building "partnerships" with associates
<br />	- caring for his associates and for his customers while still delivering great profits (think genius of "AND" from Jim Collins)
<br />	 
<br />These practices and principles are probably not specific to retail; if these are applied, correctly, to any business (or any organization), it seems you can build a phenomenal organization. 
<br />
<br />The book is very straight and honest; nothing beats a person writing his memoirs in the last year of his life!
<br />
<br />Like most autobiography's it is one sided.  Very little critique!

                    <span>This book is so bad, it's almost not even worth writing about.  The book proports to shine some sunny light on the man solely responisble for making minimum wage and "full time" work (often defined as 20-30 hours) popular in keeping lower-class America in its place.  Look no further for an account of the man focused on plumbing the depths of the dark heart of corporate greed.  You'd be better off reading Barbara Ehrenreich's book, Nickel and Dimed.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>First off, this is a very strong story of a man and a business.  Walton does a nice job of telling a clear, concise story about how he built the business of Wal Mart.  It's very enlightening to hear him admit with pride that he invented very few of the ideas that made the store such a success, instead borrowing the best ideas from every store he visited (and he visited a lot).  
<br />
<br />Secondly, this book contains a valuable example of how capitalism forces the evolution - for better or worse - of industries.  Walton takes the reader from the days of the small-town five and dime all the way through the mega Wal Marts of today.  It's a valuable read for anyone interested in business.
<br />
<br />Third, reading "Made in America" provides the reader with some important context for considering all of the attacks on Wal Mart in the popular press.  You get to see that Wal Mart was built with really good intentions and that even though not everything born of Wal Mart's rise to dominance is an unmitigated good, it has done a lot of positive things for American consumers.  That's really valuable because Wal Mart has become a bit of an unequivocal evil in the modern press and that simply isn't an even-handed treatment of the subject.
<br />
<br />Highly recommended for those who would like to understand the motivations behind Wal Mart being what it is today and a great business story to boot.</span>
