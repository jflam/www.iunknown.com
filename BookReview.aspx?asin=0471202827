                <span id="Label1">The first book to cover Agile Modeling, a new modeling technique created specifically for XP projects eXtreme Programming (XP) has created a buzz in the software development community-much like Design Patterns did several years ago. Although XP presents a methodology for faster software development, many developers find that XP does not allow for modeling time, which is critical to ensure that a project meets its proposed requirements. They have also found that standard modeling techniques that use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) often do not work with this methodology. In this innovative book, Software Development columnist Scott Ambler presents Agile Modeling (AM)-a technique that he created for modeling XP projects using pieces of the UML and Rational's Unified Process (RUP). Ambler clearly explains AM, and shows readers how to incorporate AM, UML, and RUP into their development projects with the help of numerous case studies integrated throughout the book.<br>    * AM was created by the author for modeling XP projects-an element lacking in the original XP design<br>    * The XP community and its creator have embraced AM, which should give this book strong market acceptance<br>    Companion Web site at www.agilemodeling.com features updates, links to XP and AM resources, and ongoing case studies about agile modeling.</span>

                    <span>Good book with lots of behind the scenes process info about how to implement agile modeling techniques. If you are looking for step by step instructions to modeling or how to model, look elsewhere. It doesn't cover specific modeling, but techniques. Some of the techniques are common sense, but there were lots of suggestions of how to apply them in a difficult political environment. I did not completely agree with the often repeated <br>statement that unless you apply all of the techniques you cannot truly claim agile modeling success, which I think is a somewhat arrogant statement. Agile modeling is a huge cultural change and implementing as much as possible, if not all, is still a great idea.</span>

                    <span>For those few places left that steep themselves in documentation and don't have a legally-required reason to do so (do they exist?), this book should help motivate why producing too much documentation and doing too much modeling up front can hurt rather than help. Even for a company that sees itself as lightweight, he's got some rough assessments you can do to see if you're overdoing things, which were relevant even where I work.<p>The only bad thing is that it was a very theory and ideal oriented book. It didn't contain concrete examples of what Agile Modeling would look like on a real project, how it would feel, and how what models were produced would evolve. This made it a bit difficult to verify my interpretation of the book.</span>

                    <span>I work at a consulting firm where the management lies and rips off the customer all the time. The day someone brought in this book and start talking about agile modeling, the managers were scared. A meeting was called and this book was banned. The reason is simple: If everyone practice what this book is advocating, the business of charging the customers like hell by purchasing expensive modeling software, creating tons of documentations without doing any real work, and always prolonging the project will end sooner than the owners getting their BMWs and McMasions.<br>The simple fact that this little book caused headaces to the criminal minded management team tells me how great it is! I wish I can give it ten starts!</span>

                    <span>One of the values of the agile movement is simplicity, which the author kindly spends about two pages explaining it to us mere mortals. And it seems only logical that this high principle would also imply brevity. Unfortunately, this book in itself is a violation of that principle. The only useful lesson that one can possibly distill from this three hundred and fifty pages tome is the following: Keep it simple, lose it if you don't use it, and don't hesitate to ditch your expensive modeling software when it becomes too restrictive. A wonderful and very effective advice if I may add, but there is definitely no need for an entire book to explain it.<p>This book is neither a modeling tutorial nor an introduction. And if you have had any decent amount of practical modeling experience then chances are you have already learned the above lesson. As such, the book fails to hit the mark for both experts and novice modelers. Nevertheless, the lesson it contains is important, thus the two stars. The book itself, however, receives a flat zero rating.</span>

                    <span>An adept application of common sense--and the author's significant experience--to the use of models in software development.<p>A model can be almost anything that developers make to describe the software that they build--just like an architect's drawings.<p>A given software development effort might call for any number of different types of models including data models, class models, sequence diagrams, dataflow diagrams, statechart diagrams, etc.  The set of models used on any particular project will depend partly on the nature of the project and partly on the preferred methodology of the software developers.<p>Agile Modeling (AM) is not itself a software development methodology.  It is a collection of principles and practices to follow when using models to develop software according to a methodology like Rational Unified Process (RUP) or eXtreme Programming (XP).  Many of the practices derive from an application of XP concepts.<p>AM challenges a number of practices widely followed (or at least preached) in organizations developing software:<br>  1.  Specializing personnel in producing a single type of model<br>  2.  Dedicating work sessions to producing a single type of model<br>  3.  Saving models after the software is developed<br>  4.  Keeping models up-to-date during and after the development project<br>  5.  Using sophisticated software to assist in modeling<br>  6.  Finishing models before coding software<p>AM does not in all cases prohibit these practices, but it emphasizes that the purpose of a software development project is to develop software--not just to develop models.  The practices of AM help to keep models in their proper subordinate relation to the working software that is the true goal of any development project.<p>People with more luck than experience might doubt the need for agile modeling.  Please accept from a reader with much more experience than luck an assurance that the need is great.  This reader has personally witnessed development projects undertake the costly construction of models having at best a tenuous relation to the software to be developed.<p>It should in fact come as no surprise.  Who would not agree that it is easier to waste other people's money than to abandon one's own obsessions?<p>At any rate, Mr. Ambler tries to keep us on track with this excellent book, challenging us to use models but to stay focused on software.<p>Different readers are likely to be challenged to different degrees by AM's various principles and practices.  This reader easily accepted, for example, the practice "Create Several Models in Parallel," counseling us to construct multiple model types simultaneously and to eschew the antipatterns of "Single Artifact Developers" and "Single Artifact Modeling Sessions" (pp. 47-50).<p>The principle "Maximize Stakeholder Investment" proved more challenging.  It counsels that project stakeholders (i.e. the businesspeople commissioning the development project)--not software developers--ought to decide whether to develop software documentation (p. 37).  True, the stakeholders pay the bills, but architects and accountants also have paying clients who are nevertheless not able to dictate everything about their work.  Clearly software development should have professional standards whose suspension may not be commanded even by a paying client.<p>Another challenge for this reader:  "Agile modelers typically do not bother to distinguish between the different "flavors" of modeling, . . . (p. 252)."  Here Mr. Ambler is writing about what Martin Fowler calls "perspectives"--conceptual, specification, and implementation--that a model might take on its subject.  These perspectives correspond to the business analysis, system analysis, and system design phases of a software development project.<p>In his "UML Distilled," Mr. Fowler differs sharply from Mr. Ambler:  "Understanding perspective is crucial to both drawing and reading class diagrams.  . . . it is very important to separate the specification perspective and the implementation perspective (p. 52)."<p>Or does he?  Mr. Ambler hedges his position in the very same sentence:  ". . . they just model appropriately as the situation calls for."  Now, how can one "model appropriately" if one does not first "bother to distinguish"?<p>Elsewhere too, the advice of AM can seem equivocal (or is it "nuanced"?).   The practice "Collective Ownership" allows everyone on a project to work on any of the project's models.  This "power to the people" is however greatly diluted by the practice "Model with Others," prohibiting anyone from modeling alone.  Further dilution appears in the case study, where it is recognized that one would be foolish to work on a database design without consulting "Brendan, the database administration (DBA) expert on the team (p. 288)."<p>It is interesting to compare Mr. Ambler's populist principles for teamwork with the more elitist principles of Frederick Brooks in "The Mythical Man-Month."  Mr. Brooks begins his third chapter by citing the "wide productivity variations between good programmers and poor ones."  He derives from this observation a software development organization patterned after a surgical team--with one operating surgeon and a small flock of assistants.<p>Although starting from opposite principles, Brooks and Ambler finish peculiarly close in their team-building practices.  A la XP, Brooks's ideal team pairs the "surgeon" with a colleague equally gifted though less experienced.  Inversely, Ambler approaches Brooks by listing in Chapter 12 the qualities of superior software developers.  "Everyone can learn from everyone else" is one of the "supplementary principles" of agile modeling, but clearly some people have less to learn than others. <p>Mr. Ambler seems well read.  He frequently cites related books throughout the text, adding a special recommendation here and there.  One of these recommendations surprised this reader, who was astounded that Mr. Ambler found "UML for Database Design" by Messrs. Naiburg and Maksimchuk "a good read (p. 170)."  You may find this reader's differing opinion filed with Amazon.com<p>Our difference on this small point serves only to highlight the strength of this reader's recommendation.<p>This is a provocative and well-reasoned explication.  Agile Modeling will leave its mark.</span>
