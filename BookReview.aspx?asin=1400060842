                    <span>This slim volume was too Ramboesque by half, and it wasn't long before all the overtly macho bearhug-my-beer-buddies posturing made me feel like I was trapped in a Chuck Norris film.  Stick to those "Walker, Texas Ranger" reruns instead....</span>

                    <span>Rather than be long winded, as a public librarian let me just say this book is worth your time to read whether you are a non-fiction fan, or are inclined to novels.  This book is a can't miss production, well written, poignant...alas, I am not at a loss for adjectives.  Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>A "great" book written by a true American hero.  Queen exposes these bikers for what they are, criminals, family men, brothers, motorcycle enthusiasts and, most of all, too human.  While some are absolutely evil, most seem to be guys who have been lured by the outlaw lifestyle and all its rewards without willing to accept its punishments as well.  Remember, the motorcycle gang came into being primarily with true American heroes of WWII, looking for adventure after losing the pumped up lifestyle of war.  William Queen goes under cover and remarkably infiltrates the Mongrol MC.  Ultimately he becomes "patched in", a full fledged member of this criminal enterprise.  The stories he tells are heartbreaking at times, brutal at others, but all the while Queen never lost sight of his goal of exposing them for what they do.  He experiences what has become the all to often dilemma for these type of law enforcement agents.  These are indeed his brothers and he is knowingly working to put them in prison for the rest of thier lives.  Queen taps into his own sense of betrayal, outrage, sadness, and fear, as the investigation continues.  Quite a remarkable investigation and a remarkable book.</span>

                    <span>As the ex-wife of one of the main characters in the book, I can tell the readers that William Queen told the whole truth and nothing but the truth...it was 100% accurate and in no way exaggerated. Only on a few minor occasions did his recollection of events differ slightly from mine, but only the smallest and most unimportant of details. This book was amazing and well written - good job Billy! I cannot describe the feelings that ran through me as I read this book, as I read page after page of events that I remember like yesterday. I was also taken back to the phone call I got from Billy on May 19th, 2000, telling me who he was and what was happening. How I didn't belong with those people. Even though I had to re-live all the feelings of hurt and betrayal I felt the day my life changed forever, I am thankful now to be out of that life and where I am today. Not only was this man a hero in the eyes of many, but he changed my life. Billy, in the event you ever read this review, I just wanted you to know that.

                    <span>As gripping as any well written crime novel this real life account of an undercover ATF agent's infiltration into a terrifying motorcycle gang is the type of book you just can't put down.
<br />  The book offers unique, almost anthropological, insights into a modern day motorcycle gang while at the same time exploring the toll the assignment took on the author himself.
<br />  I recommend this book to all fans of true crime as well as those who enjoy and intense white knuckle ride.
<br />Destined to be a classic.</span>
