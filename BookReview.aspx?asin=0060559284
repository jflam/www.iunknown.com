                <span id="Label1">Dick Morris is on a tirade in <I>Off With Their Heads</I>--and that&#146;s good news. For as an experienced political consultant who has worked with both Democrats and Republicans at the highest levels of government, he knows what he&#146;s talking about. As a result, there is much to learn from this detailed book, regardless of whether one may agree with his conclusions. Morris begins by railing against the established news media for showing blatant liberal bias and for irresponsibly undermining the war on terror as the Bush administration is waging it. With good reason, as he illustrates in many examples, he advises citizens to rely on a wider variety of sources for information and to approach the media in general with far more skepticism. (Presumably this includes his current employer, the Fox News Channel.)  </p> Morris&#146; hit list is extensive, and he spares nothing in his attacks. There is a particularly fascinating chapter on Bill Clinton in which he declares that "All our terrorist problems were born during the Clinton years." Though he praises the former President&#146;s achievements on many domestic issues, he accuses him of utter negligence in terms of national security and foreign policy. In explaining exactly why, he also offers fascinating insights into Clinton&#146;s character and approach to policy-making that only an insider could supply. He also targets outspoken leftist Hollywood elites and crooked CEOs. Other chapters deal with the realignment of political districts and the power it affords incumbents, governors who failed to use the massive tobacco settlement for the slated purpose of funding anti-smoking campaigns, and the plight of 3.5 million nursing home residents. He saves special venom for his assessment of France. </p> Morris does not accuse his opponents of treason or even a lack of patriotism, only of being wrong and misguided. He is aggressive without being vicious and he backs up every claim he makes--two things that put him ahead of most other political analysts in the media (in addition to his work on Fox News, he is also a columnist for the <I>New York Post</I>. A well-informed and thoughtfully argued book delivered with force. <I>--Shawn Carkonen</I></span>

                    <span>I enjoyed reading this book.  I think Morris has a number of good points to make.  I didn't always agree with the author, but I still like this book.
<br />
<br />Morris starts by pointing out that the New York Times is untrustworthy.  Did he just now realize this?  Anyway, he shows that its polling methods are biased, confusing people on all sides of issues.  And worse, that it pays for interviews and scoops by pulling punches.
<br />
<br />Now, we were attacked by terrorists on 9/11.  Why do the terrorists hate us?  Morris says it is simple.  We have freedom of religion and speech.  And we have rights for women, Jews, and other minorities.
<br />
<br />I think that we need to admit that there are people who say that we're forgetting poverty, despair, and American support for foreign despots.  Obviously, poverty is bad.  Despair is bad.  We ought not promote either.  And we aren't helping matters when we support dictators in an attempt to have "stability."  But I feel these are not the main reasons for why we were attacked.  I think that our perceived support for Israel proves it.  Israel is not a dictatorship.  I think complaints about our support for Israel tend to make Morris' point.
<br />
<br />Of course, Morris has plenty to say about these issues in this book.  And he discusses at length claims by others that the war on terror is racist and an excuse to grab Iraqi oil.  And that we should change our policy, and appease the United Nations and support Arab terror when it is against Israel.  Morris replies that the issue is not racism, but terrorism, and some profiling is indeed needed.  As well as that Israel clearly wants to be left in peace, and Arabs are the ones initiating the violence in the Levant.
<br />
<br />The author discusses France and its reaction to terror.  France strongly favors appeasement, and Morris says that this is likely in response to the terrible casualties it suffered in World War I.  
<br />
<br />What about the United Nations?  Morris simply wants us to avoid it at least as long as France has a veto.  I certainly would not say this myself.  I'd get rid of the UN entirely.
<br />
<br />There is an interesting chapter on Enron and its significance.  And one on nursing homes.  And one on reducing tobacco sales.  And there is one on how a couple of states (Iowa and Arizona) are no longer gerrymandering their congressional districts!  If all states did that, it would refranchise us voters.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book.

                    <span>Dick Morris' "Off With Their Heads" is a collection of chapters that are more actually opinion columns that belong on a blog (but a blog worth browsing) than a hardcover book. The writing is less sophisticated than Morris' New York Post entries, and by far the weakest parts are those dedicated to combining the chapters into a common theme. That includes the insipid title and awful book cover.
<br /> 
<br />Few of the writers that criticize either Bush or Clinton have the insider's perspective like Dick Morris. As noted before, the best bits come from anecdotes inside the Clinton White House (Clinton's unwillingness to confront Sandy Berger, veto-but-not-a-veto of the Dodd bill, and to top it all, Jimmy Carter's absurd takeover of the talks with North Korea). Morris gives us the impression that Clinton had his strengths, but his scandals and lapses in moral conviction caught to him and handicapped his authority. 
<br />
<br />To Morris' credit, the only direct comparison made between Bush (43) and Clinton is the willingness of Bush to confront the enemies of America. Other comparisons, I'm sure will be the topic of future books.
<br />
<br />Dick Morris' book on the crimes of the 1990's seems a little dated and reads like it was written for less than sophisticated readers (like Goldberg's "Bias"). Hence, the three stars. I still recommend it for those curious about how the events (and non-events) of the Nineties led to the world of 2005 (not to mention 2001).</span>

<br />  This is an excellent book.I don't know too much about Morris.This isn't surprising since we can't get FOX News here in Canada.He does a great job of showing the reasons for much that is wrong in America,and Canada,today.The left wing bias of Newspapers like NY Times,TV Network News like ABC,NBC,CBS and CNN is rampant He reveals the failures to take action against Terrorism for years preceeding 9/11,the assinine pronouncements of the entertainment community,France,gerrymandering,corporate corruption,and a few other things.
<br /> In Canada,our political spectrum runs from socialist to liberal with little room for anything center or conservative thinking.There is talk of changing the balance;they may start allowing Al-Jazerra in,but I hold little hope for FOX News.
<br />  Morris has done a good job of showing how these problems have developed and brings back to memory many things.I find it hard to fault what he says;he's only stating the facts.Though there are many very negative reviews here,I don't see many disputing what he says.Instead, they attack him.
<br />  Personally, it's very sad for me to see the Anti-Americanism of so many in my country,particularly that on the part of the Government.Our government continues to snub the requests of the best friend our country has ever had while pandering up to France.Like they'll be there when we need them.
<br />  This left-wing thinking has proven wrong for over 70 years,and a failure everywhere embraced.That is not my opinion,the facts speak for themselves.This is what is what Morris is showing in the book.If you don't agree,just look where it has been tried and you'll see where this anti- americanism comes from.The one thing leftists can't stand is success;it negates their reason for being. 
<br /> America has got to stay the course and be the becon for freedom everywhere.The UN,ACLU,Appeasement,Apologists and Leftists are part of the problem and thus cannot be the hope for the future.
<br /> God Bless America!</span>

                    <span>Dick Morris is a man of God, as he tells us on page 16 of his new book, "Off With Their Heads: Liberal Bastard Commie Traitors, and Their Ilk." He tells us that when he worked for the Democrats, he was asked to help them win elections, and it seemed he was working for the democrats, but in hindsight, clearly Dick wasn't helping.
<br />
<br />But the heart of this book is Chapter 7, "The Liberals are Running Amok in the Zoo." And it's true, too, as I know a few liberals, and I've seen them at the zoo. But it may be that the Zoo is a metaphor for Congress, and I was misunderstanding Dick. So in that case, I haven't actually seen the liberals running amok there, since I don't get C-Span. Well, OK, I get C-Span, but I don't watch it - do you? It's very boring. But maybe if the liberals are running amok there, it's not as boring as I thought, so maybe I should go watch some. Hold on....
<br />
<br />Nope, it's as boring as I thought, no liberals running amok there, just Rick Santorum ranting about farm animal subsidies.
<br />
<br />So Dick's book is good. So good, it found a publisher. Even though the liberals running the media tried to get this book silenced. But they didn't succeed. And for that we can thank George W. Bush. Yes, that's right, the President of the United States personally called publishers on Dick's behalf and got this  very important book published. So thank you George, and thank you Dick too.
<br />
<br />I know this was not one of my more normal reviews, but I hope it was helpful to you anyway. It was helpful to me.

                    <span>I often contend that there are two sides to every side, if not
<br />more . . . that is why I so much enjoyed reading OFF WITH THEIR
<br />HEADS (see also Section 11) by Dick Morris, the Fox News Channel 
<br />political analyst and onetime campaign advisor to President Bill Clinton.
<br />
<br />It opened my eyes to many things that took place both when
<br />Clinton was in the White House and, also, afterwards, as a result
<br />of his policies . . . but what I really liked about the book was that it
<br />attempted to show both the bad, and there was a lot of it, and
<br />the good . . . where Clinton does deserve praise, such as in
<br />his handling of the tobacco industry, Morris gives him appropriate
<br />credit . . . he does the same with Bush, mostly praising him--yet
<br />knocking him on how he has handled certain things such as
<br />the nursing home crisis.
<br />
<br />Some parts dragged, as in when the author criticized what he 
<br />calls the Hollywood apologists . . . these are the stars who
<br />constantly speak out on matters they know nothing about . . . I 
<br />could have done with a lot less than 42 pages on that 
<br />subject . . . however, his report on France really helped me
<br />understand that subject a whole lot better.
<br />
<br />This book seemed to be well-researched . . . that said, it
<br />got me thinking, which is always a good thing!
<br />
<br />There were numerous passages that caught my attention;
<br />among them:
<br />
<br />Three of the 9/11 hijackers had been pulled over by traffic cops in the
<br />months before 9/11. Had the drivers' license proposal been accepted,
<br />we might have sent them packing to the Middle East before they had
<br />their chance to fly airplanes into our buildings. In April 2001-five months
<br />before 9/11-Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the hijackers, was 
<br />stopped by police near Miami for driving without a license. He was
<br />summoned to appear in court, never showed up, a bench warrant was
<br />issued, and the matter ended. Had the motor vehicle/INS/FBI interface
<br />been functioning at that time, the traffic cop would have discovered
<br />that Atta was in the country illegally, his visa having expired in
<br />January 2001. Atta would have been arrested on the spot and bound
<br />over to the INS for deportation. He might not have been in the United
<br />States to lead the 9/11 hijackers on their grisly mission.
<br />
<br />Bush went to Congress to ask for approval of our mission in
<br />Afghanistan to retaliate against, and try to capture, bin Laden. He
<br />also asked Congress for approval of a war in Iraq and got it.
<br />Bill Clinton, by contrast, sought no approval for any of his raids on
<br />Iraq, nor for his strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan. Not that he
<br />should have, but Bush went the extra mile to consult Congress,
<br />a mile that the law didn't require. The provisions of the War Powers
<br />Act specifically give the president the full power to commit forces
<br />to battle without asking congressional approval for ninety days,
<br />after which he is obliged to ask if he still wants to keep the forces
<br />in combat. But Bush chose to ask first--twice.  
<br />
<br />As Enron's auditor, Andersen was expected to be objective
<br />and impartial. But the firm was heavily dependent on consulting fees
<br />from Enron. (In 2001, for example, Andersen was paid $27 million by
<br />Enron for consulting services and $25 million for its audits.) Hiring such
<br />a firm for this kind of double duty is a bit like hiring your IRS agent as
<br />your personal accountant: He'd inevitably be torn between his desire
<br />to collect taxes from you, and his wish to continue to get your fees for 
<br />his accounting services.</span>
