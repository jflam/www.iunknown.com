                    <span>As a long time Phillies fan, I've often wondered what happened to many of my favorite players from years past.  Mr. Zimniuch did a wonderful job of researching the post-Phillies careers of so many beloved Phillies players.  I'd definitely recommend this book to any Phillies fan. </span>

                    <span>Book offers little in terms of new information. Much of research could have been accomplished without an interview. Profiles seem to have been chosen randomly. This is a read for those who have a passing interest in Philadelphia baseball. </span>

                    <span>Phillies Where Have You Gone brings back wonderful baseball memories from as far back as the Whiz Kids team of 1950. Many players are included, some were stars, some weren't. But they all played for the Phillies and have done something of interest. It's fun to find out what happened to them after their baseball careers ended.<p>If you like baseball, you'll like this book. If you love baseball, you'll love this book and wish it was bigger.</span>
