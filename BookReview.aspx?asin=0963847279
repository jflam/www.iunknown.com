                <span id="Label1">Kay Johnson has done groundbreaking research on abandonment and adoption in China. In Wanting a Daughter, Needing a Son, Johnson untangles the complex interactions between these social practices and the government&#146;s population policies. She also documents the many unintended consequences, including the overcrowding of orphanages that led China to begin international adoptions.   <P>Those touched by adoption from China want to know why so many healthy infant girls are in Chinese orphanages. This book provides the most thorough answer to date. Johnson&#146;s research overturns stereotypes and challenges the conventional wisdom on abandonment and adoption in modern China.   <P>Certainly, as Johnson shows, many Chinese parents feel a great need for a son to carry on the family name and to care for them in their old age. At the same time, the government&#146;s strict population policy puts great pressure on parents to limit births. As a result, some parents are able to obtain a son only by resorting to illegal behavior, such as "overquota" births and female infant abandonment.   <P>Yet the Chinese today value daughters more highly than ever before. As many of Johnson&#146;s respondents put it, "A son and a daughter make a family complete." How can these seemingly contradictory trends--the widespread desire for a daughter as well as a son, and the revival of female infant abandonment--be happening in the same place at the same time? Johnson looks at abandonment together with two other practices: population planning and adoption. In doing so, she reveals all three in a new light.   <P>Johnson shows us that a rapidly changing culture in late twentieth-century China hastened a positive revaluation of daughters, while new policies limiting births undercut girls&#146; improving status in the family. Those policies also revived and exacerbated one of the worst aspects of traditional patriarchal practices: the abandonment of female infants.   <P>Yet Chinese parents are not literally forced to abandon female infants in order to have a son. While birth-planning enforcement can be coercive, parents who abandon are rarely prosecuted. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Chinese parents informally adopt female foundlings and raise them as their own. Ironically, as Johnson shows, in some places adoptive parents are more likely than abandoning parents to incur fines and discrimination.   <P>In addressing all these issues, Johnson brings the skills of a China specialist who has spent over a decade researching her subject. She also brings the concerns of an adoptive parent who hopes that this book might help others find answers to the question, What can we tell our children about why they were abandoned and why they were available for international adoption?</span>

                    <span>Kay Johnson has written that rare book-a detailed look at and analysis of Chinese governmental policy that tells you what actually happens as a result of that policy. This book is important, not only to adoptive families, but also to those who study China and try to understand the real life implications for policies that affect the world's most populous country.<P>For adoptive families, Kay Johnson has provided an invaluable insight into the circumstances that led to children being available for foreign families. Stripped of the emotional overlay that accompanies so many books about adoption, Kay Johnson fearlessly examines her own preconceptions to get closer to the truth by talking to birth parents, spending time with orphanage officials and pouring over statistics. Kay Johnson shows us what happened, what changed and what could change in the future.<P>While I personally hope that there will be an international adoption program in place for many years, I am also respectful of Kay Johnson's belief that children are best off being adopted in their birth countries. The children in China's orphanages have been helped enormously by both the international adoption program and by better domestic adoption policies. Kay Johnson, almost alone of the authors and journalists who write about Chinese adoption, recognizes the contributions of the adoptive families to the orphanages as well as recognizing other contributions that have dramatically improved the care of children whose welfare is overseen by the orphanages.<P>This book offers a unique insight both for those who erroneously leap on the orphanages as a token of the depravity of the Chinese and for those whose choice to adopt in China has given them a life-altering link to a country halfway around the globe.<P>Every adoptive parent should take the opportunity this book provides to understand more fully the lives of their children before those children belonged to an adoptive family. A lot of this book is surprising and unsettling, but a thorough reading will help adoptive parents make sense of the miracle that ocurred when they traveled to China for a first look at a small person they would love for the rest of their lives.</span>

                    <span>The review written by "Disappointed" on Feb. 23, 2004 really embarrasses me on behalf of Chinese adoptive families everywhere. We Americans (or Westerners in general) are NOT the only hope for the abandoned girls of China. <P>Why does Disappointed appear to be so angry with adoptive parents in China, or with Kay Ann Johnson for talking about in-country adoption? I don't think the book is trying to promote domestic adoption as if it doesn't already exist, and as a replacement for international adoption. Johnson shows that it's been happening for quite a while, and that these families suffer all sorts of discrimination and obstacles because they adopted foundlings outside the social welfare system. <P>I think Johnson is just saying that there are hundreds of thousands of adoptive families in China, far far more than the rest of us who have adopted, and that these families and their adopted daughters deserve better than they are now getting from their government. Johnson isn't facilitating these adoptions, but Disappointed seems to blame her, and would question the love a Chinese woman can have for the baby she finds on her doorstep.<P>What's embarrassing is the entitlement and me-centeredness in Disappointment's note. Does she really believe that she is superior to a Chinese adoptive parent? Encouraging full citizenship for Chinese girls adopted domestically and encouraging a change in the law so that more Chinese parents can adopt legally does not make Johnson the enemy of international adoption; she is an adoptive parent herself.<P>I'm always appalled by people like Disappointed who say it's not about "the material and educational advantages that many of our daughters enjoy" when that's EXACTLY what they think it's about. Yes, we all deeply and sincerely want our children, and we can give them much besides family and love, but we can't give them a life within their birth culture, free from the complications of being an Asian Adoptee in a White World. <P>So Disappointed had to deal with endless bureaucracy and travel half way around the world to have a daughter. Was that really so hard? Should that really be a deciding factor in who might want these girls more? Does it compare to what her counterparts in China have to put up with, when they decide to adopt and raise a foundling? Her tone seems to declare "I'm better than that woman in China, because all she did was open her door, while I had to do paperwork!"<P>Johnson has tremendous empathy and compassion for adoptive families in China, who by and large have a much harder road than we do. Disappointed would do well to cultivate some of that empathy and compassion herself. Every minute of every day I am thankful for my daughters, but I just can't let myself think, the way Disappointed does, that I am somehow more entitled than anyone else or able to want them more than anyone else, least of all the adoptive families in China who endure far more than we do in order to have their daughters.</span>

                    <span>Reviewed by the author of "At Home in This World, a China Adoption Story" (EMK Press, 2003):<P>"Wanting A Daughter, Needing A Son" is a snapshot in time of the socio-political circumstances leading to the abandonment and international adoption of thousands of China's daughters. The facts and statistics that Dr. Johnson cites as part of her research, reflect a complex Catch-22 of a patrilineal society moving from desperate economic survival towards prosperity, and of population laws and policies that are unevenly policed and out of sync with the current emotional lives of Chinese parents.<P>"Wanting A Daughter, Needing A Son" is not a band-aid; it's truth won't banish our children's feelings of loss, or give adoptive parents the kind of explanations that would allow us to put a loving or heroic spin on the sad act of abandonment. But Dr Johnson's important work broadens the China adoption picture, gives it depth, and hands us the knowledge our children will eventually need in order to comprehend the complicated facets of their own Chinese/American/adoptee identity. Kay Ann Johnson's research uncovers the surprising fact that many thousands of abandoned Chinese babies actually do find happy homes (legally and illegally) within their own communities, despite our previous understanding of the one-child policy and domestic Chinese adoption. In an added twist, our children may someday realize that they have "adoptee peers" in China, who grew up in loving families with Chinese adoptive parents, and without the associated alienation of cross-cultural, trans-racial adoption that our China girls and boys must learn to live with here in the USA.<P>Dr. Johnson's interviews and statistics also tell us that the majority of our children most likely have a sibling or two living in China with our child's family of origin- bittersweet data that may someday provide a genetic connection for adult adoptees seeking birth information. I am appreciative of Dr. Johnson's illuminating research on a subject so close to my heart, and grateful to have her book to share with my daughters in the future. "Wanting A Daughter, Needing A Son" will be a solid resource for them in teen- and adulthood, and will help them to intellectually understand the time and place, cultural mentality, and forces of power that spun their young lives halfway around the world.</span>

                    <span>I just finished my "first read" of "Wanting a Daughter, Needing a<BR>Son" and am utterly impressed. I say "first<BR>read" because I find it to be an excellent reference book that is just so full of incredible information that it would be difficult to comprehend/process it all in one reading. Of all the<BR>articles and books that I have read to attempt to have a great,<BR>accurate knowledge base of information for the day when my daughter who was adopted in China asks<BR>BIG QUESTIONS about her past, THIS is THE book. I am TOTALLY in awe,<BR>and MORE THAN GRATEFUL to the "academics" among adoptive parents<BR>whose diligent and dedicated work will benefit ALL of our adopted<BR>children from China. You MUST get a copy of this book to have on hand, even if the statistical info isn't currently the kind of literature that holds your attention.</span>

                    <span>As an adoptive parent of two daughters, both adopted from China, I bought this book and eagerly awaited its arrival. Kay Ann Johnson does supply many interesting insights into the circumstances into which our children were born (most of our daughters have one or more birth siblings, probably sisters, living in China today). Many of them are also heartbreakingly sad (the infant mortality rate for foundlings in China exceeds 50% in many provinces). But her repeated puzzlement that China doesn't pursue domestic adoption more vigorously left me agape. Why would a country that heavily fines women for bearing second or third children, even forcibly sterilizing them, want to keep "over-quota" children in their own country when the explicit population policies run directly counter to that end? And why is Johnson so convinced that domestic adoption is preferable to international adoption? (She's certainly not alone in this belief. But Johnson's only stated reason is that domestic adoption is the clear preference of the Hague Convention; and all we have to do is look to the horrendous consequences of China's population initiatives to know that no policy is right just because it's a policy.) I'm sure it's true that many Chinese people love their adopted children as much as their biological ones (but many of her examples showed the opposite, too). But what is the terrible downside to international adoption? I don't think that international adoption is a wonderful solution because of the material and educational advantages that many of our daughters enjoy, but because these children are so deeply and sincerely wanted by their families. Being raised by the woman on whose doorstep you were abandoned can't really be a happier fate than being raised by parents who wanted a child so badly that they endured endless bureaucracy and travelled half way around the world to have a daughter, can it?<P>The book is also highly repetitive, separate articles that cover the same terrain, often in the exact same words as previous chapters. And the academic-speak is tiresome and relentless.<P>Anyone interested in the topic should try "The Lost Daughters of China" instead.</span>
