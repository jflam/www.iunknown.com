                <span id="Label1">RFK focuses on the final five years of Robert F. Kennedy's life beginning with President John F. Kennedy's untimely death in 1963 to his own tragic death in 1968.  From the transformation of the younger Kennedy as he moved out of the shadows of JFK to establish and define his own political persona.   Golden Globe nominee Linus Roache (The Gathering Storm, Wings of the Dove, Hart's War) is riveting in his portrayal of the young Kennedy. Also starring James Cromwell (L.A. Confidential, The Green Mile) as Lyndon Johnson, David Paymer (State and Main), Martin Donovan (Insomnia), Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction, Mission Impossible).   Written by Hank Steinberg (*61, Without A Trace) and Directed by Robert Dornhelm (Sins of the Father, Anne Frank).</span>

                    <span>In this screenplay, we see a man so haunted by the (presumably preventable) spectere of his older brother's death that he litterally becomes a whole new person in the aftermath. 
<br />
<br />The young communist inquisitor who once was friends with Wisconsin Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy (as was JFK)consequently became the devout champion of the underclass. Whether it was minorities, the poor, students or some other group, the 'new' Bobby was sincerely committed to ensuring everybody could (and did) participate in the American dream. 
<br />
<br />What makes this transformation all the more magical is that a campaign consultant did not make the suggestion (and given how little some of these groups could financially contribute while their association simmutaeneously could have caused big political stigmatization, perhaps attempted to talk him out of these very same actions). It is to RFK's credit that he ultimately stood his own ground and took the road much less traveled in American politics. 
<br />
<br />Because I came of age in the post-watergate generation, I am accustomed to candidates (regardless of political ideology and/or party) appearing replete with slick demeanor's. The rattling of RFK's psyche following Dallas 1963 ultimately produced a folksy demeanor that even Jimmy Carter ultimately had failed to replicate during his presidential candidate and presidency. 
<br />
<br />If his own fate were different, Kennedy easily would have become the 20th century's second most influential president---immediately after fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt.   </span>

                    <span>RFK is a good movie.
<br />the music is good, the story line, and the actors are all awsome.
<br />Mr. Roache played a very good and very convincing Bobby Kennedy who is at a crossroads with the death of his brother, Jack Kennedy.
<br />
<br />the movie shows just how distrought Bobby really was and still how much the death of his brother bothered him. The film implies to a good extent that Bobby did in fact feel responsible for his brother's death, and the spirit of JFK tells Bobby that.
<br />
<br />I like the views from the spirit of JFK, who only Bobby can see, because it makes Bobby that much more human.  He wanted to do good things, he really did. He sought another view, possibly putting an end to the war in Vietnam, he sought to help out poor people, minorities, and fought for values more than for votes.
<br />
<br />Bobby really turned over a leaf from attack dog as Attorney General to a really good man who wanted to do good things, but a bullet ended that dream.  The ending speech and the train ride footage ends the movie perfectly cause it feels like a metaphor for the life of Bobby Kennedy.  He touched and moved so many people in his short 42 years of life, and still today inspires a whole new generation.
<br />
<br />great movie on Bobby Kennedy, i only wish there was special features like commentary and stuff like that.

                    <span>I was hoping for much better from this production.  But based on the fact that nobody else in the world has seen it, I should have known better.  I thought the movie was so bad, I could not finish.<p>The writers have chosen to rewrite history in many ways.  First, RFK apparently had schizophrenia because his reality was very distorted.  JFK kept appearing to RFK throughout the movie.  The most interesting thing is that RFK only speaks in a Massachusetts accent to his brother (or brother's illusion). As if distorting reality is not enough of a crime, the movie accuses Lyndon Johnson and the CIA of killing John Kennedy.    <p>Read a book on this fallen Catholic leader.  Do not rely on this travesty as a source.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I first caught this movie on FX when it premiered, and I hoped that more people will see it now that it's on DVD. The movie is concerned with Bobby Kennedy's evolution after his brother's death in 1963, and Linus Roache does a convincing job of playing the late man (He and the actor who played RFK in Thirteen Days are the two best I've seen at this difficult acting job). Being something of a RFK buff, I found this film moving and worth watching. In this time of politicians who cater to the lowest common denominator (on both sides of the aisle), we need to look back on men like Bobby Kennedy, who genuinely cared about the underdogs of American society and was killed in the midst of his greatest act of compassion. One of these days, people will recognize RFK as the best man who was never elected President. This movie is a good start for anyone wondering "what all the fuss was about". I recommend it</span>
