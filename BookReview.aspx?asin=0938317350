                <span id="Label1">Four pages into this rollicking good story, the central figure, Lee Chagra, comes alive: "[Lee] washed his morning cocaine down with strong coffee and remembered the time he had met Sinatra, how genuine he appeared." Everything you'll need to know and remember about Chagra--the son of Syrian immigrants to Mexico and an attorney who spun the world of dope-running, border-crossing, high-living outlaws along the El Paso-Juarez border around his finger like the gaudy rings he favored--can be neatly summarized in that one sentence. Forget the byzantine complications of the plot to follow: Lee Chagra dies two pages later, yet he haunts the rest of this cautionary tale like a high-rolling specter.<p>  Cartwright tells the story of the Chagra brothers, Lee and Joe, as they get mixed up with the drug-running community along the border and in short order find themselves hopelessly entangled in a net cast by the DEA. Even readers unfamiliar with the well-publicized events of the book or of the dark, lawless aspect that often rules El Paso will find themselves pulled along by the plot: brigands and intrigue leap from almost every page, and the story just gets wilder the further into it you venture.<p>  Cartwright's undisguised distaste for certain law officials and agencies is sure to irk some readers; however, his ultimate ability to tell a good story should make <I>Dirty Dealing</I> palatable to even the most stalwart law-and-order types. <I>--Tjames Madison</I></span>

                    <span>Cartwright's friendship with Joe and Patty Chagra is quite evident throughout the contents of this book. As a historical and informative book, I enjoyed it very much. However, Cartwright's constant attempt to portray the Chagras as victims of an over-zealous federal investigation or as some type of folk heros is absurd. Lee, Jimmy, and Joe were the typical, bottom-of-the-barrel scum who hurt many true victims in our society. And I am referring to not just the assassination of Judge Wood, but all the crime that is associated with any narcotics dealer. The U.S. government did an excellent job to remove Jimmy, Joe, and the other worthless members of their group from society. Joe had no business attempting to get his law license back after his time in jail. The government never promised to help him get it back, as Cartwright insinuates in his book. The government doesn't make promises like that. The only people that may have seen the Chagras as "heros" were fellow criminals. And even then, the Chagras weren't the brightest individuals as they were always flaunting their wealth, doing cocaine, and drawing attention to themselves. It's the smart criminals that don't get caught.</span>

                    <span>The murder of Judge "Maximum" John Wood is a fascinating case, and I'm bewildered as to why it is the subject of apparently just this book. It is my understanding that the FBI spent more time investigating the assassination (which had Woody Harrelson's father as the triggerman!) than in any other case besides the Kennedy murder.<P>Yet I regret to say that this book is essentially a "hit job" of its own against Judge Wood. The author seems to rely on a lot of statements from defense attorneys (not the type of people to love a judge who hands out stiff punishments). He also "weeps" copious tears over the lot of one Joe Chagra, the brother of Jamiel Chagra, the man who actually ordered the hit. If memory serves, the author gives the impression that he thought it was a shame that Joe Chagra, who admitted to playing a role in the killing, was not allowed to practice law after being released from prison (he subsequently died in a traffic accident).<P>I am prepared to accept that Judge Wood was not a fair judge. I am also prepared to accept that Joe Chagra may not have been the prince of darkness. However, I will never accept the argument that Chagra, a lawyer and officer of the court, should have been allowed to resume being a lawyer after playing a role, however tangential, in what amounts to a direct assault on the judicial system itself.<P>I will also never accept the subtext of the book that if Wood had been fairer, he wouldn't have been killed. As if the fact that a judge is unfair gives a criminal (a VERY powerful drug dealer) to kill him. Give me a break.</span>

                    <span>I'm surprised to see such little attention given to this book. Anyway, extremely well written, fascinating story line, colorful characters.<P>There's lots of details here (almost too many) and probably requires a second reading to understand the full impact and all the connections. But it's a great story that has many twists and turns.<P>My only criticism is with the organization of the book. Much of the first third focuses on a character (spoiler) who ends up dying. At that point the story changes focus on two other characters, so all the story arcs have to start all over again. There's tons of details, so I imagine the nightmare in trying to organize all the overlapping details.<P>That said, it's not a big deal, and probably more of a personal preference.<P>Read this book. It really is exceptional.</span>

                    <span>Gary Cartwright is a National Treasure. His portrayal of the Federal System is right on the target. Several years ago I was selected to sit on a Federal Grand Jury and came away from that experience with a profound distrust of the feds. Over and over again, in that jury room, we were subjected to lies, misrepresentations (one DEA agent even came in the room, gave evidence, and only upon questioning from those in the room did it come out that he was no where near the incident he just described in such vivid detail. The statute of limitations was about to run out and he was told to read the file and act like he was the arresting officer)and deception. We had a diet of this for 18 months and all of us agreed that these guys can't be trusted. This book bears that out and brought back a ton of memories. If you get in trouble, never trust what they tell you they're going to do if you cooperate, and always get your deal in writing before you talk.</span>

                    <span>For those who think that the law doesn't make mistakes. For those who want to know how the underworld works, this is the book for you. Cartwright keeps the book going and pulls no punches when it comes to revealing how the government can simply stack the charges on anyone they choose. This book tells of drugs, money laundering, murder, gambling, poor law enforcement performance, and how power corrupts. The author deals in facts, so you can come to your own conclusions about Dirty Dealing. <P>I liked it so much that I bought the hard copy at a book show and had Cartwright sign it.</span>
