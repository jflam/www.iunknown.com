                    <span>THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ. I READ A LEAST 4 BOOKS A WEEK AND I AM SURPISE BY SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS. I AGREE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF TYPOS AND GRAMMAR ERRORS; BUT PASS THAT "A PROJECT CHICK" HAS NICE STORY LINE. I HAVE GAVE MY COPY TO OVER TEN PEOPLE, AND ONLY RECIEVED ONE BAD COMMENT. SHE COULD NOT RELATE TO THE BOOK BECAUSE SHE WAS OLDER AND DID UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLES OF A PSYCO BOYFRIEND.</span>

                    <span>This Author shows no growth between her previous book and this one, in fact, she declines.  I gave the last one two stars for entertainment value, but this one was straight up stupid.  There was nothing real about it except for the fact that the main character is triffling (Although the author does not seem to think so).  Nikki Turner seems to think that women who mess with hustlers and hustle themselves in any kind of way, including prostituion, deserve to be on some kind of pedestal.  The publisher also has not shown any kind of growth, or hired a decent proof reader to catch the horrible spelling and editing mistakes.  These books must be typed on the typewriter, what other excuse is there for not using SPELLCHECK?  The story line is all over the place, there is just nothing real about it.  Keep trying Nikki.  I don't recommend buying this book.  You can have my copy for free.</span>

                    <span>This book was very good from the very start. It wasnt that unrealistic. I thought it was very suspenseful. When I picked this book up I didnt think it would come close to A Hustlers Wife but I was wrong. I cant wait to read the next one.</span>

                    <span>THIS BOOK HAD TO BE THE FAKEST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. I WAS NOT FEELING TRESSA AT ALL. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS APBOLUTELY A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I EXPECTED IT TO BE GOOD BUT IT REALLY DON'T DESERVE THE TWO STARS I GAVE IT. ALL THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED IN THIS BOOK WAS STRAIGHT UP UNREAL. WHAT KIND OF GHETTO WAS SHE TRYING TO IMATATE IT SHOULD AIN'T THE HOOD I WAS RAISED IN. IT JUST WASN'T REALISTIC THESE BOOKS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BASED OF OF REAL LIFE NOT A DISNEY FAIRY TALE. TRUST ME DON'T WASTE YO TIME IT AINT WORTH IT. </span>

                    <span>so what this book is not perfect, it's still good. tripple crown keeps it real for the streets. thats what they are about. their books are not watered down and perfect like everybody want it to be. tressa was raw for setting her boyfriends place on fire when she found out her friend was inside with him. people don't understand what this book represents. if people don't have nothing nive to say about this book they shouldn;t say nothing. the person that wrote this book tried her best to give people a good entertainer story and that is what she did, and she got my props.</span>
