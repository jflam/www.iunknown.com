                <span id="Label1">The Apache Web server is one of the most fascinating success stories in the Internet software business. This open-source product has arguably become the most used Web server on the Net. <I>Apache Server Unleashed</I> offers traditional documentation of this unconventional product.<p> A key aspect of Apache is its modularity. Webmasters are free to custom-build Apache installations that precisely fit their needs by compiling only the software modules they want. The authors do a good job of exploring these possibilities but still manage to present the material in an organized, topical manner. They take a little time along the way to delve into some key related technologies such as Common Gateway Interface (CGI), cookies, Perl, and Personal Home Page (PHP)--a very popular server-side scripting language frequently used to add the smarts to Apache applications.<p> The chapters are all rather bite-size, making this book easy to digest for those with scattered chunks of reading time. To get the most from Apache, a solid understanding of C programming is a must. Even so, this book offers much for the nonprogrammer interested in learning about Apache. Included is a CD-ROM containing the source code for the Apache 1.3.9 release, as well as several third-party utilities like Comanche--a key administration tool. If you have experience with commercial Web servers and are curious what all the fuss is about with Apache, this title offers a well-rounded look at the hottest Web server around. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Installation, server configuration files, configuration with Comanche, MIME types, proxy and cache server use, CGI programming, server-side includes, cookie implementation, security and auditing, authentication, logging, Apache modules, Perl module, PHP module, and Apache API.</span>

It does not have the level of detail that, say, a good O'Reilly book has, but I believe it happens to be as good as (or maybe a touch better than) the O'Reilly book on this subject.</span>

                    <span>Apache Web Server is the most widely-used Web Server on the net, and for good reason! This book shows you how to harness the incredible power of the Apache Server. It explains everything, from the different request code-values and what they mean, to every line of the httpd.conf configuration file. Also, this book is nearly platform independent! Use it on Windows or Linux (Unix) it doesn't really matter! Of course it favors the Unix platform a little more because that is its native platform. If you are trying to run Apache Server, get this book! It also serves as an INCREDIBLE reference text.</span>

                    <span>The top choice for understanding Apache concepts and for installing the webserver for several reasons. First, compare it to the competition. The text is easier to understand and a faster read than Wrox's "Professional Apache" (sometimes Wrox books meander to fill space), and the "Apache Bible", is not even in the same league because of problems with organization and presentation.<P>The best way to sum it up: The Authors of "Apache Unleashed" are not afraid of the product so after reading the text you understand what the Apache trend is really about - A very simple yet powerful product -. I guess this is why 60% of Internet servers are Apache based. Intentionally, the book "Apache Unleashed" remains true to this concept. <P>Of special note - This book also addresses Windows users who want to run Apache (I believe this is a growing market.)<P>Starting from scratch, I was able to install Apache and point 150 domains to my in-house web server during one weekend. (You also need O'Reilly's DNS Bind to do this.)<P>Good Luck!</span>

                    <span>Just a note of clarification: I suspect that that K. Limberg was thinking of a different book when writing the last review. There are at least two books that might have prompted it: one is essentially a copy of the source code ('Apache Server Commentary'), and the other is a copy of the documentation on the Web site (I have a copy, but can't remember the title). I can assure you that 'Apache Server Unleashed' is neither of these; it contains hundreds of pages of technical custom-written text that appear nowhere else. I know, because I wrote a bunch of it. :-)<P>BTW, the 5-star rating I've given is because I have to give *some* rating, and to offset the single star from what I sincerely believe is a mistaken review.</span>
