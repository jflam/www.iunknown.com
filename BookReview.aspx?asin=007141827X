                    <span>I am so pleased I purchased this book and I definitely recommend it.  I consider this book to be a must-have for anyone serious about preparing for rigorous interviews.  It addressed all of the key things I had big questions about-from how to dress in an interview to how to follow up after an interview.  The section about informational interviewing was especially good at providing perspectives that I had never considered, and I feel that How to Interview Like a Top MBA has made me much more prepared for going into job interviews-both formal and informational-and doing excellently.  </span>

                    <span>How To Interview Like a Top MBA, by Shel Leanne, is extremely well written and provides great insight into how to interview excellently for a job.  The topics covered in the main text are very timely, with chapters about situations in which you may be trying to get a more advanced position, as well as ways to approach a job interview if you have been out of work for a while or if you are transitioning to a new field. The book also has a very valuable sample 100 Questions and Answers section.  This book was thoughtful and insightful, and the advice from headhunters and recruiters add great dimensions.</span>

                    <span>Shelly Leanne does an excellent job in providing important insights in How To Interview Like a Top MBA. The book will be useful for those in business as well as other fields. It seems as if it would have been hard in the market of interview preparation books to write something novel, but this book accomplishes that wonderfully.  I greatly enjoyed the range of topics covered - from how to do research about a job and industry before you try to interview for a job, to how to deal with tough questions.  The sample Q&A section is very useful. I highly recommend this book.</span>
