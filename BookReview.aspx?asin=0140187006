                    <span>As a fan of Narayan's work, I was fascinated to see how he would tackle the grand subject of the Ramayana, a work that runs through and certainly influences all of Narayan's stories.  The result is one of his most delightful and beautifully written novels. I think it is important to approach this book not as "THE" Ramayana, but one storyteller's unique vision of the timeless epic--even as a variation on one of his Malgudi novels (the characters certainly bare a distinct resemblance).  Narayan's writing is extremely sensitive, refined, yet full of humor and charm.  Throughout he adopts the tone of a storyteller, openly acknowledging that he is only "retelling" a story by a much greater storyteller, and leaving out the juciest parts at that.  His little asides where he explains, "And here the poet described the scene so touchingly..." are at once reverent and amusing, as Narayan wisely omits anything too excessive or poetic that might derail his narrative. But the story itself is wonderful, a colorful, full-blooded telling of the Ramayana, sparse, fast-moving, but with all the hallmarks of Narayan's style.  This book is a must for any fan of Narayan's fiction, Indian writing, or mythology.  Narayan effectively conveys the epic's timelessness, with characters and situations that echo throughout literature and film, full of profound human emotions.  And this is always one of Narayan's chief strengths, to create believable, complex human characters.  In his treatment, even Rama and Sita emerge as sympathetic individuals, not the cardboard cut-outs all too common given their extraordinary powers.  In short, this is a magical and engaging work that I know I will read again and again in the years to come.  I invite you to do the same!</span>

                    <span>The story of Ramayana is in the blood stream of everyone from India. The original epic was written in the 4th century BC in Sanskrit, by Valmiki. Poets in every Indian language have retold this story. This present book relying on the Tamil Kamban version, presents before the reader the essential story of Ramayana. R.K Narayan, with the command of the English language and love for fast story movement, narrates the kernel of the epic poem in an engaging manner, for the sake of the English reader not familiar with the original version. Naturally, some of the elaborate details had to be left out and some narratives had to be condensed. This made the enormous epic into an enjoyably gripping story, in less than 200 pages.</span>

                    <span>Given the extensive length and painstaking detail of the original  Ramayana, I welcomed the idea of a shortened prose version.  Unfortunately,  Narayan's version is poorly executed.  First, he never quite manages to  settle into a specific way of telling the story.  Sometimes he writes as  though he intended this to be a text book relating the events and  variations of the original story.  At other times, he writes as though he  is a story teller himself.  This uncomfortable juxtaposition detracts from  the flow of the book.  Also, while I realize that this is intended as a  shortened version, I think Narayan goes too far.  171 pages is not nearly  sufficient to adequately convey the stories and their intricacies.  Narayan  skips between detailed passages and quick, choppy narratives which ends up  being distracting and interupts the book's continuity.  Finally, I was  appalled by the frequent gramatic errors in the book.  Most noticeable were  the dangling prepositions scattered throughout the text, which prove very  distracting.  All of these problems combine to make this book an  unrewarding read as well as a shoddy version of a wonderful epic.</span>

                    <span>This is a condensed version of not the original Ramayana as handed down to us in Sanskrit, but of the Tamil version of the story that Sri Narayanji grew up with. There are versions of the Ramayana in nearly all Indian  dialects and languages, and as Tamil is one of the oldest, it is also quite  interesting to see a translation from that language. The tale is told  fairly faithfully, although much is left out (this is necessary to avoid  having to sell several volumes to tell the whole tale, as the original tale  is HUGE). I thought that it may have been a rather boring story, especially  to a modern reader, but boy, was I ever wrong! This was one of the most  entertaining and gripping books that I have ever read. It tells the story  of Ramachandra's youth to his betrayal by his stepmother, his journey in  the desert, and how he defeated Ravana, who had kidanapped Sita and brought  her to Sri Lanka, as well as Hanuman's revelries. Rama is still an  excellent example of Hindoo ideals, but the primary value of the story for  me was not so much religious or ethical as much as it was simply a  fascinating journey into the vast world of Indian literature. A wonderful  read; I would recommend it to anyone.</span>

                    <span>I found the tale of Rama was a great tale but the way in which it was summarized was poor.  The author left out important details and added not so important facts.</span>
