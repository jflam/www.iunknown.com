                    <span>Fortune 500 HR executives do in fact give tips for resumes and cover letters in this book. But if they possess the magic key to getting an interview, they don't share it. Readers won't get the interview everytime because the advice is tired and common: list your experiences and education on your resume; attach a cover letter. Basic online job hunting tips have been layered on top to make the advice seem fresh. It's not. And if it worked, there wouldn't be any need for newer strategies such as the "accomplishment" strategy (at least you prove that you were useful to a business) and the "self-marketing" strategy (much more aligned with a business's needs). As an employer, I want to know what a candidate will do to bring profit to my business and peace of mind to me. It's that simple. I don't want to infer or guess.  And, contrary to what this book implies, I am more receptive to candidates who show initiative and creativity.</span>

                    <span>I am looking for a job for the first time in 30 years.I had no idea as to how to start the process, so I borrowed this book from a friend. It gave me a really good place to start, and made it easy. If you don't have a direction, this book will give you a hand. I love this book!!!

                    <span>The books listed some common information you could get on some websites. This book is too general, it has to be more detailed. For example, in the chapter of interview, it told you you have to prepare for questions recuritors will ask and listed around 20 sample questions there. However, it didn't give you any sample answer even a guideline to answer these questions.
<br />
<br />This book started with a real great idea but ended in a poor execution. The author did a survey to furtune top 500 companies.  However, she didn't present those data she collected well.
<br />
<br />My suggestion is if you never know how to find a job and you don't like to do research on google, this could be your first guidebook.</span>

                    <span>I'm not applying to a Fortune 500 Company, but this book is still a big help.  It not only talks about resume guidelines but also cover letters, interviews, networking, and internet tips.  The information is up to date and to the point.  A thing I like about this book is that it is shorter than many other resume books.  Which is good because it can be discouraging trying to do all the exercises the big resume books tell you to go through.  This book helps you get a fanatastic resume tailored to the specific job you are applying to in a minimal amount of time.</span>

                    <span>Looking for a job is a lot easier with this book for<br>many reasons. First, the author surveyed Fortune 500<br>Human Resources executives, asking what they look for<br>in a résumé. Who better to poll than the people who<br>make decisions about résumés every day? This type of<br>first-hand information alone makes the book an<br>invaluable resource, and the rest of it gets down to<br>the nuts and bolts. Based on the Fortune 500 feedback,<br>the author provides a wealth of specifics on the<br>difficult process of writing résumés and cover letters<br>that resonate with the people on the receiving end. Of<br>great practical value are the examples of<br>before-and-after résumés. This approach illustrates<br>how to position your work history and personal<br>attributes to maximum advantage. And the<br>recommendations on use of language and formatting help<br>in creating professional, well-written documents. The<br>chapter on how to submit résumés by e-mail demystifies<br>this process. And an added bonus is the critique of<p>one résumé by several of the Human Resources people<br>interviewed for the book. Finally, the 68 pages of<br>résumés at the end of the book make it easy for anyone<br>to find approaches and language suited to their needs.<br>This book can help anyone to focus and fine-tune the<br>job-search process?not to mention gain confidence.</span>
