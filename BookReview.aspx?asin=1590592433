                <span id="Label1"><p>Thomas Kyte has a simple philosophy: You can treat Oracle as a black box and shove data inside of it, or you can learn how Oracle works and exploit it as a powerful computing environment. If you choose the latter, you will see there are few information management problems you cannot solve quickly and elegantly. <p>  Kyte has selected the most important features and techniques to discuss in <i> Expert One-on-One Oracle, </i> which he teaches in a proof-by-example manner. He discusses available features, implementing software using these features, and avoiding potential pitfalls.</span>

                    <span>A must read book for DBA's and developers... Usually books on Oralce are either written from development prospective or administration... But this book clearly indiciates relationship between Administration and development.. Best part of this books is it gives you proof of every claim present in book.. He has also discussed all the common and un-common errors people make in developing applications. User level defined for this book is Intermediate-Advance... But that way he has defined Oracle architecture in chapter 2, this can be a very good book for bigeners. Only book apart from this book which can give u a better picture of Oracle architecture is Oracle concept guide. But still way of presenting architecture in this book is much much better.. Last but not least this book tells what you should do and what you should not do, in order to design better application and manage Oracle server for applications to perform well...</span>

                    <span>I have the previously published one, but I believe the book is substantially unchanged between publications.  I just counted, I have 14 Oracle books that I have purchased, plus a whole bookshelf of 3-ring notebooks full of printed Oracle Documentation.  Expert One-on-One is the first book I reach for no matter what the subject.  It's full of detailed explanations and examples.  The best thing about Tom Kyte's writing is that his examples work!
<br />
<br />Plus he tells it like it is.  If you didn't know anything about technology and wanted to manage a software development project, you could rip out the first 3 pages of this book, throw the rest of it away and you'd be better off than 95% of the managers out there.  
<br />
<br />The rest of the book is for us hands-on folks....

                    <span>One can not imagine how it would have been working with Oracle RDBMS without a person called Tom Kyte! He has changed the way professionals worked with Oracle through his ideas, approach and experience. He simply put, gives a solid foundation to anyone who wants to venture out in Oracle world or in general IT world. His approach is plain and simple, make a test case, prove it and use it in your applications, then benchmark and repeat the same steps again and again. That is what he has demonstrated in this book and his famous forum asktom.oracle.com. If one has read this book and participates into the forum, the explanations made or approach taken by Tom in the above forum will be even more clearer. I have read this book end to end two times so far and intend to read many more times. In fact I have two copies of it one in my office and another at my home! When I read first time I felt I was lucky that I had got the job before, for I did not know so much..and when I read second time I had almost similar feelings...if you do not believe me come and try reading the book and see whether you also have similar feeling or not! A must for any person who has interest in Oracle RDBMS. </span>

                    <span>Database Design is one of the most critical issues in application development. Tom's book is the road to success if you develop applications using the Oracle database server. Have you ever seen a book like this for an other DBMS product? Please let me know!</span>
