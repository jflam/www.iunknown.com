                    <span>I bought the "Power of Now" a few months ago and, of course, Amazon[.com] made note of it in their database. But that's a GOOD thing because they recently notified me about Eckhart Tolle's new offerings: "The Realization of Being" - and - "Even the Sun Will Die"
<br />
<br />I loved "The Power of Now" - a book, I feel, EVERYone would benefit from owning and reading time and time again. (A helpful practice until you 'get it' and can apply the concepts, his teachings to your daily life)
<br />
<br />And because I enjoyed this book so much, I went ahead and ordered both of the reccomended tapes (actually, CDs).
<br />
<br />"Even the Sun Will Die" is a beautiful work of art - and, like "The Power of Now" - is something you can (and WILL) listen to over and over and over again. DEFINITELY worth owning!
<br />
<br />But "The Realization of Being" was a BIG disappointment. No, wait - A HUGE disappointment! ! !
<br />
<br />It's obvious this particular CD is a recording of a workshop he gave somewhere, at some time - and that's all fine and good EXCEPT - it's like the workshop was a 4 hour event - and this tape only gives you hours # 2 and 3. So, you 'come in late' (and have to play catch-up) - and then the second CD bails out without a proper closing. Heck, you even hear Eckhart say on the tape: "We're going to take a lunch break now." - and then, that's it!
<br />
<br />So, after thoroughly enjoying "The Power of Now" and "Even the Sun Will Die" - you can imagine how let-down I felt after hearing this "haphazardly thrown together piece of mish-mosh".
<br /> 
<br />Eckhart's a fine man - one of the folks who'll definitely lead us into the new era of unconditional love and peace - but this particular tape (as far as I'm concerned) is an embarrasment - and truly NOT the way to present the views and guidance of such a talented soul.</span>

                    <span>This CD set deserves 10 stars. I play it again again and always hear something new. It's an essential companion to The Power of Now tapes (which I transferred to CD). <p>The meaning of life, the secret of happiness and lasting inner peace are all here for the taking. If only my ego would let me take it all in. In the meantime, I'll keep listening. <p>Thank you, Eckhart!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this cd. This is really enjoyable and interesting. I liked the simplicity of the message to live in the now through silence and awareness of your own being. There is so much value in this cd.</span>

                    <span>Eckhardt Tolle's "THE REALIZATION OF BEING" provides the listener with a genuine opportunity to experience the subject of this recorded seminar:  being, and all the aliveness that goes with it.  In the first CD, Tolle discusses what it's like to live in the moment and what drives us out of the moment.  By the second CD, Tolle's speaking pace drops significantly, so that listeners can experience the energy of their being during silence.  The tone of this audio CD is calm and meditative.  In fact, a disclaimer on the back cover cautions not to listen to the program while driving or operating heavy machinery due to the meditative nature of the recording.  In his generally quiet way, (with occasional bursts of faster and more energetic speaking) Tolle guides listeners to the richness of living from the state of being, not from thinking.  We're all very good at thinking, he says, but being requires practice.  Another great way to practice living in the moment is through the work of authors Ariel and Shya Kane - read their book "WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK" or listen to one of their audiotapes, such as "THE PRINCIPLES OF TRANSFORMATION."  On the subject of living life as magically as it is intended to be, Tolle and the Kanes represent a rare and great guiding force.</span>
