                    <span>When you get involved in studying political events and movements, ultimately there is going to be some disagreement on interpretations.  While the Civil Righs Movement has suffered less revisionist history than many events of the last century, it is still valuable to go to the source documents and read about events in the words of those who participated in history or who made history. I agree that this book works well in tandem with another more narrative history, such as Eyes on the Prize, or Partin the Waters.  But the compilers have done an excellent job of grouping by topics, with clear introductions putting the pieces that follow into proper place.  I was surprised - I feared that this would be more dry of a read than it was. Instead I found myself pulled along, especially by some riveting first hand accounts of events such as the Attica riots. Another big plus for the book is that it brings the documents and the struggles into the 1980's, when first published.  Many books ont he Civil Rights Movement cover until 1965, or 1968, this one keeps events in the 1970's and 80's relevant to what came before. I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking to feel as if they were there for these struggles, and understand our history.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book to get get a background on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950's and 60's.  I read it when I began trying to learn about the CRM and some of the key players.</span>

                    <span>I think that this book is a valued companion to Taylor Branch's epic work  "Parting the Waters". Together, they make an unbeatable pair of study aids for one of America's most turbulent periods.<p>While P.T.W. is a  more dispassionate third person chronicle, E.O.T.P. is more personally  driven.  It brings to life individuals like Bayard Rustin, Stokley  Carmichael, John Lewis and other giants (known and obscure) of the  movement.  Events from the Till lynching to the Attica riots as seen  through the eyes of those on the scene (sometimes, those making the  scene).<p>Fascinating reading.</span>
