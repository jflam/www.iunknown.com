                <span id="Label1">Written by the developers of Visual Basic, <I>Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Programmer's Guide</I> gives you a solid overall grounding in the language and the major tasks you will undertake in the development environment.<p> The book is divided into two parts and a series of appendices. The first part introduces the basic concepts of the Visual Basic environment and explains the form- and event-driven paradigm. Five chapters later, the authors explain forms, controls, and projects and give a quick primer on the unique structure of the Visual Basic language, its data types, and its use of functions, procedures, and code modules.<p> The second part, "What You Can Do with Visual Basic," makes up the majority of the book. A chapter on user-interface creation illustrates how to create single and multiple-document interfaces and how to implement dialogs and toolbars, and presents some general user-interface tips. Following chapters cover each of the Visual Basic custom controls, present advanced project-compilation concepts, and introduce the object-oriented features of Visual Basic.<p> The guide then presents ActiveX components, event and error handling, text and graphics manipulation, performance optimization, and other crucial topics. Four appendices spell out Visual Basic's limits, coding conventions, compiler options, and how to add help to your programs. No matter what your skill level, this programmer's guide will become a frequently visited companion. <I>--Stephen Plain</I></span>

                    <span>Even though this book runs to over 900 words it contains none of the padding and waffle found in many VB6 books. Maybe this would make it tough reading for complete beginners and it might be better to read an introductory book such as Sams "Teach yourself Visual Basic 6 in 21 days" first.<P>To really get into VB6 you would also need Microsoft's "Visual Basic 6 Component Tools Guide" as component creation is really central to the VB6 programming paradigm and isn't touched in this book.<P>Even after reading and understanding this book there's still a lot of subjects that aren't really covered in any sort of depth (like ADO). This is more a consequence of the enormity of the new VB6 environment rather than any shortcoming of the book. <P>The book content is available electronically on the VB disk but I find reading from the screen very difficult and miss the contents and index.<P>If you can read and understand everything in this book you will be completely equipped to tackle any of the more advanced VB6 books.<P>Though I had a few gripes, given the task of providing a reasonably complete programmer's guide, and the constraint of cramming it all into 900 pages, Microsoft have done a good job with this book.</span>

                    <span>As a contract programmer that has used VB since 2.0, I recommend this set, along with the "Reference Library" for any serious programmer, from rookie to pro. With each VB generation, I reread the Programmer's Guide. For example, chapters 9 and 10 are a must before the reader is ready for Reference Library's "Component Tools Guide" (which teaches you how to design and build ActiveX components.<P>Caveat for the rookies: Visual Basic has become a very complex and powerful language since its first release, when it was supposed to be used for GUI prototypes. You will need to spend time and effort learning the language and the various Microsoft strategies. I recommend SAM's "Teach Yourself VBx In 21 Days" and other beginner books in addition to this one. You can do a lot useful programming without ever touching the ActiveX component development.<P>BTW, there is an index and, yes, you will be referred to the online help for details in a lot of subjects. But that will be details and broader understanding. This book is already over 900 pages. "War and Peace" we don't need.</span>

                    <span>For 90% of the VB questions that I have I can find the answer in this book. It is a great programmers reference. Of course it is just about the Visual Basic language itself and really doesn't delve to far into using VB to program databases or anything like that. Just a good solid reference to the basics of the core language itself.</span>

                    <span>This is a good step-by-step book for learning Visual Basic 6.0 Professional Edition. There are some minor mistakes in this book but overall it is a very good book. If you follow along, you should not have a lot of problems. Please note, this book is geared toward the "Professional Edition", you will need to have a strong understanding of the features of "Enterprise Edition" in order to pass the certification exams. Subjects such as the Visual Component Manager, Visual SourceSafe, MTS/COM+ are not covered or bearly covered. You will need other books in order to get a more thorough knowledge of these subjects. Visual Basic Professional Edition and/or Visual Studio Professional Edition are excellent for SOHO (Small office, home office). I have Visual Studio 6.0 Professional Edition installed on my home PC and I use this book to solve some of the issues that arrises.</span>
