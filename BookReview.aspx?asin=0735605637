                <span id="Label1"><I>Dynamic HTML in Action</I> does a great job of explaining how to use HTML and Dynamic HTML, as well as client-side scripting languages and other Web technologies (particularly as they apply to Microsoft's client-side Web software). Primarily, this book reveals a lot about the ways Web designers can make their pages' content look its best. Supplemented with information about the technologies that enable clients to make queries against databases, <I>Dynamic HTML in Action</I> will do a lot to improve the quality of the material on Web sites and intranets. <p>The early portions of this book will look familiar to anyone who's built any sort of Web page, since the authors cover traditional HTML tags first. From there, they proceed to show how to incorporate client-side scripts in HTML documents by providing a fine tutorial on event handlers, data structures, control structures, and the relevant aspects of object orientation, particularly in JavaScript. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)--still the most popular way to define complex styles--get excellent explanatory treatment. <I>Dynamic HTML in Action</I> also shows how to integrate scripting by using scripts to alter styles. Filters and transitions are well documented, along with embedded multimedia.<p> This book isn't all about appearances. There's solid coverage of Dynamic HTML's capacity to work with Data Source Objects (DSOs) and data bindings that provide efficient connections between client-side documents and back-end databases. And while the authors stop well short of fully documenting Extensible Markup Language (XML), they do provide an excellent introduction to the capabilities of this up-and-coming data-description system. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>This edition provides way better coverage of working cross-browser. It looks like the authors put a lot of thought into creating samples that worked in both browsers wherever possible, and told us why when a sample didn't. I thought that the writing was excellent and very accessible, both to novices and more advanced programmers. It includes lots of sample code (on the cd along with some tools and extensive references). This book has a lot more information than the first edition. It also includes a bunch of new IE5-specific stuff, like behaviors. All in all, a great book to learn DHTML.</span>

                    <span>True, this is not a great reference, though the CD contains great reference material and there are www links scattered liberally throughout the text. For more general DHTML references one would do better with either Goodman's "Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide" (O'Reilly & Assoc., 1998) for a cross-platform perspective or Francis et al. "IE5 DHTML Prog. Ref. 2nd Ed." (Wrox Press, 1999) for a very IE5-centric text.<P>What this book excels at is showing you how to do stuff with DHTML, combining (Java)script-ing, CSS, and touching on XML. It doesn't go deeply into any particular subject, nor does it skim too lightly, and its "portal" approach almost guarantees there are links to more information.<P>Netscape-centric developers will find this text off-putting to offensive. This book stresses - though is not exclusive to - IE4 and 5. As Microsoft and Netscape converge on the W3C DHTML specification we can hope browser-specific DHTML books will be replaced by more standardized texts.<P>I would recommend this book to anyone who is at least slightly familiar with the technologies and wants to put them together quickly to create eye-catching sites. Its Javascript tutorial is weak - if you're not already familiar with Javascript or its siblings (JScript, ECMAScript) start elsewhere then return to this book for practical uses of Javascript.</span>

                    <span>The simple fact is: Internet Explorer 4.0 and later now owns more than 80% of the browser market. Because of this, the books focus on the browser is not necessarily a bad thing. Plus, it's a Microsoft book - anyone who buys it thinking it will cater completely to Netscape Navigator is fooling themself.<P>Eitherway, this book is amazing for people wanting to begin their quest on learning DHTML. Though I have been professionally designing web pages for years, I have been forced to focus on ASP driven pages or static HTML pages. JavaScript has consistently alluded my understanding. VBScript was easy. JavaScript has never made much sense and I have lost interest in learning it, book after book.<P>However, this book teaches you unbelievably well. I was literally JOYED to see the way that this book was explaining things to me, ONE event, one action, one attribute at a time. It was so refreshing to have things slowly doled out to you rather than be tossed in over your head, gasping for air.<P>If you don't know much about JavaScript/DHTML and are interested in learning - this is your book. Pick it up immediately. Yes, it's older, but the foundation it gives you is wonderful.</span>

                    <span>I can't believe this book was ever published. The writing is vague. If the authors/editors understood their subject matter they should be able to explain it. Very disappointing. Writing too vague for a beginner; too brief for an intermediate.</span>

                    <span>The best audience for this book is probably a beginner or intermediate web developer. It does a great job of TEACHING. It isn't a reference-it's only 500 pages and a reference that just covers scripting (which won't teach you anything) will fill well over that. It gives very good coverage of HTML and good scripting and css sections (it has two screenshots showing how all the text related css attributes are rendered in Internet Explorer and Netscape).<P> The latter part of the book is devoted to a lot of Internet Explorer specific technologies that could be of use a lot of use to people developing intranet sites.<P> This book details many features that work in Internet Explorer and not in the latest Netscape product. HOWEVER, that is to be expected since Netscape has not released a new browser in several years. The advantage of this book is that it doesn't present the user with a just one feature set-it lets the reader know what things work and what don't in each browser, although there is a focus on the Microsoft product. In some cases it even details how the Mozilla betas differ from the released Netscape browser and it mentions Opera a couple of times.</span>
