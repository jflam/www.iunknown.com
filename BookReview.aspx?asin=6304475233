                <span id="Label1">Filmed during a brutal drought in central Africa, this brilliantly photographed video from <I>National Geographic</I> follows the punishing predicament of animals living along the dwindling Luvuvhu River. As the water level sinks during the dry season, animals, including baboons and impalas, are forced to seek water in pools filled with hippos and deadly crocodiles. At one point the crocodiles, who are the focus of the filming, are described as "artists of violence," and the term seems entirely apt when they are seen striking out with lightning speed from places of total concealment in the water and mud. As the camera lingers on the watering hole, the behavior of increasingly desperate and thirsty animals is shown in all its brutal detail, and portions of this video will have the squeamish averting their eyes. Even though the violent outbursts are handled as tastefully as possible (it is, after all, a <I>National Geographic</I> production), some scenes, such as a violent confrontation between crocodiles and baboons, are heartrending. And while some of the video is inevitably difficult to watch, the photography is always spectacular; some of the shots, such as scenes of a baby hippo blithely wallowing among the crocodiles under the mother hippo's watchful eye, are astounding.  This video is both brutal and beautiful, and puts the viewer as close as possible (and desirable) to some of Africa's most amazing wildlife. <I>--Robert J. McNamara</I></span>

                    <span>This was a brilliantly made documentary about the relationships between different animals on the brink of survival. Definitely one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.</span>

                    <span>I don't think this film is as violent as some suggest. Although there are several shots of crocodiles lunging onto land an striking out at prey, most of the killing is implied. The interaction between animals in this documentary is fascinating, particularly the hippo-croc relationship. At one point in the film, a mother hippo nudges her baby into a feeding frenzy of writhing crocs. Of course the crocodiles wouldn't dare harm the offspring of a two ton parent. And although we see some violence in the animals, we also see a lighter side with a croc and her babies, and two determined birds doing their best to protect their young. The confrontation between baboon and crocodile mentioned above is not so heart-wrenching when you consider that the baboons are also predators. One scene with a fawn comes to mind. Overall, Last Feast of the Crocodiles is an intriguing look at wildlife during harsh times, and the strength of survivors.</span>

                    <span>I do not find this documentary to be so much about crocodiles as the struggle to survive. As the pool shrinks animals are forced into ever more brutal circumstances fighting for a small drink of water in what is ultimately a futile battle. This documentary is well shot and beautifully written and I applaud the filmmakers. Sometimes everything comes together in a film and this is one of those wonderful occasions. And, as in all great films, this one manages to say far more than just what it is showing on the screen.</span>

                    <span>The croc kill footage here is for the most part not the best I've ever seen and not the reason to buy this video. What it's really about is how the animals of Africa react to a particularly bad drought, and it's one of the best of it's kind. This is also for hippo fans, showing some pretty bizzare behavior on their part that another NG special will hopefully someday be able to explain.</span>

                    <span>While this was not the best Crocodile movie I have in my video library, it was very enjoyable. It focuses on the life and death struggles of a number of different African species as they try to survive a record drought that slowly dries up the last water in a normally flourishing river. While the crocodiles have the lead roles, other animals are also followed closely such as the enormous African Hippos. While not a "must see" it is definitely worth the price.</span>
