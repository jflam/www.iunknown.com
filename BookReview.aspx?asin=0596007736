                    <span>... and a solid "Java in a Nutshell" is one of them. What can I say? I started with v1.1 and have bought every version up to v5.0.
<br />I can relate to the main complaint of the other reviews: the book's  size. I agree that the second half of the book parrots the JavaDoc, but it is somewhat different and helpful, especially if you've grown used to looking through it to find stuff.
<br />I don't know what the answer is. Hey, I have an idea: blame Sun, not David. At the risk of getting flamed and/or flack, I have oftentimes thought that the Java language is just growing out of control. Some might argue that we need all of this stuff. Perhaps that is true, but is it really worth the hit that each and every developer takes every time they try to find something is this vast ocean of APIs?
<br />Ahh, remember the good old days of K&R "C"?</span>

                    <span>Recently, Sun gave us a significant upgrade to Java - the release of Java 5. A slew of the inevitable bug fixes. But also key new features, as explained here by Flanagan in the 5th edition of his long running reference. 
<br />
<br />Some new abilities lead to notational simplification, like autoboxing. So if k is an Integer, you can now say "k=5" instead of the clumsier "k=new Integer(5)". With a similar inverse process if q is an int, of being able to write "q=k" rather than "q=k.intValue()". Though of course the older forms are still valid, for backward compatibility.
<br />
<br />Hey, varargs are now allowed! Much to the pleasure of some of you who came from C programming and used this nice feature. Ever since Java came out, there has been a continual, albeit quiet, push for varargs. Finally!
<br />
<br />By now, experienced Java programmers may be familiar with earlier versions of the book. There may be mild astonishment at the sheer heft of this edition. Thanks to its popularity, Java has bulked up in the number and scope of its classes. The book is a reassuring sign of Java's vitality.</span>

                    <span>Here's a classic that just keeps on keep up with the state of the language...  Java In A Nutshell (5th Edition) by David Flanagan (O'Reilly).  But it's definitely getting pretty large...
<br />
<br />Rather than list the chapters like I usually do, I'll forego that this time in that I'll probably overrun the Amazon word limit.  Suffice it to say that if it's a core part of the Java language as of version 5.0, it's probably in here...
<br />
<br />The good stuff...  Flanagan has once again done an outstanding job in providing a succinct reference manual that covers the latest version of the Java language.  He's added a new chapter to cover Java 5.0 features such as generic types, enumerated types, and annotations.  There is also coverage of some new features in chapter 2, such as autoboxing and the new for/in statement.  This coverage method (most of the new stuff in one area) means that readers who are upgrading their copy can easily flag the new material they need to read.  And rather than keep a lot of older material floating around, he's also eliminated some language features that are either deprecated or are not widely used.  Granted, if *you* are one of the few using it, that's not good, but you have to draw a line somewhere.  Other than that, it's the same solid, no-fluff coverage of the Java language in the first 400 pages that you've come to expect in this Nutshell volume.  The reminder of the 1200+ pages covers Java API documentation, which is useful if you're looking for a particular method or property you're not familiar with.
<br />
<br />The bad part is probably the page count...  Although the print is small and the information is packed tightly, 1200 pages still makes for a pretty thick book.  Some will make the argument that you can get the last 800 pages (the API documentation) on-line, which is true.  I tend to prefer having pages I can flip through without having to do a lot of hyperlinking.  Plus you can jot down notes or flag certain parts you reference quite often.  I'm almost of the opinion that perhaps it's now time to split the book into Java In A Nutshell - volumes 1 and 2.  Put the API info in a second volume and make it easier to work with...
<br />
<br />I still think this is a "must have" book for any Java programmer...  It just may be time to take a hard look at the packaging for the 6th edition.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the review above.  It's a great book but the part II API Quick Reference is too much to be included.  If they were split and available for purchase separately, you would have a much better product.  That said, Part I is really good!</span>

                    <span>As far as the information inside the book goes, it's a great book that describes the basics of Java in a simple, here's what you need to know format.  It describes everything you need to know about Java syntax, objects, etc, etc, etc.  The big reason to get this is for the Java 5.0 info, which is scattered throughout Chapter 2.  There is also Chapter 4, which goes into more detail on some of the more interesting features of Java 5.0.
<br />
<br />However, the bulk of the 1200+ pages are essentially the javadoc, with some additional notes.  In thumbing around and looking at random class descriptions, I didn't see anything I couldn't get from the javadoc.  This is obviously a personal preference - if you like the hardcopy, it might work for you.  It just seems like a waste to me.  
<br />
<br />I would have been much happier with the first 400 pages and a note on page 401 that said "buy another book if you need the apis" or "go read the javadoc".  A 400 page Nutshell book I can throw in the backpack, thumb through, and carry around.  A 1200 page Nutshell (like Java 5.0 for that matter) seems to be suffering from a bit of unnecessary bloat.</span>
