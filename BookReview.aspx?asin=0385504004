                <span id="Label1">&#191;Like any good classicist, Victor Davis Hanson accepts the primacy of military history in human affairs. In 'Ripples of Battle,' a sequel of sorts to his masterful 'Carnage and Culture,' he shows the fascinating repercussions of three lesser-known battles. You cannot fully understand Hiroshima, the bitterness of the Old South, or the Golden Age of Athens without reading this gem of a book.&#191; <br>--Robert D. Kaplan <br><br><br>"Victor Davis Hanson is one of our leading military historians, and in 'Ripples of Battle' he does not disappoint.  A far-reaching story of man, war, and history, it is, by turns, iconoclastic, touching, deeply learned, and endlessly fascinating. This slim book is a grand study."<br>--Jay Winik, author of <i>April 1865: The Month That Saved America<br></i><br>&#191;Victor Davis Hanson has earned a well-deserved reputation as one of the most interesting and innovative military historians in the world. In 'Ripples of Battle,' he shows once again why he&#191;s the best. He ranges far and wide, from World War II to the wars of ancient Greece. Along the way he combines a born storyteller&#191;s gift for rip-roaring battle narrative with a scholar&#191;s attention to the deeper meaning of conflict. Once again he manages to take what may seem familiar and to show it in an utterly new light. The &#191;ripples&#191; that he identifies&#191;which include characters as disparate as Socrates and the author of Ben Hur&#191;astonish and delight. This book is not only deeply enlightening but also a sheer pleasure to read. It is, in short, vintage Victor.&#191; <br>--Max Boot, Olin senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of <i>The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power</i><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></span>

                    <span>Each human life has an impact on others, creating ripples that eventually affect future generations. Here, Hanson (classics, California State Univ., Fresno; The Western Way of War) argues that the outcomes of certain battles have had far-reaching effects on American culture. He chooses the battles of Okinawa (1945, World War II), Shiloh (1862, U.S. Civil War), and the lesser-known Delium (424 B.C.E., Peloponnesian War) and shows their impact on how Americans fight, live, and think. As Hanson explains, the chance survival of certain individuals and the death of others had repercussions reaching into the 21st century. The book is well written, and the sections on Okinawa and Shiloh are clear and easy to read. The section on Delium will challenge those not familiar with the time period, but the arguments are lucid, and Hanson convincingly demonstrates that the impact of this obscure battle is the most profound of the three. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries</span>

                    <span>When we think of battle, we usually think of the effect that the engagement has in the outcome of the war, or perhaps how a specific general excels or disgraces himself. Seldom do we think of what effect such a battle may have on the outside world. Sometimes, the only effect is on the relatives of those fallen in battle. Other times, however, there are wider repercussions.<P>Ripples of Battle, by Victor Davis Hanson, doesn't quite live up to what the cover promises, which is a shame. Its subtitle is "How wars of the past still determine how we fight, how we live, and how we think." Unfortunately, the book isn't quite as far-ranging as this sounds. It covers three battles: the American invasion of Okinawa in World War II, the battle of Shiloh in the American Civil War, and the battle of Delium in 422 BC. In looking at these battles, Hanson discusses some of the aftereffects they had on western society. This is fine, and actually quite interesting, but the title makes the book sound like a broad sociological text and the innards don't quite deliver this.<P>Once I got past these preconceived notions, I actually found the book quite fascinating. Hanson begins by discussing the bloodbath that was the battle of Okinawa. The Japanese garrison of 110,000 troops was almost completely wiped out, fighting to the last man. The Americans themselves lost over 15,000 men with over 33,000 wounded. The Japanese garrison had no illusions that they could defeat the Americans at this point in the war, but that didn't matter. Instead, they meant to take as many Americans with them as they could. While suicidal banzai charges and kamikaze aircraft attacks were periodic occurrences before, Okinawa saw the first instances of organized suicide attacks. The sole purpose of every Japanese soldier was to take as many Americans with him as possible. This is obviously a ripple that has affected the waters of the modern day, with suicide bombers blowing themselves up for a cause. What the modern day bombers seem to have missed from this history lesson, however, is the fact that it did not work. The Americans were not stopped at Okinawa. They did not sue for peace, horrified at the losses they took. Instead, their determination was strengthened and they forged ahead. This is one of the major facets of the Okinawa campaign, though Hanson does discuss others.<P>As interesting as these stories were, however, I found the Shiloh history to be even more fascinating. Shiloh was, up to that point, the bloodiest day in the Civil War. It also resulted in the rise in stature of General Sherman, who eventually began the strategy of economic warfare, burning his way through the Confederate economy while killing relatively few people. General Lew Wallace was disgraced at Shiloh, and he spent the rest of his life trying to clear his name. One way he did this was by writing the novel Ben-Hur. Nathan Bedford Forrest, a southern cavalry officer, also rose to prominence on that fateful day, and he became one of the driving forces behind the Ku Klux Klan. There were also others. This entire chapter is just one fascinating insight after another, and Hanson does an admirable job of presenting everything in a clear, concise manner. <P>There is one problem with Ripples of Battle, however, and that is the final chapter. The battle between the Athenians and the Boeotians of Thebes does not follow the theme of the book as closely, and isn't as interesting either. The main problem is the discussion of Socrates, who was one of the few Athenian survivors of the battle. Hanson spends an entire section of the final chapter discussing what would have happened to western philosophy, from Socrates himself to Plato and elsewhere, if he had died. This falls into the realm of "what-if" though, and doesn't fit. The rest of the book deals with real and unforeseen consequences to the battles in question. Since Socrates didn't die, it has no place here. The rest of the chapter does fit, however, with the first instance of real infantry tactics and the future effects on Athens from various survivors of the battle. Hanson fails to make it interesting, though, constantly repeating himself (especially in the Socrates section) and generally making it a chore to read.<P>Hanson redeems himself, however, with an interesting epilogue that ties the whole book together, though he does suffer from repetition yet again. He discusses the various impacts battles can have on us as a society, and how there are so many different reasons that a given battle can affect us. Sometimes it's the accessibility of the history, sometimes it's who's involved (if Socrates had not been involved in the battle of Delium, much of it, if any, would not have been recorded). Hanson relates a lot of what he's discussed to the World Trade Center attacks and the current war on terrorism. We do not know how current violence, like the genocide in Rwanda, will affect us as time goes on, but we can make a supposition based on how it's happened in the past. <P>Battles will continue to be an important part of history, and Hanson is trying to show the importance of studying them. The study of history has changed to a study of cultural trends, which Hanson believes is incomplete. The point of this book is to show how the study of great men (and women) and how they fight each other can still be an important aspect of history. In The Ripples of Battle, he does an effective job, creating a fascinating read as well.<P>David Roy</span>

                    <span>I thought Victor Hanson's theory is interesting and in a way profound. In essence, the author proposes that everyone knows about the major battles, and major battles have impact since they usually impact the outcome a war, but they minor battles can create ripples in history that have an effect on future events that may be more signficant than the battles everyone knows about.<P>The author selects the Battle of Okinawa, The Battle of Shiloh, and the Battle of Delium. The ripple effects are derived from the impact these battles had on the participants. To most people, these battles are minor and obscure. Okinawa shouldn't be, but was overshadowed by other events.<P>The key point of Okinawa (aside from the author's personal interest, a relative died there) was western culture's reaction to suicide bombings that Japanese used in the battle and the significance of the desire to fight to the last regardless of the outcome. The Japanese were fighting to extract casualties and for strategic advantage. The hope was to deter the imminent invasion of the home islands. The ripple here is the parallel of what we might do faced with Islamic extremists. In WWII, we used the A-Bomb on Japan, and Afganistan we are using Daisy Cutters.<P>In Shiloh, which probably the author's strongest argument, the battle impacted the pyschology of the south (The Lost Opportunity), the key focus of two generals ideas about prosecuting the war (Sherman and Grant), and how in a few moments careers are made and broken (Lew Wallace). All of these had impact far beyond the battle, the war, and the century. <P>Victor Hanson is an excellent writer and brings and interesting perspective to the subject. This is a very good book and well worth reading, it will make you think. (Chaos theory which an example is the fluttering of a butterfly in China impacts the weather in North America.)</span>

                    <span>Edward Shepherd Creasy's classic Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World would seem to be the prototype of this book. But Dr. Hanson's theme is more subtle than merely listing the big hinges of fate. The battles he picks caused less dramatic but still far-ranging influence on our policies and even our attitudes. It's a very interesting read, as are all of VDH's writings.<P>I don't quite go along with some of the suppositions. Sherman's march to the sea was far from the first punitive campaign in history, though he persuades me that Shiloh caused Sherman to take up that style of war. The battle of Delium's influence must have been very subtle indeed, as the connecting thread is vanishingly faint, to my mind. Invoking a what-if influence, of Socrates possibly having been killed in that battle, is cheating; for by that standard any battle that any future famous person survived would have to count as an influential battle.<P>The Shiloh section is best for the account of how careers were launched and scuttled, how reputations were born, and how myths were created. His description of how the savagery of the fighting on Okinawa greased the skids for the deployment of the atom bombs is well done. The Imperial Japanese expected a bloodbath, expected Okinawa to fall, but did not expect that their show of suicidal fanaticism would prompt the Americans to one-up their brutality. And that's what stopped the war and, according to Hanson, provides precedent for Americans to escalate the modern War on Terror way beyond what the jihadists bargained for.<P>Hanson's storytelling powers and erudition are wonderfully entertaining, whether you agree with his points or not. The book's a bargain simply for the history lessons.</span>

                    <span>A new book by VDH is always an interesting event. Never fearful of being controversial he is a nightmare for the Politically Correct crowd of cultural relivist historians. In "Ripples" VDH looks at three separate and distinct battles and draws fascinating conclusions from each. While not related to each other in any way, VDH shows how each has left a lasting impression on society. <P>At Okinawa VHD shows that that desperate fanaticism that the Japanese embarked upon was truly a forelorn hope. If the 9/11 terrorists have looked to the Japanese for inspiration in sucide attacks, then they have drawn the wrong conclusions. As a result of this battle, the US determined that it must use atomic weapons against the Japanese in order to end the war swiftly and without further loss. An invasion of the Japanese mainland would have resulted in far greater loss for both sides. VHD shows us that we should feel no shame for dropping the bomb on Japan. If we are to understand why we did so one need only look at the carnage of Okinawa. If seen wthin the context of the times, the policy becomes clear. Too many revisionist historians tend to ignore that fact today.<P>At Shiloh VHD pulls together a number of famous individuals who would have profound impact on the Civil War and its legacy in the US. Sherman, Lew Wallace, Grant and Forest all would be major players in the war, and Shiloh helped to eastablish that fact. For Sherman it was the carnage of the batttle that would define his strategy of maneauver against the South resulting in the epic March to the Sea. Forest and Wallace would leave different legacies, each of what prove fascinating to understanding the nature of late 19th century US development.<P>The battle of Delium in 424 BC may not at first seem relivant. But the fact that Socretes was there makes for some wonderful speculation on VHD's part. If he had died how would this have chnaged Western Philosophy? Some may find this a silly point to debate, but the issue seems quite profound. Such a death would have left a big ripple indeed! The battle also shows development in Greek Hoplite warfare as Pagondas uses what would become a version of the oblique attack with his Thebans against the Athenians.<P>Taken all together this is a fun and fascinating book. Not for the Left Wing set, although they could learn a lot from reading it! VHD shows that warfare has always been a part of humanity, and that we are niave to think we can shy away from it today. His messages has special meaning in this post-911 world.</span>
