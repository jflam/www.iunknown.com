                <span id="Label1">&#8220;John Carney is one of the few heroes I have.&#8221;<br>&#8211;LT. COL. L. H. &#8220;BUCKY&#8221; BURRUSS, USA (Ret.)<br>   Founding member and Deputy Commander of Delta Force<b><i><br></i></b><br>When the U.S. Air Force decided to create an elite &#8220;special tactics&#8221; team in the late 1970s to work in conjunction with special-operations forces combating terrorists and hijackers and defusing explosive international emergencies, John T. Carney was the man they turned to. Since then Carney and the U.S. Air Force Special Tactical units have circled the world on sensitive clandestine missions. They have operated behind enemy lines gathering vital intelligence. They have combated terrorists and overthrown dangerous dictators. They have suffered many times the casualty rate of America&#8217;s conventional forces.  But they have gotten the job done&#8211;most recently in stunning victories in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, which Carney calls &#8220;America&#8217;s first special-operations war.&#8221; Now, for the first time, Colonel Carney lifts the veil of secrecy and reveals what <i>really</i> goes on inside the special-operations forces that are at the forefront of contemporary warfare.<br><br>Part memoir, part military history, <i>No Room for Error </i>reveals how Carney, after a decade of military service, was handpicked to organize a small, under-funded, classified ad hoc unit known as Brand X, which even his boss knew very little about. Here Carney recounts the challenging missions: the secret reconnaissance in the desert of north-central Iran during the hostage crisis; the simple rescue operation in Grenada that turned into a prolonged bloody struggle. With Operation Just Cause in Panama, the Special Tactical units scored a major success, as they took down the corrupt regime of General Noriega with lightning speed. Desert Storm was another triumph, with Carney&#8217;s team carrying out vital search-and-rescue missions as well as helping to hunt down mobile Scud missiles deep inside Iraq.<br><br>Now with the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, special operations have come into their own, and Carney includes a chapter detailing exactly how the Air Force Special Tactics d.c. units have spearheaded the successful campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  <br><br>Gripping in its battle scenes, eye-opening in its revelations, <i>No Room for Error </i>is the first insider&#8217;s account of how special operations are changing the way modern wars are fought. Col. John T. Carney is an airman America can be proud of, and he has written an absolutely superb book.</span>

                    <span>Along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, in the Mekong delta, and in the air, the U.S. military's special operations forces played key roles in Vietnam. After being neglected by the regular military bureaucracy for most of the quarter-century that followed, U.S. special ops forces finally got the appreciation and credit they deserved when a few hundred very smart and superbly-trained men engineered the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. This book is largely about the period in between Vietnam and the post-9/11campaign, and it fills an important gap in the literature. It focuses particularly on the U.S. Air Force's Special Tactics Units, who are an essential part of the larger special ops picture, and who make many missions possible through their extraordinary skils at getting teams in and out of dangerous territory, often at night and without being detected by the enemy. This book is full of revelations, and is highly recommended to anyone interested in the field.</span>

                    <span>Col. John T. Carney, USAF (ret.) takes the reader through his professional career and the history of U.S. Air Force special tactics units from the early 1980s through 2002.<P>Special Tactics, which has operated in most every American military action since Operation Eagle Claw (aka Desert One) in 1980, has its foundations in the Pathfinder units of WW2, and are often known as 'combat controllers.' They are often the first in and the last out.<P>In a frank and engaging manner, Carney lays out the history of special tactics and their operations, including Eagle Claw, Grenada, Panama, Achille Lauro, Desert Storm, and Somalia, through Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Given his firsthand involvement in the majority of these operations, Carney offers a unique perspective and pulls no punches in his assessment of Air Force and U.S. Special Operations. Nothing is glossed-over and the reader gets the sense that Carney bears more self-imposed crosses than he probably should.<P>If you are interested in a unique perspective of U.S. Special Operations and Air Force Special Tactics, this book should not be missed.</span>

                    <span>I'm about 2/3 done with this book. I previously read Black Hawk Down, and picked up this book next. While Black Hawk Down makes you feel like you are in the middle of the action, this book reads more like a documentary. You never quite feel for the heroes the author writes about; you never quite understand who they are, what their personalities are like, are what these people have gone through. Instead, its almost as if you are watching a black-and-white movie and are set far back away from the action. There's a lot of facts, and a lot of names. Names of people that not too many people (at least today) know about. The main point of the book seems to be that Special Operations has really grown up in America, and that frankly it was really disorganized before.</span>

                    <span>I am a combat control apprentice right now and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Special Operations or just want to understand them better. It is written in a historical format that presented facts more than a dramatic style. <P>I am very proud to be doing what I am doing after reading this book. It really brings Air Force Special Ops out and presents it for everyone to read. There are still many people in the military including those in the Air Force or don't know what Combat Controllers or PJ's are. Since combat control is such a new unit, news programs often credit other unit forces with tasks that were performed by AFSOC (Air Force Special Operations Command) units.</span>

                    <span>I enjoy military books immensely, and this book seemed right up my alley. I like those books that you can not put down, where you feel like you are right there in the middle of the action. This book, however, is written in a historical manner which presents lots of facts, names and who did this, who went where info. There is very little first-person action where conflicts are described and you feel part of the battle. Great book, well written, just not what I was looking for.</span>
