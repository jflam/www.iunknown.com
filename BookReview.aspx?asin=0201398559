                <span id="Label1">The third edition of Alan Watt's <I>3D Computer Graphics</I>, a bible of computer graphics, includes a CD-ROM full of examples and updated information on graphics and rendering algorithms. The book discusses many of the techniques that have evolved in the seven years since the previous edition was published.<p> <I>3D Computer Graphics</I> is a textbook, and it's designed for serious programmers creating graphics applications (not end users). Over the course of 16 sections, Watt introduces the concepts and implementation of computer imaging, from "Mathematical Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" to "Representation and Rendering" and ending with "Image-Based Rendering and Photo-Modeling." The last section, devoted to computer animation, includes methods for linked structures, collision detection, and particle animation (to name a few).<p> Although the topics are sometimes hard to grasp, Mr. Watt writes clearly and concisely, making generous use of diagrams to help convey the principles described in the text.<p> The accompanying CD-ROM includes over a dozen studies of computer graphics techniques and rendering algorithms. Presented in HTML, the exhaustive studies, each with a matrix of thumbnails, demonstrates the varied achievable results. One minor complaint here: although the thumbnails can be clicked to view a much larger image, the larger versions come in .tif format, which few (if any) Web browsers can view. Users will need another application to view them. Having the large image in .jpg format would have enabled the reader to view it in the already-open Web browser.<p> <I>3D Computer Graphics</I> is ideally suited to graphics programmers and researchers working to create new medical imaging devices; geological research systems; virtual structural testing systems for aircraft, cars, and spacecraft; or effects and photorealistic Hollywood animation. <I>--Mike Caputo</I></span>

                    <span>I am a junior student at Computer Engineering major. I am taking a computer graphics course and unfortunately, the instructor chose this title as the textbook. 
<br />
<br />I am not saying it is a bad book or something, but it is targeted to people who have some experience with computer graphics.... (e.g: for people doing graduate studies in computer graphics) As for me, my first encounter with computer graphics in this book made me hate the topic so much. The book makes you feel that graphics involve so much mathematics, especially analytic geometry. It is so hard as an introduction to the topic of Computer Graphics.
<br />
<br />I would not recommend this book at all as an introduction to computer graphics, it may be good for those who have some (actually a lot) of experience in this so advanced topic.</span>

                    <span>I have an earlier version of this book and I've always found it to be one that I return to time and again.  It was one of the first three graphics programming books I bought during the same early career book shopping session, it was definately the most useful of the three and it's stayed with me ever since, where other books have been and gone.<p>It's generally very easy to read and very informative.  It has a good progression of topics that introduce the reader to graphics programming concepts.<p>The thing I most like about this is that it covers much of the foley and van dam book, but avoids the many irrelevant sections and is a little more to the point.  It's like a more concise reference to that book, which is also one that I would recommend.<p>The only thing I don't like about the updated version is the new layout, typeface and style.  The old version just seems so much more appealing to me.<p>If you program game or computer graphics, then this is a reliable book to have in your collection.</span>

                    <span>Contrary to what the other reviews say, I believe this is an excellent book for beginners in the 3D computer graphics world.  However, that being said, you will need some basic math skills to be able to understand and apply the concepts in this book.  If you are unfamilar with linear algebra, you should probably start with studying up on your math skills first.  With the basic math skills, this book does a great job of introducing the basics to almost every major topic you'll see in 3D computer graphics programming.  The book doesn't go into great detail at times, but the simplicity of this book is the winning ingredient that allows beginners to grasp the basics before moving on to indepth research in paticular topics of 3D graphics that interest them.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book for all those who want to delve into the theory and process of computer graphics. Some basic concepts are covered in vague detail, and some other reading into concepts such as vector maths, are required. But it provides a solid foundation for programmers, artists, and the alike. The book is not terribly detailed, thus may not serve the purposes of an advance CG artist. But regardless, a book that I will be refering to a lot.</span>
