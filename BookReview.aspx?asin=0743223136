                    <span>The true mastery of McCullough is his ability to disrupt our stagnant ideas of historical figures by masterfully integrating letters, quips, and text into an inspiring tableau of past times.
<br />
<br />Descriptions, for example, of Adam's brave and stealthy voyages by sea in the dead of winter; the perils he and his young son endured at sea...leaking vessels, rolling seas, lightening distroying a mast and killnig a crew member, and a battle with the Brits bring to life the true heroism of the early Americans that we oft take for granted or forget alltogether.
<br />
<br />Adams was  not just a stodgy old man in a wig with a quill in is hand. He was a hardworking farmer , and early advocate of the abolishment of slavery (unlike both Franklin and Jefferson) a man of immense and unwavering integrity, a true intelliectual, mastering several languages and the art of diplomacy.
<br />
<br />He survived great illness, dangerous journeys here and abroad, cared deeply for his children and had a fullfilling and marvelous marriage to Abigail, a truly porgressive and opionated woman.
<br />
<br />This book will capture your heart and soul. Adams, was not dramatic in the vein of Jefferson or Franklin, nor was he a war hero such as Washington. Nevertheless, it is probabale the United States would likely not exist if not for the forward governmental thinking and steely resolve of John Adams.

                    <span>John Adams rose from humble origins as the son of a deacon in Braintree, Massachusetts to become a leader of the American colonists' revolutionary cause and, ultimately, the second president of a fledgling nation struggling to find its way on the world scene.  Historian David McCullough draws on thousands of private letters and journal entries to provide a comprehensive look at Adams' life.  The resulting biography, enthralling as any of its genre, deserves every award it has received, from the countless prizes given to it by historical societies all the way up to the Pulitzer.
<br />
<br />McCullough's masterpiece comes in three sections.  First, he tells the story of the Revolutionary War from Adams' perspective.  Adams served diligently on both Continental Congresses, and eventually the long, thankless hours took their toll.  The committee meetings, the wrangling over insignificant measures, and the long separation from his wife, who he loved deeply, drove him to exhaustion and despair.  He stoically withstood the test, however, and emerged with a lofty reputation as one of the continent's great champions of liberty.  Next, McCullough delves into the time Adams spent abroad on various diplomatic missions on behalf of a government that had not yet won the fight for its existence.  During this part of his life Adams undertook adventures of which he never thought himself capable.  He made a treacherous six-week voyage to France to negotiate a treaty of alliance during the brutal winter of 1778, braving the deadly North Atlantic on a creaking navy frigate.  His European exploits took him from France to Spain to London to Amsterdam, and he dutifully recorded his impressions in journal entries that, when sprinkled among McCullough's colorful tidbits of commentary, make for fascinating reading.  When Adams finally came home to a new nation, he found the cheeks of his countrymen flush from triumph against the world's greatest empire.  The impending battles between Federalists anti-Federalists, however, soon polarized the nation's political landscape, and Adams played a central role in the task of building a nation amidst such bitter controversy.
<br />
<br />Curiously, although Adams accomplished as much as anyone to guide the country through troubled times, Washington and Jefferson ended up dwarfing him in their presidential reputations.  Luckily, McCullough's biography came along to restore the balance.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is simply one of the best biographies I have ever read. It goes into great detail in a refreshing style in four important periods of Adams' life: The Continental Congress up through 1776; the residency abroad as United States minister to England and Holland; the Presidency; and the retirement.
<br />
<br />In all of the periods important relationships are traced, especially those with Jefferson, Abigail Adams, and sons John Quincy and Charles, allowing the reader to see evolutions of these relationships rather than a static description of them.
<br />
<br />Finally, the scholarship is impeccable. A true delight to read.</span>

                    <span>David McCullough sets up each event and chapter by providing the reader a perspective about the life and times of the revolutionary period. He draws the reader into the events by vividly describing the scenes, the weather, the geography and the political and philosophical biases of the characters and the countries of the times. During the final chapters of the book, I felt as if I was a member of the Adams family feeling both the anguish and accomplishments that he so eloquently describes. Initially, I was planning on reading only John Adams, but now I want to read every book this author has written.</span>

                    <span>It is amazing to think of the process through which we might pick up a mass of paper and thumb through the life of a man who so profoundly influenced the modern world though he lived nearly two centuries ago. Needless to say, this book drew me into the depths of a mind and life that was so unfamiliar to me previously. Through Adams' correspondence to his friends, his opponents, his family, and his love, (as displayed throughout the book) we have a general sense that the voice of Adams is indeed speaking through McCullough.
<br />It seemed as if I was reading the autobiography that John Adams never wrote.
<br />
<br />This work travels through some of the most difficult and defining years of the United States of America and provides an insight into the contributions that John and Abigail Adams made to the prosperity of a nation. I think that the author recreates situations and circumstances wherein we are allowed to laugh, smile, become angry, and even mourn with both the Adams. If nothing else, we learn so much about the revolutionary period and the founding of our nation because John Adams lived through it all. This book may move you in a sincere way.
<br />
<br />What bars me from giving this work a 5 star rating rather than 4 is one of the very reasons that I love this book - the apparent lack of objectivity as evidenced through the author's love and fascination for John Adams. Being the case, I would give it 4 ½ if allowed. Essentially, we are given a view of Adams' life through (more or less) the lens of Adams own eyes. 
<br />
<br />Apart from my only qualm, the book is very readable. As mentioned in a prior review, McCullough is a wonderful storyteller - he draws a picture of Adams, his times, and his experiences so well that you can see it all when you close your eyes. There are very few areas where this book becomes an arduous read. It is a wonderful portrait of a wonderful man, a historical and educational piece worth your time, and great accomplishment to which you may tell your friends, "Yes, I did read through the 656 pages of this book (the other 95 are notes, the bibliography, and the index)." McCullough leaves no question as to why he is a Pulitzer Prize winner.
