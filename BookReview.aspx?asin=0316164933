                    <span>If you are looking for a lot of information about ebay in one place, this is pretty good. I agree with a previous poster who said that it was a bit disjointed. For example, the complete story of the Christian woman who came to work at ebay under humble circumstances, and then was promoted to head of the eBay foundation takes about 3-4 pages, but it's spread out over 2/3 of the book. There are many stories that are interwoven piecemeal through the book that it takes away from the sense of chronological progression of the story. 
<br />
<br />
<br />This book definitely has a neutral to positive spin. If you're looking for ebay bashing this isn't it. </span>

                    <span>As sexy as the story of eBay's success is, so is the story of how it almost failed, on numerous occasions at that. Cohen's book is both astute and honest in its rendering of an Internet leviathan's near drowning. One of the best dot.com books I've read and trust me, there are plenty of them.</span>

                    <span>This might be the best book I've ever read... not that no other books I've read weren't very good... but this book, in addition to being absolutely enthralling from Page 1, was incredibly inspiring to me too.  I learned about Pierre Omidyar's start from AuctionWeb's modest beginnings in a bedroom of his townhouse... and seeing eBay where it is today, dominating the online market and worth over 20 billion dollars.  
<br />
<br />If you are interested in the internet, business, entrepreneurship, and/or the American Dream, then this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>Upon finishing this book I was amazed at the detail Adam Cohen presented to readers about the real inside of eBay. The book travels through time playing on various aspects of the company and reasons to why it became and still is one of the world's most admired and successful companies. Sure, eBay has changed the marketplace as we know it and sure it has affected many lives. But the key element in this story is that one guy's vision of a community, free from obstructing walls, became a reality - something many .com companies failed to achieve. A wonderful read...highly recommended for all!</span>

                    <span>As a frequent user of eBay, I always wondered little things like how the site came to be and why is it called eBay... This book answers those questions.  While reading this I was fascinated about how eBay has influenced so many things outside of the internet.  The book details the humble beginnings of eBay by one person and his ideals.  Along the way it shares stories about the sometimes quirky personalities that have helped make eBay the powerhouse that it is today.  It also chronicles the whole dot com era and mentions other players such as Amazon and Yahoo.  The book is surprisingly interesting.  I don't usually read "business" books but this one I finished in 2 days.  I would highly recommend this if you are interested in eBay, the internet, or the internet's influence on everyday life.</span>
