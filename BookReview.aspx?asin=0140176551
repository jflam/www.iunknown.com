                    <span>Have you ever wondered how the teams at Microsoft work? This book is an inside glimpse into how a work group there operates. It is not a comprehensive view of Microsoft??? and in fact each group could be said to have its own unique dynamics, but this book will provide a brief and useful view of the process of creating and shipping a product at Microsoft. This book follows several members of a group within a now defunct section of Microsoft. They were creating a product, and the book documents each person???s feelings, opinions, and unique perspectives on getting their own jobs done??? and how they have to work together to accomplish the ultimate goal of creating a product. Microsoft employees, it is shown, have a great deal of personal freedom and latitude in doing their jobs, but when it comes to working together in a team, their very idiosyncratic personalities often conflict. Add to this a very strange but not surprising element of artists versus programmers versus project managers. Add yet more??? regular Microsoft employees versus contract employees. Whether the friction and problems the book conveys are real or not, they are perceived by many employees, which affects the work environment. An interesting aspect of the business model and organizational chart is that the employees are only a few levels (3 or 4) away from Bill Gates (or the highest level of the company). Most people at some point in their careers are required to present their work to Gates (or equivalent level) at some point. The book depicts Gates as a very temperamental and demanding person who will look at something which is next to perfect, get angry about its flaws, and yell at the creators insisting on something much better. And then when the presentation is over and the creators leave, Gates says something about how brilliant it was, but if people think he did not like it, they will strive to make it more perfect. The book might be dated by now. Organizations change a great deal in just a few years. Microsoft was not being threatened by the Justice Department when this book was written, and although MS was a huge company then it was not as big as it is now. The book is the first to point out the effects of organizational change, and Microsoft, like most large companies, goes through organizational change frequently. Interesting book... worthwhile read.</span>

And how software development basically involves dealing with different kinds of people. ANd all the extremes in personality of the programmer. It also describes the rare and challenging lifestyle that the programmer pursues and chooses...</span>

                    <span>The real value in this book is the great work that Fred did to get inside the development team, and then observe. I've worked at R&D in Microsoft for long enough to know that he probably is telling it largely as it happened. I didn't work on this project but I got pretty damned close.<p>Yep, it sometimes is that chaotic. It's interesting to see in the book how Fred doubts himself, and says things like "maybe I'm going crazy, but it seems like these people just had another useful offsite, but they all think it went great." Fred, you ain't crazy.<p>The only drawback of this book is that in places Fred tries to read into situations a bit too much. He steps a little too far out of the observer role a few times, which brings the quality down a bit. Also I think he missed a great opportunity to describe the turn-around (well at least they shipped something) at the end. Maybe he got kicked out around then?<p>The book has lots of direct quotes and first hand accounts of what went on. Want to see the dark side of things going wrong at Microsoft?? Read this book.</span>

                    <span>I got a copy of "I Sing the Body Electronic" as well as another  title by the author for my birthday, after a relative of mine happened to  strike up a conversation with Fred Moody at the airport while waiting for a  flight. My relative must have gotten on the topic of technology, because  she mentioned she was looking for a gift for an engineer (me), and Mr.  Moody suggested buying me his books (how egotistical).<p>Regardless, the  book is horrible. A book about a year with the Pennsylvania Dutch farmers  would be more captivating.<p>This book is supposedly textbook material for  college project management classes, however I'd have changed universities  if the one I was attending thought this is a worthy read. <p>The worst  aspect is I have to keep the book on my bookshelf in case of a "drop  in" from the person who gave it to me....sigh.</span>

                    <span>Very few detailed accounts of software projects are written skillfully,  dispassionately and with  deep understanding of the subject. Mr. Moody's book  belongs to this small group.  Aside from the disappointing Postmortem  chapter, which is not a real analysis, but a feel-good ending note, Mr.  Moody's work is a very worthy read. The author is an acute observer and a  first-class journalist.</span>
