                <span id="Label1">The superb pianist recorded this album, his second as a leader, in December 1958, more than two years after his debut. In between, of course, he was an integral part of Miles Davis's legendary sextet. Spurred by a rhythm section of bassist Sam Jones and drummer Philly Joe Jones, Bill Evans shows amazing versatility on these sides: his playing on "Minority," "Night and Day," and "Oleo" is surprisingly robust and even bluesy at times--certainly not adjectives usually associated with the cool pianist. He's delightfully playful on the midtempo "Tenderly." Then there are the slow, meditative numbers for which he's known, including three unaccompanied showcases. "Peace Piece," which was actually conceived merely as an introduction to Leonard Bernstein's "Some Other Time," is the most famous, but his reading of another Bernstein song, "Lucky to Be Me," is equally mesmerizing. Although the original record dropped it, the CD reissue does include a version of "Some Other Time," complete with the "Peace Piece" intro. <I>--Marc Greilsamer</I></span>

                    <span>I've listened to this CD many times, and it never fails to enthrall me. One of the things I love about Bill Evans is the care with which he seems to select each note. "Peace Piece" is still my favorite track, Bill seems to bare his soul on this one. Anyone interested in building a serious jazz collection would do well to start with this one. Go for the 20-bit remastered version, I have both versions, the 20-bit is cleaner.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This album reflects a crossroads in Bill's career. Bill had two current's flowing--his romantic style and his bop style. His prior album New Conceptions, which caused a stir, was almost a hard bop album. His lines at that point reflected Horace Silver's influence. Hard driving, mostly right hand extremely long lines; the ballads were somewhat arranged and not with his characteristic emotion. He knew he had more work to do (rec hiatus for almost 2 years)<br>With Everybody Digs however, Bill hit his stride. He had tempered and became more choice with his vocabulary-around this time he was a member of Miles Davis group. Oleo is a stunning effort. It is bop based, but it is a highly original take on it. None of his contemporaries were quite able to take the bebop idiom and loosen it up from Powell's reigns in terms of a new direction. This harder driving style on this record(a la All About Rosie/George Russell) as other reviewers commented seem to have been abandoned after the 50's. You see a little of it on Undercurrents on <br>Funny Valentine.<br>The ballads--lucky to be me, what is there to say. That ballad touch--so characteristic and identifiable was now permanently stamped to vinyl. And Peace, Peace is really a wild experiment with fantastic results. Bill could often be very tidy and preprogrammed but when he did odd things like this he really showed his unique depth. Another example of Bill's capricious and often humorous side can be seen on "With a Song in My Heart" from Empathy with Shelly Manne and Monty Budwig. Anybody interested in this period of bill's playing would be interested in checking out his work as a sideman with Dave Pike, Art Farmer, Charlie Mingus and Eddie Costa.</span>

                    <span>There may be a temptation to pass up this album in favor of the more "characteristic" Bill Evans of the later trios beginning with Lafaro and Motian. With a relentlessly swinging, earthy, "straight-ahead," bop and soul-oriented supportive team of Sam Jones and Philly Joe, Bill might be expected to fall into their insistent groove, providing at best a neo-Bud Powell impersonation. But the opposite is closer to the final result: the Jones' boys come under the spell of Evans' romantic, lyrical individualism. At the same time, Bill's lines are etched in bolder relief than is the case on the recordings of the later, more impressionistic and democratic trios. Take, for instance, "Night and Day." First, Philly Joe's tap dancing rhythms reference the musician for whom the song was written (Fred Astaire), then Sam lays down an irresistible dance beat, then Bill becomes the dancer--alternating between being a graceful, composite Fred-Ginger and a dazzling soloist, executing several stunning breaks without benefit of help from either accompanist.</span>

                    <span>From the opening chords of Gigi Gryce's "Minority" you know that this is going to be a good album.  During this 1958 session Evans clearly demonstrated why everybody was digging him.  The trio includes Philly Joe Jones on drums and Sam Jones on bass, and it explores the whole range of Evans' talent from the explosively lyrical to modal invention.  Bill Evans was simply a master of harmony and invention.  "Minority" starts the disc off at a quick tempo.  Evans turns out phrase after phrase supported by Philly Joe and Sam.  Evans and Philly Joe trade breaks that demonstrate their inventiveness ending with a subtle duet. "Young and Foolish" exemplifies Evans' ballad style.  His piano is heartbreakingly lyrical above Philly Joe's sensitive brush work.  Evans' solo pieces are exquisite.  In "Lucky to Be Me" his perfect sense of time, space, and harmony combine in a lyrical masterpiece. "Peace Peace" is a modal tone poem equal to anything Eric Satie composed--the clarity of bells, the stateliness of love.  The trio spins Cole Porter's "Night and Day" into another world--some straight ahead, some Latin--as Evans redefines the song in varied rhythmic contexts.  Evans' "Tenderly" swings lightly with Philly Joe and Sam laying down a firm support for his improvisation.  Just listen to the harmony!!  "What is There to Say?" does say a good deal between Evans' solo introduction and his evocative reinvention of the melody and subsequent commentary.  Sonny Rollins' "Oleo" shows Evans capable of hard bop--without loss of life or lyricism.  This could be Bud Powell, but it's Bill Evans swinging here--fresh, tight, and quick.  The bonus track on this album is "Some Other Time" another ballad treatment that favors exquisite modal harmonies--lovely impressionistic lines.  Obviously, I highly recommend this disc.</span>

                    <span>I just have to rank this album right alongside _Sunday at the Village Vanguard_ and _Waltz for Debby_ for top form stuff.  Unlike those two albums recorded live on a Vanguard gig, this is Bill's definitive, untouchably gorgeous, sensitive sound in the studio.<p>My god...that sound!  "Minority" is awesome to hear Evans in full orchestral mode with his trademark dense chords on the head of a wonderful, uptempo tune.   "Young and Foolish" (with the trio) and "Lucky To Be Me" (solo Bill) are the exquisite, highlight ballads, particularly the way he closes "Lucky".  "Tenderly", a waltz, is not far behind, along with "What Is There To Say?".  No one plays great music off the sentimental heartstrings better than Bill on standards;  just try to keep him from coaxing the tears and memories out of you.  He does it without a hint of sappiness, but overflowing with fresh interpretation, awareness, and sincerity.  I've said it before and I'll say it again:  that ungodly touch of his on the keys is unparalleled acoustic beauty.  There's a reason why he's revered by pianists, and even some of us guitarists. :-)<p>The first few chords of "Peace Piece" sound to my ears like the genesis of Miles' subsequently recorded "Flamenco Sketches" on _Kind of Blue_, but who cares, even if true, it doesn't detract from either.   This solo effort, like the ballads, will leave you amazed at the powers of introspection of someone quite possibly more human than the rest of us, and willing to share it.<p>This trio more than gives the _Sunday at the Village Vanguard_/_Waltz for Debby_ trio a run for its money. Sam Jones on bass doesn't take such a commanding, prominent role as Scott La Faro, but swings and drives just as mightily, working so well with Philly Joe.  As for the latter...man, let's just say Philly Joe was Bill's recognized favorite drummer for a damned good reason, namely being one of the best bop *and* cool drummers ever to walk the planet.  As much as I love Elvin, Blakey, Tony Williams, Klook, or Roach, Philly's probably got my vote, too.<p>_Night and Day_ in particular features Philly threatening to mix hard-bop raucous and Latin on his rims, dancing around Bill latching onto the nod-ya-head cool groove, while Sam takes full advantage of his featured breaks and trades with the other two.   The Sonny Rollins tune "Oleo" also makes your day, to hear this trio handle the informal jazz tradition of "rhythm changes." (For the uninitiated, "rhythm changes" refer to any tune that is more or less based off of the harmonic progression and form of Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm," though frequently reharmonized and otherwise abused :-);  Oleo in particular has a nifty, rhythmically challenging head that makes it a favorite with musicians).<p>No question, this album marked a pioneering step into the inner beyond that all jazz musicians and their audiences would love to reach.  Dig it alone, or with your significant other over a glass of equally rich wine, and you can thank me later.  :)</span>
