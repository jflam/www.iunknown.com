                <span id="Label1"><p><br><i>Understanding Virtual Reality</i> arrives at a time when the technologies behind virtual reality have advanced to the point that it is possible to develop and deploy meaningful, productive virtual reality applications. The aim of this thorough, accessible exploration is to help you take advantage of this moment, equipping you with the understanding needed to identify and prepare for ways VR can be used in your field, whatever your field may be.<br><p><br>By approaching VR as a communications medium, the authors have created a resource that will remain relevant even as the underlying technologies evolve.  You get a history of VR, along with a good look at systems currently in use. However, the focus remains squarely on the application of VR and the many issues that arise in the application design and implementation, including hardware requirements, system integration, interaction techniques, and usability.  This book also counters both exaggerated claims for VR and the view that would reduce it to entertainment, citing dozens of real-world examples from many different fields and presenting (in a series of appendices) four in-depth application case studies.<br><br>* Substantive, illuminating coverage designed for technical and business readers and well-suited to the classroom.<br>* Examines VR's constituent technologies, drawn from visualization, representation, graphics, human-computer interaction, and other fields, and explains how they are being united in cohesive VR systems.<br>* Via a companion Web site, provides additional case studies, tutorials, instructional materials, and a link to an open-source VR programming system.</span>

                    <span>Understanding Virtual Reality" is the definitive, authoritative, and exhausive exploration of the field by two insiders and practioners, Sherman and Craig.  Virtual reality, a uniquely viewer-centric, large field-of-view, dynamic display technology has evolved over the past decade in many physical formats, driven by many software applications using a variety of operating systems, computers, and specialized libraries.  Sherman and Craig capture them all in this substantial volume.<p>Most writing about virtual reality involves summarizing and interpreting interviews and demos, with massive doses of the speculative and the spectacular, and lots of historical fuzziness.  Sherman and Craig, however, lived in the world of actual VR production at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where corporate researchers, educators, scientists, and artists make use of this technology in their daily work.  They have personally suffered with VR tech and benefited greatly from access to it as well as to amazing amounts of computing, engineering, and scientific talent.  They were held to real deadlines of corporate contracts, scientific conference demonstrations, and the design of IMAX productions.  While they were doing all this, they were also writing this book.  As a result, "Understanding Virtual Reality" has the integrity and feel of a long-term, eyewitness account and a personal journal, because these production-oriented researchers were documenting the times contemporaneously, rather than trying to reconstruct the details years later.<p>I know all this because I was their group leader for a couple of years in the mid-90's at NCSA, and their colleague in VR the years before and after. I co-invented the CAVE hardware, among other things, with Dan Sandin at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in 1991.</span>

                    <span>I received this book shortly after it was published.  Since then it has served well as a reference for my students working in my VR research group, as well as being very enlightening for me as well.<br>I will be teaching a course on VR the next two spring semesters at Valparaiso University, and will be using this text.<br>The book does a great job of spanning the current VR technology out there, as well as addressing issues for development.  I'd recommend it for VR researchers, as well as those teaching VR at the undergrad or grad level.</span>
