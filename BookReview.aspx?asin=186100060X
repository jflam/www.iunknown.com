                <span id="Label1"><I>Professional DCOM Programming</I> is a dense, comprehensive tome that covers everything an experienced C++ programmer could want to know about DCOM, Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model. Author Richard Grimes covers DCOM's origins, differences from COM, and techniques for writing both DCOM clients and servers. What the book sometimes lacks in readability it makes up in thoroughness: nothing is left out, from security to multithreading, and the level of detail reached within each section is remarkable.</span>

                    <span>Micro$oft is famous for its ability to push out new development technologies. The reason behind this planned obsolesence is obvious, every time they come out with something new people will have to open their wallets to "keep up."<p>DCOM is just another disposable technology. As such, it was a complete failure; one that the marketing folks at M$ have tried to bury as quickly as possible under an avalanche of .NET hype.<p>DCOM was hard to port because, like COM, it is based on a binary standard (i.e. a standard that changes when you leave x86 and go to 64-bit RISC). Not only that, but DCOM doesn't support distributed transactions. Worst of all, DCOM is a very, very complicated technology to use. Three strikes... YOU'RE OUT!<p>The half-wit MBAs at Micro$oft realized their mistake and have abandoned DCOM, leaving it forever in the backwaters where the only record of its sorry existence are stupid books like this.<p>I have no idea why someone would want to buy this book. Folks, this is a dead technology. It is no more. It is an ex-techology. If you buy this book, you are lying to yourself. This book will sit an gather dust, unless you can find more productive uses for it...like burning it to stay warm.</span>

                    <span>It is a great book for average COM programmer who wants to fully understand details of security, marshalling and multithreading in distrubuted environment. The author concisely explains these complex topics in lucid manner. The combination of theory and code samples is optimal. The book may not be good for beginners(who don't understand COM) or very advanced COM/DCOM programmers, But it is just prfect for intermediate level COM/DCOM programmers.</span>
