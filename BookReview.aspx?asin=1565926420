                <span id="Label1">The Unix file system is reliable and very well-suited to mission-critical applications in which maximum uptime is key. But it's not flawless, and that's where <I>Unix Backup & Recovery</I> comes in. This book details dozens of strategies for keeping Unix systems online. The strategies range from good administration practices that minimize problems to hot-restore techniques that allow you to recover from breaks as seamlessly as possible. The book also contains absolutely inclusive archive techniques that allow you to restore huge databases and file systems from backup media.<p> <I>Unix Backup & Recovery</I> includes a lot of general "recommended practices" advice and lots of scary stories about lost files (and more than a few about heroic system administrators who saved the day, or at least the data). But it gets down to brass tacks too, documenting lots of backup and recovery tools that can make the administrator's job much easier when they're used properly (including cpio, tar, and AMANDA). Coverage of specific systems'  backup and recovery issues (including those of Solaris, HP-UX, Oracle, Sybase, and Informix) are invaluable, as is the coverage of techniques for extracting information from ancient, obsolete backup media. The point: read this book before you have a disaster, so you can do everything required to head one off and be ready to deal with problems when they happen. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Strategies for protecting the contents and availability of Unix systems, particularly those running Solaris, Linux, Compaq True-64 Unix, HP-UX, IRIX, and AIX. Coverage also includes backup and recovery software (free and commercial), and the mechanics of protecting and fixing large database management systems. There's also a lot of advice on defensive administration, backup hardware, and obsolete media.</span>

                    <span>Curtis Preston has put years of experience and a great deal of heart into UB&C. It's an O'Reilly, so it's got breadth and depth. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on backing up networks with the free tool, AMANDA, and on bare-metal recovery techniques for Linux. There's also a chapter on high availability system/network architecture, which I didn't anticipate from the book's title.<P>This is a fun book which I effortlessly read from cover to cover, because the author has presented backup and recovery as both a metaphor for life and as life itself. Curtis explains how to prepare for the day your wife is having a baby at the hospital across the street from the office where your 24/7 Unix network has crashed and come back up in need of data recovery! I like having a guy like that on my bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>This is *THE* Computer System backup book. It contains all the basics of why you want to backup computer systems, plus many of the real world experience details. It is written from a Unix perspective, but is still applicable to Windows and other non-Unix environments. <P>I've been using this book as a general guide for several years now. It was a book I watched work it's way through the O'Reilly system from first announcement to general release. I bought it when it first came out. I have not been disappointed in it.<P>Many people think of computer system backups as a dry old musty topic of interest to nobody in particular. But 9/11 showed how important good disaster recovery planning and procedures could be to a business. <P>Some of the specifics are now a little out of date, but not by leaps and bounds. It is still very good for its core reason for being - Backups. It is very much less out of date than other computer books on the market today.<P>I have been dealing with large-scale computer system backups and disaster recovery for large employers for years... and I still consult this book regularly to make sure have not missed anything important. It covers all the topics you need.</span>

                    <span>Even though I was still very new to Linux/UNIX, this book was able to help me create a fully automated backup routine as well as how to restore from those backups. I found the book very easy to read and not at all dry.</span>

                    <span>I had just bought this book and had thumbed through the chapters a little and read about the first two chapters. One of my systems experienced a hard crash one night and I could not get the Oracle database to come back up. Knowing basically nothing about Oracle and unable to contact the DBA or the Support people, I remembered this book had a chapter on Oracle recovery. Needless to say, it worked. If someone like myself who had never worked with Oracle before was able to use this book to easily recover a database, anyone can. The author explains about native backup utilities, databases, structures, etc on an easily understandable level. He constantly adds notes from his experiences that add enormous value to the test. Buy this Book!</span>
