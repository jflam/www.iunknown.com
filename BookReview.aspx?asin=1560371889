                    <span>I travelled the entired L&C trail 2 years ago and used an earlier edition of this book and an earlier edition of Julie Fanselow's guide book to the trail. Fifer's book has beautiful maps, but in all other ways, I felt that Fanselow's guide book was much better. The Fifer book was lacking a lot of information on sites, hotels, and campsites that the Fanselow book had. Also- my copy of the Fifer book started to fall apart after a few days on the road- the binding wasn't very secure- this makes big difference when you're referring to a book every day for several weeks! Additionally, the Fifer book had a lot of ads and the Fanselow book didn't. Some of these problems might have been corrected in the new edition, of course. I'm glad I had the Fifer book on the trail- the maps were helpful at times. But if someone is looking to purchase just one book to travel the L&C trail, Fanselow's book is definitely superior.</span>

                    <span>Now in a newly expanded and updated second edition that includes the portion of the quest east of the Mississippi River, Barbara Fifer and Vicky Soderberg's Along The Trail With Lewis And Clark is detailed travel and tourist guide to recreating the path first blazed by these justly famous 18th Century American explorers. Approved by the National Lewis & Clark Bicentennial Council, and packed with maps by Joseph Mussulman, hotel listings, and a detailed text recounting the historical journey of the famous explorers, Along The Trail With Lewis And Clark is a memorable "keepsake" book and the perfect planning guide for vacationers seeking to follow in the footsteps of this famous expedition of exploration!</span>
