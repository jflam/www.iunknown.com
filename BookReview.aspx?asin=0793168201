                    <span>I haven't tried any of his ideas yet, but the book was an excellent read. Many interesting ideas. I will be in a position to try his stratigies in about a year. I recomend studing this book if you're a future investor.

                    <span>There are so many ways to make money in real estate! Since my first flipper property, which I made $8000.00 after reading "Flipping Properties" I have pocketed 7 figures and acquired 7 units - with no prior real estate experience! Bill Bronchick illustrates and delivers, step-by-step techniques, in an user friendly manner! "Financing Secrets" will forever change the way you buy and sell real estate.</span>

                    <span>Well, Bill Bronchick has done it again.  Following his excellent resource Flipping Properties, he's taken the complex subject of creative real estate financing and broken it down into it's component parts and explained each one clearly and concisely in simple language anyone can understand.  In the section What to Expect from this Book he says, "This book will show you how to finance properties with as little cash as possible, while maintaining minimum risk and maximum profit."  And he does.<p>Covering such subjects as loans, mortgages, foreclosure, and working with lenders, he gives you the background you need for the later subjects of creative financing, hard and private money, getting involved in partnerships and equity sharing and the more creative subjects of lease options and owner financing.<p>While the book is geared primarily toward real estate investors, it is an excellent guide for any person considering buying a new home or considering doing some kind of creative financing with an investor or other buyer on a house they already own.<br>After reading it cover to cover (an easy task) every real estate investor should then add it to their library as a useful reference for many financing situations that may come up in this business.</span>

                    <span>This book had so many good finaning ideas, I read it three times!  Whether you are buying as an investor or a homeowner, this book will show you real-life formulas for buying with little or no money.  This is the first book that explains real estate financing in a way for the lay person to understand.  The author, an attorney, has a real knack for making "legal jargon" understandable.<p>I would recommend this book to ANYONE who is either buying a home or investment property.</span>
