                <span id="Label1">Extraordinary footage and eloquent narration by David Attenborough highlight the BBC's remarkable wildlife series <I>The Blue Planet: Seas of Life</I>. "Ocean World" begins with astonishing views of a gigantic blue whale--the elusive Holy Grail of undersea photography--and the marvels continue to demonstrate the power, diversity, and profound ecological influence of Earth's oceans. "Frozen Seas" examines whales, walruses, penguins, and other creatures under the extreme conditions of the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The next two episodes are even better. "Open Ocean" travels thousands of miles into the vast "liquid desert," where currents determine how the ocean's diverse life forms will assume their places in the food chain. More amazing, "The Deep" descends with a state-of-the-art submersible to the ocean's abyssal plain and beyond, filming such bizarre creatures as the fangtooth, bioluminescent jellies, transparent squid, the giant-mouthed gulper eel, and the never-before-seen hairy angler fish. <p>  "Seasonal Seas" focuses on the explosion of life that accompanies every annual blooming of plankton, numbering in the countless billions and captured here with brilliant microphotography. In "Coral Seas," miles-long reefs of living coral are explored, from deep within (requiring brief computer animation) to the surrounding environs, where you'll see white-tipped sharks in a feeding frenzy while beautiful harlequin shrimp wrestle with a starfish. "Tidal Seas" explores the myriad life forms that thrive when lunar gravity pulls the oceans offshore. "Coasts" is easily the most brutal episode, but no less mesmerizing. The most unexpected, and horrifying, sequence is the orca, earning its "killer whale" nickname by capturing, killing, and tail-tossing a seal pup--a sequence so mysteriously primal that even the most seasoned marine biologist will be utterly amazed. One of the finest wildlife programs you're ever likely to see, <I>The Blue Planet: Seas of Life</I> provides the privilege of visiting a truly alien world teeming with the rarest wonders of nature. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>There are many reasons to own this wonderful series on DVD, but one reason stands out: The Killer Whale/Seal Pup segment of the "Coasts" DVD. The Amazon.com main reviewer mentioned this scene in his review - and with good reason. It is THE most amazing piece of wildlife footage EVER captured on film - even surpassing the National Geographic special with the Great White Sharks breaching.<P>If you need more reasons than that, the "Ocean World" DVD contains unbelievable footage of Sir David in a skiff right above a Blue Whale (the largest creature ever to have lived) along with a stirring segment about an orca pod pursuing a gray whale and her calf.<P>All of my friends - who are decidely NOT nature buffs like me -were left speechless after seeing some of the segments in this set (particularly the aforementioned ones). <P>The Life of Mammals DVD set by Attenborough is also terrific.</span>

                    <span>For our family, this was the nature documentary series that got us hooked. We happened upon a Discovery Channel broadcast of one of the Blue Planet episodes, and our 2-year-old was hypnotized. For at least a year after, every time we turned on the TV, it was "I want to watch fish! FISH!!"<P>While our son likes all of the episodes, I think his favorite is "Open Ocean," which features an amazing sequence of just about every sea-dwelling predator herding and eating a school of anchovies. For the adult viewer, the narration by David Attenborough is minimalistic and informative. He really allows the cinematography to steal the show, which it does. You really do see something new every time.<P>We have watched these DVDs over and over again, and I'd probably only watch them slightly less if we didn't have kids. We've given the Blue Planet series to a few other parents as a gift, and have also since bought both The Life of Mammals and The Life of Birds via Amazon. Those two series are great as well, but not as well loved by our oldest boy as "FISH!!"</span>

                    <span>WOW!<P>I recently returned from scuba diving in Australia, Bali, and Palau as part of a larger 7 month world trip. This video set further opened my eyes to the beauty underneath and above our waters and how it all relates. I was almost entirely speechless the first few episodes - except for when I uttered frequently - (...)...or the sound of my gagging in disbelief.<P>The adrenaline dropped a little during the the 3rd and 4th CDs, but there are clips in those that made my jaw drop too! The "Deep Trouble" featurette / segment on the 4th CD is highly recommended too. I visited Tokyo, Japan - Tsukiji fish market - in Dec 2003 and saw the Bluefin Tuna auction first hand, among other sites - wow! If you never thought the world could be overfished, or don't act like it is - you must go to Tokyo and see the market first hand. It's free to go in! <P>We should take some of the next round of $50 billion used for the Iraq war and buy a copy of this and send it to every *household* in America. There would be even enough to give a free DVD player to those wihtout. Europe and Japan should do the same. There would still be money left over to send to Iraq too!</span>

                    <span>I spent a weekend completely mesmerized by this series. <P>This is an incredible journey through the oceans of the world. From the freezing poles to the warm water tropics, you meet numerous species and observe them and their habits in incredible detail. There are times when you can't tell if what you're looking at is full size or microscopic, were it not for the narrative. You learn about breeding, defense, hunting tactics, feeding, and migration. From majestic giants like whales, to the tiny plankton so many ocean species live on, there's a lot to learn, and many surprises.<P>It's an 8-part series:<BR>"Ocean World," "Frozen Seas," "Open Ocean," "The Deep," "Seasonal Seas," "Coral Seas," "Tidal Seas," and "Coasts"<BR>Each episode stands alone, concentrating most on details pertaining to its title. Where Frozen Seas concentrates more on severe weather conditions and the amazing species that can tolerate it, and how they do it, the Tidal Seas episode offers insight to the moons effect on our oceans, and the species that rely on tidal conditions to survive. In The Deep episode, you go to incredible depths, where no sunlight can penetrate and see footage of entire ecosystems that have somehow evolved and survived without the sun. Some of the species in The Deep could easily have been inspiration for many horror film monsters. <P>Clear, spectacularly vivid imagery, and an excellent narrative by David Attenborough make this series a must see.<P>I love the ocean, and being at the beach, and have always been curious and cautious about it's inhabitants. Some things I've learned here will not be forgotten. For instance, even the most likable species has to eat, which means it has to hunt and kill. All survival tactics are clever, and necessary, but some are rather cruel. And we certainly can't do more than speculate as to the reasons.<P>The more we learn about our oceans, the better able we are to respect and appreciate its riches. (and beware it's predators)!</span>
