                    <span>After reading this I started hunting for finds on ebay and the local bookstore, oh, and my mom's garage too where I found a first edition "To Kill a Mockingbird" which unfortunately turned out to be a book club editon. But it is certainly fun hunting once armed with solid information. This book is a real good place to start for someone thinking about becoming a collector, a part time dealer, or someone that is interested in obtaining a better collection through trading. I'd also recommend this book for someone that has had a family collection of books passed down, know what you have before getting rid of it at a yard sale. <BR>One more person that would benefit from this book is the reader that wants to branch out, never read sci fi or mystery? Well Ellis has an extensive list of modern authors that he recommends buying for collecting but guess what, they are collectable because they are well written, so if you want to try out something new this list is a great place to look.</span>

                    <span>I have found Ian Ellis' book quite readable and interesting. I have been selling books online for half a year or so and was looking to expand my knowledge base. I would say that Stephen Windwalker's Selling Used Books Online was more helpful for my own purposes of selling used, but not necessarily collectible ones, online. Nevertheless, I found it to be an education on how the book trade operates outside of and before the Internet. It was especially helpful to learn about modern first editions and what makes books collectible and valuable. Stylistically I found Ellis very easy to read, although he has an annoying habit of dropping the name of authors and titles that may mean more to those already initiated in the world of book collecting. I found it to be distracting. More helpful is the list of 1,001 books worth collecting in the last chapter of the book. I found the chapter addressing the advent of the Internet for bookselling to be somewhat out of date - understandable since it was revised in 2001, but I learned very little from this chapter. Overall it was a helpful book that expanded my knowledge base about the book trade, where my experience is mostly limited to online book sales.</span>

                    <span>I'm impressed with the level of honesty the author, whose life-long career is in books, used, collectible, etc etc..., shares with the reader. He's not afraid to tell secrets of the trade. He's not afraid of sharing the excitement that he evidently feels about the trade. But most importantly, he also faces describes candidly the tedious nature of making a living from book buying-trading.... It sobered me up very fast... It didn't make me want to plunge into a new hobby without the proper warnings.<BR>Additionally, I found the information regarding procuring and properly identifying a "1st edition" book highly useful in terms of its clarifying certain ambiguous and confusing terminology... WIth this information, I am prepared against book sellers who profit from ignorance. I would recommend this book to anyone before venturing to purchase their favorite author's first editions...</span>

                    <span>If one is new to collecting books of any kind, this is the book to start off with. It takes the reader on a wonderful journey of what a book actually is comprised of and the history of books in general. This book gives a great foundation while all the time the reader is learning apt and required terminology to continue the journey into actually identifying and buying good collectible books, and then how to repair and care for them, ultimately storing or selling them.</span>

                    <span>I've inherited a whole library full of antiquarian books, and I purchased BOOK FINDS through Amazon hoping to learn what to do with them. You'd think a book with the subtitle "How to Find, Buy, and Sell Used and Rare Books" would be helpful in that regard, but when Ellis says "rare" he means "first edition of modern books". There is only a hint of discussion on antiquarian books, and that is primarily to say that he's not going to discuss them. I was completely disappointed for my purposes, and had I seen the book in a brick-and-mortar shop, I would not have bought it.<P>That said, there is a fair amount of information on used and modern first edition books. Especially good is the material on what a used bookseller is going to be looking for in the material you bring him. As others have said, what is absent is information on bookselling over the internet and through companies like Amazon Marketplace. In my own experience, I've done MUCH better though Amazon Marketplace than through selling to any used bookstore. I can set my own prices, sell more merchandise (including much that a used bookstore would not take) and cut out the middleman almost entirely. (Although Amazon takes a bite, it's not nearly as big as the one taken by my local bookseller; on the minus side, going to him in person costs little in transportation and nothing in postage and handling.) Ellis would have you believe that an annotated book cannot be sold, but at Amazon Marketplace you can fully disclose the condition of the book to the buyer and still have people interested.<P>There is valuable information in the book, especially the guide to the most collectable books. This is important, as just because a book is a first edition doesn't mean there's a market for it. Demand sets the price, and where there's no demand, any claimed value is artificial. I've had a first edition that I was told was worth $100; I couldn't sell it at $15 because it was an obscure poet who no one cares much about. <P>Buyer beware, and Seller beware, too.</span>
