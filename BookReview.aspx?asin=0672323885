                    <span>... even after reading the above reviews I decided to give this book a shot. Bad idea. There are a few typos in the book that are annoying, but not really enough to lead you completely astray. Unfortunately that is about as good as the book gets. There is a complete lack of really good visual aids, diagrams, pics, and step by step "how-to's". Carla Rose also will use terminology that isn't explained until later on, making things more confusing. Additionally all the screen shots are in Mac, not Windows, which may or may not effect the examples. This book is not for the beginner. I would look else where.</span>

                    <span>This book, like many of the SAMS 24 hour series, is a good and fast introduction to the program.  If you don't have the time to wade through a thousand page tome on Photoshop this book will quickly get you up and running.  <p>My only complaint is: the download for the images used in the book only contains one picture per chapter.  Not every illustration as mentioned earlier.</span>

                    <span>Maybe the so called expert thinks this book is a 5 Star but take it from a novice, this book is absolutely terrible. Think twice before you buy.</span>

                    <span>Steps omitted, no visuals for icons and also mentioning a feature and then saying nothing else about it.  I don't care what the "so called expert" had to say, the book is bad. Try another one.</span>
