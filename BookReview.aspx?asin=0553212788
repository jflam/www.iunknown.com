                <span id="Label1">When Lorenzo de' Medici seized control of the Florentine Republic in 1512, he summarily fired the Secretary to the Second Chancery of the Signoria and set in motion a fundamental change in the way we think about politics. The person who held the aforementioned office with the tongue-twisting title was none other than Niccol&#242; Machiavelli, who, suddenly finding himself out of a job after 14 years of patriotic service, followed the career trajectory of many modern politicians into punditry. Unable to become an on-air political analyst for a television network, he only wrote a book. But what a book <I>The Prince</I> is. Its essential contribution to modern political thought lies in Machiavelli's assertion of the then revolutionary idea that theological and moral imperatives have no place in the political arena. "It must be understood," Machiavelli avers, "that a prince ... cannot observe all of those virtues for which men are reputed good, because it is often necessary to act against mercy, against faith, against humanity, against frankness, against religion, in order to preserve the state." With just a little imagination, readers can discern parallels between a 16th-century principality and a 20th-century presidency.  <I>--Tim Hogan</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In The Prince, Machiavelli advises 16th century Italian rulers to let ideals take a back seat when dealing with the sober realities of governing a state.  The author suggests that it is often necessary for the ruler to be ruthless and unjust during both war and peacetime in order to retain power.  In fact, Machiavelli asserts that it's better to gain respect by cowing the citizens into submission rather than being generous and gaining their love.
<br />
<br />I found The Prince to be very interesting and enjoyable.  Aside from the stuff dealing with what kinds of soldiers to use in war,the advice in it is still relevant today though perhaps more applicable to corporate management than to running a country.  Human rights in the modern world are generally well protected and any unwarranted cruelties and injustices would be widely publicized and the ruler chastised.  But in the competitive corporate world, putting nice and innocent employees out on the street in order to meet the bottom line is a daily occurrence.  Or when someone makes it to an executive position, he/she frequently demotes rivals.  Of course, when it comes to dealing with competitors, it's take no prisoners.  I'm not saying it's right to do these things, but that's unfortunately how the business world works.
<br />
<br />After reading this book, I wondered whether I would be capable of being Machiavelli's ideal prince.  If I had to make certain unpleasant decisions in order to safeguard the state, could I follow through on them in good conscience?  For example, if I uncover a rival's plot to assassinate me and then put him to death, Machiavelli wants me to murder the rival's entire family so that no revengeful action will be forthcoming.  I suppose that I have a difficult time relating to the way people thought about human rights four hundred years ago.
<br />
<br />More to the point, since I work in the corporate world I may one day have to make unpleasant decisions.  I think that I just might consult The Prince to help me make those decisions.  It's certainly not *the* authority on these kinds of things, but offers a sound, logical viewpoint that's worth listening to.</span>

                    <span>The Prince is a primer in how a new Prince should govern his new territory.  It is seen as having frequent parallels in the business world.  
<br />
<br />Any book that has been in print continuously for 500 years has to have something going for it. The Prince is a set of rules that Machiavelli would have the Prince follow. They have entered our culture as a set of sayings such as "it is better to be loved & feared, it is better to be feared then loved, it is dangerous to be held in contempt or hatred." 
<br />
<br />By today's standards his recommendations are pretty brutal, Saddam Hussein would have found them to be exactly what he followed. Our elected princes (or our princes in business) in the US can't be quite this rough. Perhaps if we use the word fire rather than kill when a new president comes into the Government or the Corporation. 
<br />
<br />Machiavelli was a better writer and observer than he was a practicioner. He wrote the book while in prison for picking the wrong prince to back.</span>

                    <span>The Prince is what Niccolo Machiavelli believes what a prince should act like.  It is basically a template for how you should rule your kingdom.  He has several pieces of funny yet good advice.   Such as, if the noble should cause you trouble, strip him of all of his land and title and ship him out of your country.  He talks about the characteristics a good prince would have.  A prince must be merciful, yet cruel.  This way he is viewed as a merciful yet stern prince.  If you were to rule a monarcy and you wanted to hold on to it, the best way to do this is to follow the template in the prince.  </span>
