                    <span>I think it is a better book than 2 edition, the authors have included the latest important stuff removing the arcane concepts like how adder work, addressing mode etc. I really enjoyed reading this book, appendix chapters really help me to brush up my basic concepts. However this book doesn't completely explains the concept of benchmarking machines -- what useful information can be drawn out of those tables.</span>

                    <span>Nearly every CS or ECE department is US uses this as their textbook, because the authors are the most experienced researcher in this field. The book has plenty of descriptions but it lacks examples and explanations. What's more, you can never understand accurately what the authors mean in the exercises. They just assume that you know everything about the background knowledge. This semester we spent most of the time to clarify the doubts about the exercises in this course. So I suggest to use another book if you can.</span>

                    <span>I have to say that this is the worst textbook I have ever used.  It makes no sense!  I would work on assigned problems from the book and I would spend more time trying to figure out what the question was asking for than I did actually working on the problem.  And the text is no help when you are trying to figure out what to do as there are few if any examples.  Frequently when trying to read their explanations of things I would find myself wondering what the heck they were talking about.  I would not recommend this book for anyone who dislikes being confused and frustrated.</span>

                    <span>While this is a comprehensive book for some one trying to understand the design philosophies in Comp. Architecture I notice the following problems <br>* A lot of simple concepts are explained in a complex cryptic manner. May be the authors try to pour in all their academic experience on the subject in to each paragraph.<br>* A lot of errors in examples..( atleast in the old edition)</span>
