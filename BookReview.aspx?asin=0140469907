                <span id="Label1">"Competitive running gives your running life a focus. Competition measures progress. You set a goal and accomplish it." Bob Glover and Shelly-lynn Florence Glover, authors of <I>The Competitive Runner's Handbook</I>, know what they're talking about. Bob has run competitively for nearly 40 years, coached for 30 years, and completed more than 30 marathons, while Shelly-lynn has raced for more than 20 years and is an exercise physiologist with a master's degree from Columbia University. They've coauthored several books on running. Clocking in at over 600 pages, <I>The Handbook</I> covers basic training techniques, gives tips on speed training, and outlines regimens for specific races: short, 5K, 10K, half-marathon, and marathon. There are also sections on motivation and the mental aspects of competitive running, proper running form, nutrition, dealing with illness and injury, and more. In addition, the book includes many helpful charts. Straightforward and authoritative, this is a comprehensive reference guide that's suited to runners of all levels. <I>--Andy Boynton</I></span>

                    <span>This is my least favorite running book although it is written competently enough.  Too much childish ego on the part of the authors detracts from an otherwise good enough book.  The best part of the book for me was the discussion of heart rate training, something that is barely mentioned in many of the other running books.  There is also not enough explanation on developing training schedules which wasn't too much of a surprise since the authors sell guess what?... training schedules and coaching.  Worth buying but not the best.</span>

                    <span>This book starts off by breaking runners into categories from Novice to Elite. There are 7 categories (further broken down by age groups and gender), and any recent race time (from 5k all the way to marathon) can be used to help you find out where you fit. Glover explains the different training concepts to help you improve your times. He goes into a lot of detail about all of the important topics. He gives weekly mileage guidelines, talks about maintaining a running base (what % of your weekly mileage should be used as a base), and what paces you should be training at based on your desired race time. Although his advice is specific (and supported with examples of studies that have been done to prove how certain concepts work), all of his advice can be adjusted to fit the individual reader's level and goals. He gives examples of training schedules for the 5k up to the marathon for each category of runner, and tells you how to write your own schedule. He gives many examples of different types of speedwork, hill training, and tempo training so runners can add variety to their own schedules. He says how often each workout should be done on a weekly basis, and at what point they should be done in the training cycle. This is a great book, easy to read, and full of tips that can help you improve your time at any distance. <br>I used to do my daily runs at the same pace, and train without a plan. Last year I started training using the concepts explained in this book (speedwork, hills, long run distances), and I have been able to cut 13 minutes off of my half marathon time in less than 8 months. These training concepts are well known, but Glover customizes them to the reader's level, gives many different examples of each type of workout, and expains which workouts are best for the distance you are training for (For example, he says 1 mile intervals are better when training for the 10k up to the marathon, while power intervals and repeats will be more helpful when training for a 5k or shorter distance). This is a great book, and I wish I had read it sooner.</span>

                    <span>This book covers everything with regards to training,<br>equipment, nutrition, and crosstraining for everything<br>from running the 5K race to the marathon. The language<br>is very simple to understand, and provides useful <br>charts with regards to times in age-class groups, and<br>how they would rank in a field of runners, from your<br>back of the pack runners to your elite runner. It also<br>accounts for clothing, warming up, cooling down,<br>and everything imaginable related to running. If you<br>don't have a coach, or can't afford one, this is <br>probably your best alternative in terms of learning<br>how to train effectively and properly. Bob and<br>Shelley-Lynn really know what they are talking about,<br>and even the seasoned veterans might find it useful.<br>I have been running off and on since 1983, but I <br>didn't have any real ideas of how to train and eat<br>right until I read this book with regards to <br>competitive running. This book is highly recommended<br>if you intend to race competively in the 5K, 10K,<br>1/2 marathon and/or marathon. This should be your<br>Running Bible. If you haven't ran in a while, I<br>suggest consult your family physician before you<br>begin training, especially if you're really out<br>of shape, overweight, and a smoker or drinker.<br>It's probably best to use it as a reference guide<br>if you don't have the time to read through all<br>the book at once.<p>This book is<br>broken down into sections and chapters as follows:<p>Introduction: Challenge of Competitive Running<br>PART I: Basic Training<br> 1.

                    <span>This is the best and most complete book on running since Jim Fixx's mammothly successful book 25 years ago. What I like best about the Glover's book is that it has something in it for every runner, from the casual jogger to an elite marathoner. Each chapter focuses on a special area of the sport: injuries, mileage, women's running, seniors, masters runners, even children developing into competitive athletes.<p>The title is instructive: there is an emphasis on competitive running, with the focus primarily in 10K road races to the marathon. Several of the elite and most popular marathons are discussed at length, incuding Boston, L.A., New York and Chicago. There are some useful tips on how to increase your weekly mileage, avoid injury, carbo loading before the race and recovery afterwards. Having completed marathons, I can tell you that it's easy to do than you think and once you start completing the 26.2 mile courses, you'll be hooked for as long as your body will hold out.<p>Running is a joyous activity and one which brings many individual rewards. If you're a serious, addicted runner, you'll love this book, but the beginners will also reap great rewards. It's well-written, fun to read and instructive. Highly recommended.</span>
