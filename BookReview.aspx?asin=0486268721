                    <span>Whatever else one may feel about President Lincoln (he has been both glorified as a martyr and demonized as an opponent of individual civil liberties), one cannot come away from this great little anthology of his speeches without seeing a principle-driven politician at his best. And the principle that we see driving Lincoln from his very earliest days through his final speeches (although by that time, preserving the Union had become an equally important theme) is that of the abolition of slavery.
<br />
<br />Lincoln is clearly a man who believed in right and wrong. He sees slavery as the great evil of his day. From the beginning of his political involvement to the day he died, his speeches show him as a man determined to do away with this evil.
<br />
<br />If only we had one man in our political arena as interested in principles today. We have'nt had one in our Federal Government since Paul Wellstone died. Too many are money and/or power driven rather than having any interest in principle.
<br />
<br />I do not say this to despair.
<br />
<br />I picked up my copy of this book this spring at the gift shop of the National Historic site for Lincoln's birthplace. Both the site (which is beautiful and well worth seeing if you're ever in Kentucky) and the book stand as testimonies to what one determined man of principles can do.
<br />
<br />Read these speeches if you get a chance.
<br />
<br />I recommend them highly.</span>

                    <span>I find it amazing to read these speeches, considering that I've heard some of them a few times (performed by actors). They come across just as powerully written as they do orally.<p>What's even more amazing is that Lincoln worked hard to educate himself, and his writing reflects someone who is in love with the usage and power of words, language, and meaning.<p>His style is somewhat outdated (punctuation usage has changed, and the odd capitalization of nouns is a holdover from possibly the Germanic influence on English) but never stilted or boring.<p>And, the Gettysburg Address is still eloquent (and powerful) after all of this time.</span>

                    <span>This book is a well thought-out collection of a dozen Lincoln speeches.  I liked this book because of the variety.  The speeches range from short (like the Gettysburg address) to very long inaugural addresses and speeches to Congress (20+ pages).  Most speeches are from Lincoln's presidency, but the book also includes speeches from earlier in his political career.  The speeches are in chronological order.  In my opinion, Lincoln's early speeches were long winded and not particularly good, but I'm glad they were included, because it is fascinating to see how his style evolved, and how he really didn't become a great speaker (in my opinion) until after he became President.<p>My only complaint has nothing to do with the book itself.  It's that Amazon is now charging a $1.99 "sourcing fee", thereby raising the book's price from $1.50 to $3.49.  Amazon, I wish you would do away with these fees!</span>

                    <span>I am hesitant to say much of anything about a historic figure as iconic as Abraham Lincoln, simply because I feel that there is very little to say that hasn't been said, and said better, already. Two brief points, then:<p>1) In addition to being one of our greatest presidents, Lincoln was also one of our greatest WRITERS. Certainly as a rhetorician he has had few peers - Dr. King is the only American who springs to mind.<p>2) If you're think about buying this, JUST DO IT. Jeez - it's only a buck fifty. What have you got to lose?<p>PS Here's a great big "THANK YOU" to Dover Publications for making this and other fine books available at such an economical price. I don't know how you guys do it, but please, DON'T STOP!</span>

                    <span>This book presents the full-length versions of some of Lincoln's best oratory feats.  Great Speeches contains fifteen of Lincoln's best along with his famous letter to Mrs. Bixby, who lost all five of her sons during the war.  Here is an excerpt as only Lincoln could create: <br>"I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom."<p>What you get from the book is a fabulous primary source from which to quote our sixteenth president.  What you do not get is a lot of analysis on his underlying motivations.  Although a short essay at the beginning of each discourse helps place Lincoln's words in historical context, you will not find a wealth of scholarly insight into why Lincoln gave each particular speech and what the implications were to the nation.  Nevertheless, Great Speeches helps the reader understand this incredible man in a manner unbiased by the opinions of others.<p>Highly recommended for anyone wishing to learn more about President Lincoln and some of the issues he faced during a time of incredible national upheaval.</span>
