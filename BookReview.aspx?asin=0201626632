                    <span>I hesitated to buy this book because it's relatively expensive for its small size.  But after reading it (in less than three hours), I realized it's one of the most important books I had ever read!  Feibelman gives very helpful advices for not only grad students, but also postdocs and junior faculty members.  These are advices that grad schools or even thesis mentors won't give you.  Some are obvious suggestions, but many others were totally new to me.  Among many other things, this book:
<br />
<br />1) helps you choose a thesis/postdoc lab;
<br />2) helps you decide whether to go into industry or academia;
<br />3) explains to you why it's not a good idea to start your career as an assistant professor;
<br />4) tells you when is the best time to publish your data;
<br />5) teaches you how to write good papers and to prepare for talks;
<br />6) gives you guidelines for grant writing;
<br />7) etc. etc.
<br />
<br />However, it seems to me that a few suggestions may not be applicable to biologists -- Feibelman is a physicist and thus may not be very familiar with other disciplines.  Also, he seems to have overlooked the importance of networking with other scientists, for example at conferences.</span>

                    <span>Most of the pages in this brief book are devoted to statements of the obvious that anyone worthy of a Ph.D. should be able to discern on his or her own. There are some useful points on presentations and communication. The author points out the excessive burdens of being an assistant professor and suggests that the candidate establish a reputation in industry or government, then seek a (presumably tenured) academic post. Though I agree that one should avoid being an assistant professor at all costs, I cannot think of a single professor in my discipline (Organic Chemistry) who has obtained a tenured position without moving up through the assistant professor rank.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book for absolutely anyone working on his/her PhD or looking for career advice at the end of their PhD. In fact, it will be a great help even to those who are long finished with their PhD's especially if they are currently advising their own students. <br>The writing style is very friendly and straightforward, as if the author is talking to you, sitting across from you. More importantly, the advise is very practical and comes from someone who has a lot of experience in academia.</span>

                    <span>You'll find a lot of valuable advice in this book even if you think you already know all these things.  I was at first skeptical that something new for me would emerge from this tiny book (especially after having attended many seminars on topics discussed in the book), yet in many cases I felt that what I read did strengthen my understanding of the processes and tradeoffs involved in selecting an advisor/mentor, making a career choice (industry vs. academia), writing a grant proposal, etc.<br>If you are on the verge of such an important step in your professional life and decide to save yourself the $10 or so that the book costs, you are truly shortchanging yourself.<br>If nothing else, read the book at the library -- it would take you 2-3 hours, but the results will be a lifetime's worth!</span>
