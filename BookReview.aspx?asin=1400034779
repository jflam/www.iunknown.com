                <span id="Label1">This first novel in Alexander McCall Smith&#8217;s widely acclaimed The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series tells the story of the delightfully cunning and enormously engaging Precious Ramotswe, who is drawn to her profession to &#8220;help people with problems in their lives.&#8221;  Immediately upon setting up shop in a small storefront in Gaborone, she is hired to track down a missing husband, uncover a con man, and follow a wayward daughter.  But the case that tugs at her heart, and lands her in danger, is a missing eleven-year-old boy, who may have been snatched by witchdoctors.<br><br><b>The No. 1 Ladies&#8217; Detective Agency</b> received two Booker Judges&#8217; Special Recommendations and was voted one of the International Books of the Year and the Millennium by the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>.</span>

                    <span>This book was a light read but an enjoyable one. The story is of Precious Ramotswe, a "traditional" African woman in size but "untraditional" in her ambitions. She opens Botswana's first ladies detective agency. Her character is strong, has high morals and when it comes to the truth she is refreshingly blunt. Her frankness and matter of factness had me laughing out loud sometimes. The book is set up in a way where the first part describes her father's life, her life, and a bit of history on Africa. The rest of the book is set up in a format where it's short chapters on her cases. These aren't suspenseful cases with twists and turns like you would find in a mystery novel, but they are more simple and quickly resolved. This isn't a book were the plot thickens and evolves. It remains pretty constant in its plot, speed, and energy level. I suggest sitting down in the bookstore and reading the first 20 pages. If you enjoy it then you'll enjoy the rest of the book. If you don't enjoy it then don't read it as it doesn't change much throughout the rest of the book. This was a different read than I normally choose but I still enjoyed it. Its perfect summer reading! I will definitely be reading the rest of the series.</span>

                    <span>Hardcore mystery fans who live for tightly plotted constructions sporting unexpected solutions may be disappointed in THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY--but what this episodic work lacks in such staple elements of the mystery genre it more than makes up for with character and setting and style. The novel presents us with the episodic adventures of Mma Ramotswe, a large lady of Botswana brimming with commonsense and self-confidence who--with a little reliance on both Agatha Christie and a mail-order "how to" book--converts her beloved father's legacy into a detective agency and quickly makes a name for herself as one of the most astute investigators in the region.<P>Written in a simple style that evokes African fable, the book is episodic in construction, offering several different tales from Mma Ramotswe's casebook--tales that emphasize the culture in which she moves and the thoughtways of her fellow citizens with remarkable elegance. Whether it is tracing a missing husband, investigating a fraudulent insurance claim, or coping with a loathsome witchdoctor, Mma Ramotswe is clever, practical, and remarkably human, and the book has a gentle irony-laced humor that is almost certain to please.<P>The character is easily one of the most memorable created for the mystery genre in a great many years and her presentation is nothing short of completely enjoyable; most readers will feel they'd like to fly to drop in for some of her bush tea and commonsense advice. This is certainly a one-sitting read, the sort of book that you pick up intending to read only a chapter or two and then glance up to find that you've missed your dinner date. Absolutely charming, strongly recommended, and I'm looking forward to reading more of Mme Ramotswe's adventures in the future!<P>GFT, Amazon Reviewer</span>

                    <span>After the death of her father Precious Ramotswe uses the inheritance to buy herself a house and an office from which she starts the first detective agency in Botswana. Business starts slowly, but she gets a number of clients with problems ranging from missing husbands to fraudulent employees and she starts to build up a reputation leading to new clients. The book describes some of the cases that Mma Ramotswe solves, but the real star of the book is Africa: there are long, loving descriptions of the nature, the people, the culture and the life in Africa and anybody who has been to Africa (and subsequently loves the continent despite all its problems) can use this book to refresh their memories and long back to those real African nights. Don't read this as a detective but as a book about Africa.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to read this book because of the positive reviews it had received. The book was hard for me to get into. I wanted the mystery to present itself sooner than it did. Too much time was spent on the main character's history, which I suppose was to set up the series. When she finally got a case, it was resolved very quickly. I realized that this book would describe several simple, quick cases she had worked on rather than having a main mystery that would serve as a plot. It was interesting to have Africa as a backdrop, but that is not enough to make me want to read other books in this series, the first book of which disappointed me.</span>
