                <span id="Label1"><p>Everybody has the dream: Build a boat in the backyard and sail off to join the happy campers off Pogo Pogo, right? But how? Assuming you aren't independently wealthy, if you want a boat that's really you, you gotta build it yourself. <p>Backyard boatbuilding has its problems. Building in fiberglass is itchy, smelly, and yields a product that yachting maven L. Francis Herreshoff once called "frozen snot." Ferrocement, once all the rage, has pretty much sunk from favor, if you catch the drift. But there's still wood, right? Ah, wood. Nature's perfect material. You can build in the time-honored traditions of the Golden Age of Yachting, loving crafting intricate joints in rare tropical hardwoods, steaming swamp oak butts to sinuous shapes, holding the whole thing together with nonferrous fastenings that cost a buck or better each. Does that sound like boatbuilding for everyperson? <p>What about the currently fashionable wood/epoxy boatbuilding? You butter regular old wood with Miracle Whip, stick it together in the shape of a boat, and off you go, right? Epoxy works, but They don't exactly give it away; nor is it exactly a benign substance. Suiting up like Homer Simpson heading for a fun-filled day at the nuclear power plant isn't exactly the aesthetic boatbuilding experience many of us are looking for. <p>Where does that leave us? In the capable hands of George Buehler, who honors the timeless traditions of the sea all right, but those from the other side of the boatyard tracks. Buehler draws his inspiration from centuries of workboat construction, where semiskilled fishermen built rugged, economical boats from everyday materials in their own backyards, and went to sea in them in all kinds of weather, not just when it was pleasant. <p>Buehler's boats sail on every ocean and perform every task, from long-term liveaboards in Norwegian fjords to a traveling doctor's office in Alaska. This book contains complete plans for seven cruising boats--from a 28-foot sailboat to a 55-foot power cruiser. All the information you need is here, including step-by-step instructions honed by nearly 20 years of supplying boat plans to backyard builders--and helping them out when they get into trouble. <p>Buehler is anarchic, heretical, and occasionally profane; his book is West Coast counterculture meets traditional hardchine workboat construction, leavened with hardnosed common sense and penny-pinching economy. This book is for those who look around them and see that much of what is done in the world today--whether in yachting or politics or economics or interpersonal relationships--is based not on logic but on conforming and meeting other people's expectations. This book is most definitely NOT about either. It is about the realization of dreams. <p>If you believe that everyone who wants a cruising boat can have one . . .  <p>If you see beauty beneath the fish scales and work scars of a commercial fishing boat . . .  <p>If you want to build a simple, rugged, economical, good-looking cruising boat--power or sail--using everyday lumberyard materials and few skills other than perseverance, this is the book for you. <i>Buehler's Backyard Boatbuilding</i> tells you how to build extraordinary boats using the most ordinary skills and materials, with complete plans, instructions, and specifications for seven real cruising boats ranging from a 28-foot sailboat to a 55-foot power cruiser. <p>"Build wooden boats the Buehler way, which is to say inexpensively, yet like the proverbial brick outhouse."--<i>WoodenBoat</i> <p>Richly flavored with personal advice and anecdotes as well as a wealth of valuable information."--American Sailing Association <p>"Everyone will revere this book."--<i>The Ensign</i></span>

                    <span>As a wooden boatbuilding teacher, I must recomend reading materials to my students, some of which do not read all that well. Mr. Buehler writes a manuel on the construction of wooden cruising boats, which, Although written in a lighthearted, easy to read style, tells all the details needed to build a boat. He is a man who has done it and continues to do it, and I would imagine will always do it. It, being building wooden boats. He, like many of us "neither worships nor derives sexual pleasure from wooen boats", but will always love them nonetheless. I recomend this book to anyone even mildly interested in building a boat of any material.</span>

                    <span>For those of you who are tiard of having someone tell you how to spend your money when it comes to boating. For those of you who are tiard of look alike boats with no personality then this is a book for you. For those of you who dream of owning a real blue water cruising sailboat, this is a must have book. This book is a no nonsense, down to earth, how to manual for building a wooden sailboat. This book is biased towards hard chimed sailboats that are easier to build than round hulls so the builder has a better chance of completing their project. Everything in this book is simplified. Do not take this to mean that the boats described in this book are unsafe, they are probably the safest boats on the water, but that the building and maintenance of these boats are a first consideration in the design.The book starts off with a description of different types of hulls along with different building materials. It then moves on to the different materials you will need and then a "this is step one" aproach to building a sailboat from the keel up. All steps from casting a keel to framing up, to planking, to building an interior, installing the hardware and standing up the rig are covered in detailed instructions with just the right amount of humor and story tossed in to keep you hooked. All the while it is assumed you are an everyday joe and not some millionair with money to burn doing the work.To top it off, included in the back of the book are plans for several sailboats that are complete and ready to build from. What more could you ask. The plans themselves are worth the cost of the book!Did I like this book, you better believe I did. You should pick up a copy and read it with an open mind, you might start thinking about boating with a different attitude towards what "must be done" to be on the water.</span>

                    <span>George Buehler builds boats based on northwest workboats. This book is not about building with fiberglass or steel or aluminum, it's about building with wood. A workboat from the northwest has two qualities that animate all of Buehler techniques and designs: they are made out of wood and, being from a part of the country where there are many forests, use lots of it and they are simple. <BR>The designs presented in the book and most of the techniques are all based on chine-designed hulls. There is not much here about building carvel planked, round bottomed boats, nor anything about multi-chine designs, only hard chine very heavy craft that will be very tough for a very long time. Performance is not in the author's vocabulary.<BR>This approach allows the author to use less than optimum quality materials and, accordingly, save a great deal of money. However, if you happen to reside in a part of the country where wood is less plentiful, you are going to have a hard time following the design principles that Buehler lays out and you are not going to recognize the same savings. Also, this book was published in 1991. A great deal has happened to the availability of timber since then.<BR>What Buehler is very good at is debunking the myth that you need to spend top dollar on things that the industry says you have to have (e.g. galvanized stays work just as well as stainless steel stays for about a third of the cost). His emphasis is getting the builder safely into the water and there is a lot to be said for that. It's unfortunate though, that an acceptance of more modern and lighter weight building techniques that achieve the same level of safety could not be more explored. But then, that would be a different book. <BR>Read it for his sense of debunking the modern sailing myths and to help you think out of the box. But if you are building in metals, strip or cold molding, or fiberglass, or anything which would be considered other than heavy displacement, this book will not help you much.</span>

                    <span>Some hobbies can grow into overwhelmingly large projects. After a while, it could become drudgery and you start to wonder why you started doing something like this. Building or renovating a boat is one such project. Look in the classifieds of boating magazines and count the "partially renovated" boats. Or listen to the endless stories of failed attempts and dollars poured into large structures that never saw the water. <P>If you are lucky, you have found this book before you have started building your boat. If you are not, this book will still give you some perspective on why you are working on that huge contraption in your garage every weekend. This book tells you what can be done, what costs can be cut and what you can shoot for when you do not need to impress well-heeled shoppers at a boat show or build a boat that will look good on the cover of "Yachting World" with a bikini-clad beauty at the helm. You cannot and should not shoot for the cover of "Yachting World" when you are building your own boat. This book will tell you what you should do. And how to do it. <P>This book is best read alongside the catalogue of George Buehler's designs. His simple, yet practical boats are not the stuff for glossy magazines, but will no doubt offer just as much sailing pleasure - and safety - for less money. That, according to Buehler, is the advantage of building your own boat. You can cut the costs that go into making the boat "marketable" and concentrate your expenditures on the beef. <P>Even when you are not building to one of Buehler's designs, you will learn what NOT to do when you boatbuilding project begins to seem like a daunting task. If you are not building to one of his designs, you should own other books on boatbuilding as well. This book is not comprehensive if you are planning on building boats that are not built by his method. <P>Also, the rustic, rugged philosophy behind his designs is a refreshing departure from modern sailing magazines written for leveraged buyout kings. It will remind you why you are dealing with those heavy chunks of lumber in the first place. You are doing it to have fun.</span>

                    <span>I have had this book for over a year. I have read it several times and pick it up quite often just to dream and laugh. He is really funny and right to the point. I have lots of other boatbuilding books, but this is certainly my favorite. I only like power boats, so that's my view point. <P>If you want to build a boat-- this is really the only book you need. It covers everything and has plans for quite a few boats you can build. I think the 34 ft Alaska is great project. I already own a 35' wood power boat, but it is not constructed half way as sturdy as George's designs. He definetly uses really really heavy frames, which is a good thing! His views on Chine vs Round hulls are right on. His lofting chapter makes it so easy, and he's right, it is. The whole book is really an inspiration! He lets YOU know that YOU can do it. Kudos to George, I really think he has enabled people to achieve their dreams of cruising. <P>He will save you a bunch of money too. Avoid Marine products unless you really need too use them.<P>What else can I say. It's worth every penny.<P>His Troller Book is great too, but this is the best. <P>Check out his webpage and his diesel duck boats.<P>George rules!</span>
