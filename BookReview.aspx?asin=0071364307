                    <span>If this book were an entr√©e, it would mostly consist of meat and potatoes. Author Marlene Caroselli accompanies her valuable handbook on the basics of leadership with insightful quotations and anecdotes. "Basic" is the operative word here. The book makes no pretense, for example, of delving into the theoretical side of leadership development. Nor does it prepare managers for specific business tasks that they're more likely to encounter as leaders, such as budgeting and strategic planning. Rather, this book is specifically tailored for current managers who have leadership ambitions, and for newly minted leaders who need a little expertise to seize control of their new roles. We recommend it as a solid menu option with lots of good advice for that eager-to-lead audience. The book is thoroughly crafted to achieve its purpose, though more experienced readers may find themselves asking, "Where's the gravy?"</span>

                    <span>Leadership Skills for Managers(published by McGraw-Hill) provides some unusual slants on the topic of leadership.  For example, the assertion that "leaders form strategic alliances" was something I hadn't considered before.  The Prism of Partnerships showed exactly how to form such alliances.  Thank you for some new slants on an old subject.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Marlene Caroselli has done it again!  Each chapter is full of excellent tips for today's manager.  My favorite, though, concerned the leader as communicator..the line that said when Cicero spoke, men marveled, but when Caesar spoke, men marched.  Getting "your men to march" to be successful in achieving your management goals is imperative to a good manager...it gave me some serious and thoughtful ideas to get my "staff to march."  A real must for a successful manager...Thank you Dr. Caroselli!</span>

                    <span>Leadership Skills for Managers is filled with valuable tips, revealing self-assessments, and probing questions. And, every chapter ends with a checklist that I found very useful. Best of all, though, were the inserts scattered throughout the chapters. "Henry's Hubris," for example, was an example of Smart Managing: it showed that when corporate spies went skulking around, trying to catch managers making decisions, productivity declined, as did morale. These short, interesting inclusions alone were worth the price of the book.</span>
