                    <span>	This book is very different in style and tone from the other `Toletec Wisdom' books. It is written by someone other than don Miguel, and has a different form. Instead of a series of succinct, simple stories told in the first person, it is a flow of information in many forms that is more `out there' and enigmatic. The destruction of Atlantis, a new definition of `hell', the `Allies' who are actual beings that feed on our fear - these and more lend a Castaneda-like feel to this book. It is an interesting book to read when you are in a relaxed, free-form, jazzy kind of mood, ready to curl up on the sofa and drift from idea to idea. This kind of mood is necessary, because the book lacks a clear-cut form. The same kind of mood you would want to be in to read Zecharia Stichin, or David Icke. For more clear-cut, less impressionistic reading on the same basic subjects - spirits, the journey inward, journeying, ethics, etc - try the other Toltec books, Energetic Anatomy by Mark Rich, or even the books of Sylvia Brown, a well-known psychic. All have something to offer people on this path. </span>

                    <span>Go and get a book called "tales from the time loop" by David Icke!  It covers all this and much more!  One of the best books to come around in decades...</span>

                    <span>I found this book to wander around in circles.  Your best bet would be go right to the source - read "The Four Agreements" by Don Miguel Ruiz himself, and you will find the simplicity of his readings more beneficial - it's direct and intertwined with relations of the agreements with all aspects of life - home, friends, work - it's a wonderful philosophy, so to speak.  Then read any of his other books and you will be pleasantly enlightened.</span>

                    <span>One of the main principles is learning to free yourself from fear. Becoming a better person through freedom and joy, controlling yourself from allies. If you read this book you would understand it is a wonderful book with loads of wisdom and knowledge. Many people have already mis-judged. First of all the book is not written by Miguel Ruiz it is written by Mary Carroll Nelson. It is based upon Don Miguel's teachings.</span>

                    <span>Being an avid Casteneda fan, I have to say I was disappointed with this book.  I could barely bring myself to finish it.  The author combines Christian and Buddist teachings with a white washed version of the Toltecs.  For example, the book describes some of the ancient Toltec ruins as pure places of love.  Perhaps Ruiz forgets that human sacrafice was practiced on some of those very same ruins?<p>I put this book down and reread Casteneda's works and Regan's Evolution of a Warrior.  Far better in my opinion.</span>
