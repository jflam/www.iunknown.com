                <span id="Label1">In Isak Dinesen's universe, the magical enchantment of the fairy tale and the moral resonance of myth coexist with an unflinching grasp of the most obscure human strengths and weaknesses. A despairing author abandons his wife, but in the course of a long night's wandering, he learns love's true value and returns to her, only to find her a different woman than the one he left. A landowner, seeking to prove a principle, inadvertently exposes the ferocity of mother love. A wealthy young traveler melts the hauteur of a lovely woman by masquerading as her aged and loyal servant. <br><br>Shimmering and haunting, Dinesen's <b>Winter's Tales</b> transport us, through their author's deft guidance of our desire to imagine, to the mysterious place where all stories are born.<P></span>

                    <span>This is a terrifc book by a unique writer.<P>That's no surprise, because Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen) wrote a<BR>number of fine books. Her ledger contains a couple of books of<BR>reminiscence about her life in Africa, a pseudonymous novel<BR>(_The Angelic Avengers_), and posthumously published books of<BR>stories (_Carnival_) and essays (_Daguerrotypes_). Despite the<BR>interest and occasional excellence of these books -- especially<BR>in the case of _Out of Africa_ -- it's as a writer of long<BR>stories that she exhibited her greatest artistry and<BR>achievement.<P>She published 4 collections of short stories in her lifetime:<BR>_Seven Gothic Tales_, _Winter's Tales_, _Anecdotes of Destiny_,<BR>and _Last Tales_. She also published a slim novel (really a<BR>novella), _Ehrengard_. As a devoted reader, I've enjoyed every<BR>one of these books. Still, it does her no disservice to point<BR>out that some are better than others. Her first book, _Seven<BR>Gothic Tales_ is usually the book of stories that people<P>remember first-- deservedly, because any book that contains<BR>"The Deluge at Norderney," "The Monkey," and "The Poet" gets<BR>high marks. The other stories in the book aren't exactly<BR>chopped liver, either.<P>However, I will submit that _Winter's Tales_ deserves to be<BR>mentioned in the same breath as _Seven Gothic Tales_. Indeed,<BR>in some ways, it surpasses the earlier book as a work of art.<BR>The level of writing is uniformly high; the style is still<BR>ornate and surprising, but better controlled. There is some<BR>excellent work here. Two stories that I particularly liked were<BR>"Alkmene" and "The Fish." But what puts this book over the top<BR>is that it contains "Sorrow Acre," arguably the best example of<BR>Blixen's fiction. In fact, one could argue that "Sorrow Acre"<BR>is one of the finest stories written in the 20th century by<BR>*anyone*. It's a marvel of subtle irony. By itself, it was<BR>worth the price of admission.<P>Her two later collections, _Anecdotes of Destiny_ and _Last<BR>Tales_ have their moments. In particular, several stories from<BR>_Anecdotes..._ have grown on me over the years, such as<BR>"Babette's Feast" and "Tempests." Still, to my mind, she hit<BR>her high water mark in _Seven Gothic Tales_ and _Winter's<BR>Tales_.</span>

                    <span>Isak Diensen's book of ornate, Baroque prose is on an unreachable echelon separate from any writer writing literature today or even from her era. Her stories transport readers to a period where thinking and intelligence were elegant and refined, smooth and intermixed with tints of religiosity. Stories such as "The Invincible Slave-Owner" and "The Sailor-Boy's Tale" show Diensen's strong knowledge of Danish folklore and Baroque description. Mind you, this is not easy reading! The messages are simple, but yet they are dense, and it is very easy to overlook these simple truths as a result of that flamboyance and extravagant complexity for which she has become internationally recognized. Her themes are like those of any writer: strength, courage during adversity, love, etc... But it is how these themes are conveyed that make these tales remarkable. Isak Diensen a.k.a. Baroness Karen Blixen's childhood was not one of the best, and these tales seem to indicate that. They transport the reader, take him or her away to places that seem unreachable, but her life does not mitigate the beautiful intelligence and language that she is able to convey. Diensen was twice nominated for the Noble Prize in Literature, losing to Ernest Hemmingway and Albert Camus. For more on her life and stories, read Judith Thurman's Life of a Storyteller: The Biography of Isak Diensen.</span>

                    <span>I am a long time fan of Isak Dinesen's short stories. They are little jewels of rich, sometimes ornate, always beautiful and strange prose. Winter's Tales holds together from beginning to end especially well, and includes my favorite tale of all, "Alkmene." Isak Dinesen's stories are like fairy tales remembered in a dream (or is it dreams remembered in a fairy tale?). They resonate with deep longing and sadness as well as an appreciation for the jokester in the universe.</span>

I sat next to a Russian Foreign Exchange student & he had no friends in the US so I gave him my best friend "Winter's Tales". A great colections of tales as told around the fires during the darkness of winter.</span>
