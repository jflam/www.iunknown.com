                    <span>"Guerrilla Advertising" is good in its own right, but is somewhat dissappointing when compared with the Author's "Guerrilla Marketing Weapons" book (which costs slightly less than "Guerrilla Advertising"). Based upon the reputation of the Guerrilla series of books, I ordered four of the books covering Advertising, Marketing and Public Relations. However, I soon found that "Guerrilla Marketing Weapons" was Levinson's greatist-hits volume. As good as the other books are (and they are good, very-good), they just don't offer much more than what Levinson provided in condensed form within "Guerrilla Marketing Weapons."<P>Bottom Line? Levinson's books are terrific. In fact, although the phrase is overused, I'd say they are "must buys" for the business owner -- particularly "Guerrilla Marketing Weapons." Overall grade: B+/A-</span>

                    <span>This book is almost ten years old. There is really nothing else to say. For a current intelligent read, read Guerrilla PR Wired. It's written by PR mogul Michael Levine, President of Levine Communications. Guerrilla PR Wired is written by a man who knows what he's talking about first hand and his success rate should speak for itself. Don't bother with anything else, unless you like frustrations and failure.</span>

It was easy to see exactly what I never knew and others things that I forgot.<P>Living in England it showed me just how simple this book transends across all continents and makes a dream a reality.
