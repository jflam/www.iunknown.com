                    <span>I have been trying for some time to get people on my company to read about Project Management, with no success: even if they start, they don't read more than a few chapters. This book has an exceptional advantage over many other books: It is short, instructive, readable, and fun. <p>In the last three months, I have convinced four people to read this book, lending to them the copy I bought for the company, and two of them bought a copy for themselves (I almost forgot: it is also very inexpensive :-) ). Afterwards, most of them say that the book does not contain any secrets, but it provides an excellent framework on PM, and wets their appetite for this discipline.<p>By the way, some of the best books on PM I have read come from Amacom. I'd recommend Team Based Project Management, also by James Lewis, and another great book is Information Systems Project Management, by Hallows.</span>

                    <span>Reading the reviews, there appears to be a difference of opinion about the value of this book.  This book will show anyone how to define the critical path of a project and create a PERT chart to outline the project.  If you're looking for something else, you might want to look elsewhere (no GANTT timeline charts here).  In addition, there are other excellent, succinct chapters on the art of managing projects.  Five stars, because it does exactly what it proposes to do.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a project manager. I'm a system administrator for a large website. I bought this book in my previous job because of all the projects I had to handle, either as a lead or as a key team member. Like many people, I'm often a project manager even though I'm not a Project Manager. The book helped some; I got some of the terminology down and at least now I can follow most of a technical discussion about project management.<p>That said, 80% of project management is common sense and being organized and responsible. The other 20%, the technical side, is useful, but don't fool yourself. There are probably better PM books out there, especially if you're totally unaccustomed to leading any sort of project. But if you're a pretty organized person who just wants to see what the fuss is all about, this isn't a bad choice.</span>
