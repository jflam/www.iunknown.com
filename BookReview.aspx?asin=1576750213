                    <span>In 1999, I read this book 3 times, during what I still say had to have been the worst possible time in my life.  It was a time of profound family betrayal, or acceptance of what I didn't want to believe about who my family really is, what they had expected of me for my 43 years of life, and the role that I blindly held.  This book was a painfully compelling book for me to read, yet one that had supported me through my crisis, and led me to convert my family history into becoming a public speaker, a gender-based self-esteem coach, and a journalist.  Last week, I decided to read this again, as I noticed that I am being invited to events that signal to me that I have made giant steps since reading this book in 1999.  I am so excited about writing and presenting tailored training to make a difference in each of my client's lives.  I had written so many introspective documents, for so long, that now, even though I continue to introspectively write, I am consciously and unconsciously talking as someone who is here to make a difference in everyone whose life I do touch in some way.  I have found a level of peace through reading Richard J. Leider's book that required me to look deeply in my soul and befriend everything about myself.  I actually giggle when I reread my journals from 1999, where I had written profound painful feelings that I experienced.  I giggle because I see how I weathered my way through living the life I am meant to live. I gave myself or found in myself gifts that I definitely approve of having.<p>Regardless of where you are in your life, I suggest that you read this book, with a pen in hand to write down what you are thinking and feeling.  Accept that this will be scary, at first.  Do this, knowing that you deserve to love yourself for all who you are -- you are sent here to make a difference.</span>

                    <span>Richard J. Leider believes everyone needs to find an individual sense of unique purpose. When you have this sense of purpose, you can use it as a central core of direction to guide your life and give it meaning. The book is simply written, easy to understand and targeted to a general audience. However, it also seems quite repetitious, in that the same ideas are explained many different ways. Some of these concepts are quite familiar, echoing some basic ideas about the importance of having a sense of mission, path, and goals, much like Laurie Beth Jones' book, The Path: Creating Your Mission Statement.... Finally, while some readers may respond deeply to Leider's spiritual and religious references, others may find them problematic, given the split in the business community about spirituality in the workplace. We...  recommend this book for readers who have not yet considered this mission-focused dimension of life planning and for managers who wish to understand this perspective.</span>

                    <span>Power of Purpose would make a great magazine article, but there is not enough content here to make a good book.  "Creating Meaning in Your Life..." is not what this book is about.  There is lots of talk about  how important it is to have purpose in your life, but little about how to  create it.  Mr. Leider has a great reputation -- it must have come from his  other books.</span>

These are all eternal questions that have crossed everyone's mind.  Richard Leider's book  addresses these questions, and prompts you to look deep inside yourself to  find the answer.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I happened upon the 1985 copy of this book, in a used bookstore, and have read this 3 times, to draw out more of my worthiness, more of my hidden strengths, and to do some things that up to reading this, I secretly  believed that I couldn't do.  This book is for every human being.  I had  spent years asking myself what my mission in life was, and years denying  myself my right to my mission.  Now I have a mission that defines  everything that I do, and don't do.  It empowers me to separate who I am  from who my interlocutor is, to seek kindred spirits, and to never stop  growing, according to who I am, and where I am "traveling."  I am  eternally grateful for this book, for being my guide to my rising above a  level of betrayal that others would have prefered I define myself as being  limited to.</span>
