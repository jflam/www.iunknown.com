                    <span>If you buy this book, make sure you get another review book. This bok is good for one thing, review for the actaul test. You should savfe this and take thetests in it about a week before you will take the actual regents. It has real past regents, and it explains the answers, but it will not have too much of an effect on your regents grade. It has more of a use as an indicator of how well you will do on the actual regents.</span>

                    <span>This book is good because it gives you many example problems that really were on the Regents and many of the problems appear again and again just with different numbers. It was very helpful and after doing all the problems and self-correcting myslef and then see why I got the answers wrong (or even right) by the explanation section, it was worth the time and money to get this book. It is a tool that will help you get through your studing in a great way.</span>

                    <span>Barron's Regents Exams and Answers : Earth Science is one of the most valuable tools in studying for the New York state regents exam in Earth Science. It has many of the past regents to practice from, answers explained, and tips for when you take the regents. In the answers explained section it will tell you why the answer is right and even why other answers are wrong! I got a 95 on the regents with the help of this book. If you are taking Earth Science I would highly recommend that you get this book.</span>
