                    <span>I bought this book but didn't know yet to whom it belonged.  It is a very well put together book - excellent editing and organization with easy to read sections so that busy activists don't feel obliged to sit down and read it all at one sitting.<p>This past weekend, I had the opportunity to teach a Reiki course to a young Spiritual Activist with more "fire in the belly" than any individual I've met for a very long time.  I knew at once that the book was for him.  <p>Now, I'll get another one so that I'll be ready for the next Spiritual Activist that needs a little bit of encouragement in daily doses along the way.  That's what this book does, supports the idea of living as you believe, walking your talk, in a wonderful format.<p>Some of us know that we are supposed to be "out there" doing the activism thing on the forefront.  Others have the same fire within our hearts and can find ways that support the effort and the spirit within in a manner that works for us.  Spiritual Activism supports each of those needs.  <p>A wonderful gift for a budding young activist or an old pro.  If you buy one for yourself, be sure to share it with someone else!</span>

                    <span>This is a restful, inspiring, fun and easy book for those in the trenches of social justice work, or anyone else with visions of making the world or her/his own life more peaceful and delightful.<p>First, you need to have it just for the graphic design and ease of use. Open to any page, graze, and you will find a tidbit of fine advice, a personal story, an observation, a quote--something to enrich your day.  All laid out in big print, with beautiful fonts, plenty of white space, and boxed out parcels.  You can read this like a novel, but also play around.  Shaded grays jump out at you with excerpts from all the world's major and some minor spiritual traditions--wisdom literature in bite-sized pieces, very digestible.<p>The author's confessional honesty about her challenges to find meaningful rituals for life events, and her creativity in developing them, make this book feel like a good sit-down with a buddy.<p>Even those with years of spiritual reflection and practice will find this book a great refresher, a patchwork quilt to warm and soothe life's hurdles and also a terrific guidebook for making small celebrations.  It's fun.  It's profound.  I find this book ideal for a holiday/birthday/any time gift.</span>
