                    <span>In 1998 I'd seen a photo on a calendar of the Vermillion Cliffs in Utah, but had no idea where exactly it was located.  I teach photography and my students and I had done some research to find it, but discovered it was a very large area.  When I found Mr. Dykinga's book I was even more determined for my students to see and photograph the area.  Needless to say, the book is truly inspirational thanks to Jack's remarkabe work.!<br>	If you know a photographer or a traveller - this is the book for them!  Enjoy the treat yourself as well.<p>Jeff Grimm<br>Bedford, TX</span>

                    <span>The number of photographic works exploring the nuances of the Colorado Plateau is seemingly endless.  Many can be browsed once and left behind.  This book is the scintillating exception.  <p>Jack Dykinga's photographic work is simply exceptional, and beyond the pale.   Each color photograph appears as exquisitely crafted as a piece of fine crystal, beginning with very cover of the paperback edition.  One can only envy his great patience and expertise in composing each work. <p>Much of the photography comes from the Paria Wilderness, an area of the Plateau not usually treated to any degree in most works, and the novelty is refreshing.  A particularly enjoyable facet of the book is that use of a telephoto lens has been largely eschewed, leaving a series of scenes that the enterprising tourist can find and view with his or her own eyes, just as depicted by the book. <p>Charles Bowden's accompanying text is evocative and hearkens a wild diffusion of images and memories of the fascinating region. <br>It is an apt companion to Dykinga's superb work. <p>If you are limited to five or less books about the Colorado plateau, let this be one of them.  I enjoy it more every time I read it.</span>
