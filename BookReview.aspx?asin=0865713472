                    <span>I love this book! <p>Although it's focus is specifically on facilitating participatory decision making, it is an excellent resource for all who facilitate or teach. I particularly like the concrete suggestions on how to navigate a whole-room discussion (stacking, mirroring, paraphrasing, etc.). <p>However, my favorite part of this book is a beautifully done 3-page section describing common difficult situations - someone is making jokes in the back, your audience is falling asleep, one person won't shut up. The book goes on to detail the ways that facilitators usually deal with these problems, every one of them a power play of some sort, and offers suggestion for BETTER ways to handle the situation. As a trainer myself, I rely heavily on this book when I conduct "train the trainers" sessions. <p>Especially for those who train around sensitive or controversial issues, this information is invalauable. Thanks for writing this book!</span>

                    <span>Although I had never facilitated a meeting before, this book provided me with plenty of good practical ideas and just the right amount of theory to help me successfully facilitate a major brainstorming meeting.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs to get up to speed quickly on the subject of facilitation.</span>

                    <span>I've been facilitating for several years; I often have people ask for a book recommendation , and this is always the one I name. You will find this book useful if you are facilitating for the first time, or if you are an old pro. <p>Since you can read the table of contents for this book, I won't repeat it here. My favorites are the model (mentioned in several other reviews) and the different ways to build consensus.<p>There are other books that have more in depth coverage of each of the topics. What Kaner and his colleagues have done is get to the "gems" of those books for you. It is as if a friend read a bunch of literature on this topic and boiled it all down into one easy-to-use manual. (No, I don't know any of the authors :-))<p>My only complaint about this book is the format. I find the graphics and the multiple fonts a little difficult to read. I usually hand out the book with the disclaimer "it looks a little hokey, but the content is really solid." If you can move past the graphic design, you'll love this book.</span>

                    <span>This book takes apart the process of participatory decision-making and gives practical, easily workable ways to learn and teach it. It's the best how-to I have seen on this subject.</span>

                    <span>Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision-Making provides trainers and  facilitators with skills beyond basic facilitation skills training. If you  are knowledgable of how facilitation differs from leading and managing,  then this is the next book for you. <p>Of particular use is the model of  how participatory decsion making occurs. Understanding this model and  sharing it with teams (and management) that you facilitate will take the  guess work out of team decision making.<p>Included also are suggested tools  to use at different points in the process of decision making. <p>Overall, a  great resource for facilitators. Useful for both profit and non profit  environments.</span>
