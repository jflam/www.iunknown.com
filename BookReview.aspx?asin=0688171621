                    <span>Hilarious!!! I couldn't put it down. While some of it can be misconstrewed as offensive, consider the source. He pokes fun at himself as much as he does at Hanson, Bill Gates, and, best of all, Martha Stewart. Read It!!!</span>

                    <span>You have to remember what makes Jon Stewart funny on TV.  It is not only his lines, but his delivery and accompanying facial expressions.  Some of the vignettes in this book could be funny with his delivery.  Some would not be even amusing with Mr. Stewart delivering them at his best.  
<br />
<br />The book is made up of various vignettes about people living, dead and fictitious.  I found some mildly amusing (like Bill Gates and some of the Jewish humor), some awful (cult leader) and some that were amazingly dated for a 1999 publication (the Hansens).
<br />
<br />Even if you are a big Stewart fan I think you will find yourself skipping and skimming through much of this book.  My advice would be to close the book and watch "The Daily Show".</span>

                    <span>I got this book because I enjoy watching the The Daily Show, however was very disappointed after reading the book.  Stewart's attempts at short stories fall short - way short.  I gave his book two stars because I did enjoy one of the stories, but the rest didn't entertain me.  I bought this book based on several positive reviews, but if you're thinking about purchasing a humor book, look elsewhere such as Steve Martin's Pure Drivel.</span>

                    <span>While I've watched Jon Stewart for years, I really had no idea what to expect in book form.  The result was that I wasn't at all disappointed.  With its insightful and interesting take on historical and political events, accompanied by wit and humor, this one's a sure bet.  Also recently enjoyed two other books, though they are nothing like this one:  "Jonathan Strange" and "Bark of the Dogwood."</span>
