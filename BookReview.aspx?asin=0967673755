                <span id="Label1">Readers of Princess Sultana's extraordinary story, PRINCESS, were gripped by her powerful indictment of women's lives behind the veil within the royal family of Saudi Arabia. Now, Jean Sasson turns the spotlight on Sultana's two teenage daughters, Maha and Amani.  <P>As second-generation members of the royal family who have benefited from Saudi oil wealth, Maha and Amani have never known the poverty which their grandparents experienced as children. Surrounded by untold opulence and luxury from the day they were born and which they take for granted, but stifled by the unbearably restrictive lifestyle imposed on them, they have reacted in equally desperate ways.  <P>Their dramatic and shocking stories, together with many more which concern other members of Princess Sultana's huge family, are set against a rich backcloth of Saudi Arabian culture and social mores which are depicted with equal color and authenticity. We learn, for example, of the fascinating ritual of the world-famous annual pirlgrimage to Makkah as we accompany the princess and her family to this holiest of cities.  <P>Throughout, however, Sultana never tires of her quest to expose the injustices which her society levels against women. In her couragewious campaign to improve the lot of her own daughters of Arabia, Princess Sultana once more strikes a chord amongst all women who are lucky enough to have the freedom to speak out for themselves.</span>

                    <span>I was required to do a paper on this book for my government class. Well, I had other books to choose from, but I love to read about Royal families.<P>This is a very well written book, but what the Saudi women go through is very sick. I must say that I admire Princess Sultana for standing up for what she feels is only fair treatment for women. This book also exposes all the secrets of how the women royalty get treated like doormats. I think it is high time that the Western world sees what really goes on across the globe.<P>Since when is it alright for a husband to have numerous affairs when the wife is required to wear a veil in public and not even associate with a man who is of no relation to her? They already have more than one wife as it is, then they are allowed mistresses and nobody says a thing about it. I give a lot of credit to Princess Sultana that she did not allow her husband, Kareem to take on another wife and she put an end to his affairs by threatening divorce. Princess Sultana sure kept Kareem in line.<P>Princess Sultana's oldest daughter Maha ended up rebelling in her own ways. Then her son Abdullah's friend escaped with a girl the family knew to be together. Now my friends, would such a step be nessary if there were no such restrictions as to who they are to marry or not to marry?<P>Here is a family of enormous wealth, but of very little happiness. I don't mean just problems with Princess Sultana's children, but of her brothers, sisters and relatives as well.<P>Princess Sultana clarifies that she strongly believes in the Koran and from her explanations in the book, it seems that her faith does not condone treating women like they are subhumans. As I stated in another review, and it is quoted in this book: Mohammed did not ever state that a girl born is less than a boy. In fact, Mohammed states that a girl born is just as much a gift as a boy born. I may not have the exact wording here.<P>This book makes for interesting as well as educational reading.</span>

                    <span>The life of Princess Sultana - all the three books by Jean P. Sassoon on this woman's life - have been such that I found it difficult to put them down. Sultana is so very frank about her weaknesses and shortcomings (especially her hatred of her brother) and yet so extremely courageous in defying to the best of her ability the limits put on her by her country and living behind the veil while in her country - yet outside of her country she can live freely - showing her face to the world - These books have been absolutely fasinating to learn about the mistreatment, rapes of young non-royals, and have shown me just how extremely fortunate we as American women are. What a courageous - brave woman to jepordize her position to have Jean Sasson write her story. - I hope one more book will be written to see Sultant'a perspective of the USA and Saudia Arabia after 9/11/01.</span>

                    <span>I am an arabic young woman, and i loved the book. Princess Sultana conveys her opinions and she had the courage to stand up and tell the world what she was going through.<P> Such activities of torture and harm which were described in the book, are not allowed in arabic countries and they are unacceptable in out faith as Muslims. Our Prophit Says that a boy and a girl are equal in everything. <P> As for the practice of having more than one wife has a reason, which is because of the need of a husband to have children if his wife is barren, so he marrys a woman other than his wife and he keeps his original wife for a very important reson and so that loved ones are not seperated , because having mistresses is not allowed in our faith. BUT that does not mean he is allowed to be unfair between wives (Ex. spending more time or money on one more than the other) , Islam INSISTS on the importance of fairness between wives. and that men who will not be fair with their wives are not allowed in islam to marry a second because he would be harming his wife. <P> Arabic women are educated and are working in very high positions. the world has changed a lot since her diary has been written and published, and arabic countries have became so much better. the things that sultana's family were doing are not right things, and they must not be mistaken to be the way that arabic families are. You must keep this in mind when reading this book.</span>

                    <span>I thought Princess was a very well written, and engaging book. I had no idea that some of the things discussed in the book were taking place in other areas of our world, and felt humbled that I have taken my life of freedom so easily for granted.<P>Sultana often makes mention of her desire to change her country for the better, and I picked up the second book expecting that I might read of ways that she has gone about making these changes. I realize that one person, let alone a woman in Saudi Arabia, cannot make these changes overnight, but I really did not see much evidence of what she is doing... just what it is she wants changed. I didn't find myself doubting any of the events she described in her second book, but I just felt that this book was written for shock value. Chapter after chapter is written of tragic events that have taken place and I finished reading the book feeling thoroughly discouraged. I do think we all need to be educated as to what is happening to women in this country, and maybe Sultana's intent is to bring about change by getting this word out to the world. I just wasn't as impressed with this book as I was the first. It is evident that Sultana is burdened by what is going on around her, and it seems that her husband supports her desire to advance women's rights, but yet they continue to live lives of amazing luxury while often standing aside and taking a hands off approach when tragedy befalls friends and family. This was a good book, but not filled with the info I was hoping to find.</span>

                    <span>For a different perspective of life as a woman in Saudi Arabia, I recommend you read Single in Saudi by Genia. It is the rollicking and revealing story of a single American nurse working and playing in Saudi Arabia. She got away with all of the things Sultana could not in this very restrictive society.</span>
