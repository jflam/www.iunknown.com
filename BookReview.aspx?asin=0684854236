                <span id="Label1">Experiential marketing, a decidedly turn-of-the-millennium form of corporate persuasion that strives to elicit a powerful sensory or cognitive consumer response, is rapidly superseding the stodgy features-and-benefits approach generally in vogue since the gray-flannel '50s. In fact, says Bernd H. Schmitt, a professor of marketing and director of the Center on Global Brand Management at Columbia Business School, leading enterprises ranging from Gillette and Martha Stewart to Amtrak and Oprah Winfrey are already using such emotionally loaded techniques successfully to develop new products, communicate with customers, create business partnerships, build innovative cyberspace and brick-and-mortar sales outlets, and boost profits. <I>Experiential Marketing</I> presents Schmitt's insightful and thought-provoking examination of this growing trend, along with a series of suggestions (for example, how to create an "us vs. them" atmosphere) for implementing similar efforts. By dissecting a series of relevant campaigns undertaken at the leading-edge firms mentioned above, along with those at other major players such as Harley-Davidson, Volkswagen, Celestial Seasonings, and Taster's Choice, Schmitt demonstrates its effectiveness while deftly pointing out salient techniques that readers might adopt. <I>--Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>This book is definitely an eye-opener for everyone in business of all types. Experiential Marketing is a cutting-edge yet a fundamental approach to marketing, which should be taught in all business schools. Via "experiential marketing," Schmitt presents a revolutionary framework for getting in-touch with one's customers while at the same time differentiating oneself from rest of the competition. I especially liked Chapter 9 where Schmitt lucidly illustrates the "Experiential Hierarchy" concept using Volkswagen Beetle examples. A well-written, easy-to-read format, which makes it a great reading even on planes.</span>

                    <span>Anyone who's read Schmitt's auspicious first book, Marketing Aesthetics (with Alex Simonson), already knows that he's the man with the boldest, most relevant ideas in Marketing today. A true polymath, Schmitt continues his deconstruction of standard marketing cliches, which other authors seem not to realize are badly showing their age.<P>This book takes a holistic approach to Marketing, an approach which is unabashedly consumer-centric. What do products MEAN to consumers? What is it that people experience in the act of consumption? Schmitt answers these questions and more, in supple prose which belies the wealth of concrete recommendations the book contains.<P>In a world where so much of marketing and business school education is reduced to Excel spreadsheets, Schmitt's take on the sheer anima of Marketing is a breath of fresh air. If you work in Marketing or know anyone who does, this is the book for you</span>

                    <span>Experiential Marketing strives to make its case that it's important to relate to customers on an emotional basis. Given how much the decision-making process is linked to emotions and not just sheer logic, Schmitt makes a powerful argument that customers need to feel an emotional connection to the company they purchase from. Schmitt does an excellent job of writing a fascinating piece that is sure to help take marketing into the next step. It's as good as Guerilla PR: Wired, which explores how to use that same emotional connection via the Internet and other technological methods.</span>

                    <span>From the perspective of someone who works intimately with major consumer brands, this book was a huge disappointment. There is absolutely nothing new here, as should be evident when most of the approaches held up as paragons of experiential marketing are 5-15 years old. Schmitt acts as though moving past "features and benefits" advertising is a new and controversial idea, when in fact marketing to people's emotions and aspirations has been accepted practice for at least 15 years. Is academia (Schmitt being a professor, not a practicioner) that far behind what has actually been going on in marketing departments and advertising agencies for so long?<P>Not to mention that every possible brand tactic under the sun can fall under the wide umbrella of "experiential marketing" -- and Schmitt attempts to make examples from virtually any good marketing idea of the last decade in a cluttered and undisciplined format. <P>I guess I wouldn't be so peeved if I were brand new to the world of mass marketing, and maybe this book wouldn't be such old news. But even for the neophyte, it's nothing more than a collection of neat marketing ideas with little of a distinct theme to hold them together.<P>If you want to read about accepted marketing tactics of top brands, it's an OK read, but those examples are all around us anyway. If you want to learn how these ideas originated or how you can think about your brand in a new way, it's of no help.</span>
