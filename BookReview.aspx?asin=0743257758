                <span id="Label1">At the center of <I>A Girl Becomes a Comma Like That</I>, Lisa Glatt's heroic, hauntingly honest debut, is Rachel Sparks, a thirtysomething college professor who moves back home to sit with her mother while the older woman succumbs to terminal cancer. Glatt frames Rachel's story against a backdrop of women who range in age from 16 to 60, all of whom struggle with the conflicting sense of power versus the chilling vulnerability that seems so essential to their roles as women. <p>  Although Rachel's mother's fate is apparent from the first chapter, Glatt does a commendable job of keeping the reader interested in her characters throughout the entire novel. We follow Rachel as she jumps from man to man, focusing on minute details while ignoring the basic flaws that make these men so fundamentally wrong for her. Along the way we get to know Rachel's student Ella Bloom, who must confront her cheating husband after less than a year of marriage. Ella's days are spent at a women's health clinic treating patients like 16-year-old Georgia Carter, who repeatedly exposes herself to sexually transmitted diseases in the hopes that one of these boys will show her the real affection that she can't get at home. ("Other men and boys noticed Georgia. It was as if they saw straight up inside her, all that she had done ... She understood that her body belonged to the whole damn street.")<p>  While Glatt does an admirable job of showing women's weaknesses--and strengths--when dealing with men, it is her remarkable understanding of the tumultuous relationship that women have with their own bodies that makes this novel unique. From mastectomies to reconstructive surgeries to abortions to virtually anonymous sex, Glatt skillfully demonstrates how complex a woman's relationship with both her body and mind can be, and the tremendous power one often has over another. <I>--Gisele Toueg</I></span>

                    <span>I am so in love with this book, even though it's a little weak in a few spots. It's like the author was trying a little too hard to make a group of unrelated short stories hang together. However, this shouldn't stop you from reading this book. It's phenomenal and the strengths more than make up for the weaknesses.<P>This is one of the books that once you read, you'll want everyone you know to read so you can have someone to talk about it with.</span>

                    <span>A mother dying of breast cancer who wants to love, a daughter with a revolving door into her bedroom but a Beware sign on her heart, a desperate, acerbic friend whose lips puff like down pillows and beds a man because she likes that he likes her, a woman who obsesses over her husband's infidelity, and a teenage girl with moxie who lends out her body like a library book while her father pines over the mother that left them behind: Elizabeth, Rachel, Angela, Emma, and Georgia are the central figures in Lisa Glatt's auspicious novel-in-stories, A Girl Becomes a Comma Like That. <P>The novel shifts between the women's points of view from 1997-2000, all bearing the weight of someone leaving. At the center is poetry teacher, Rachel Spark, who has been coping with her chipper mother, Elizabeth's bought with terminal breast cancer. For over six years, Rachel has remained in her mother's home, ferreting Elizabeth to chemo sessions, cosmetic surgery and leech therapy all amidst Rachel's own unraveling. A bevy of men haunt her bedrooms with their accents, their stories and finally, after an unprotected one-night stand with a Brit and a mother who creeps quickly towards death, Rachel finally confronts loss and the possibility of life after her mother. <P>During the day, Emma Bloom lectures girls about safer sex, sees girls with round bellies, STD cancers that fester and spread, infecting a girl's body and stands side-by-side with the woman she found kissing her husband (a man who studies bats) and wonders about love, what does it imply, who does it implicate and how it is possible that one can love and be comforted too soon. Most compelling is Georgia. A teenager alone with a brother who longs for escape from their cold home, a despondent father, and a mother who has taken up house with another - Georgia's body is this thing - this empty thing that gives her power. <P>Bodies are merely an assortment of parts that can be manipulated and molded to get one through one's day. A breast implant provides posture, balance - a mouth is an oracle to quiet with cruel words or silence through oral sex, - Lisa Glatt's debut is all at once an uncomfortable and unflinching look about women's complicated relationship with their bodies. Many of the characters bear the weight of abandonment by their loved ones and often are left to raise themselves. Disease with respect to relationships and the body is so intricately linked which raises an eye to the close relationship between sex, death and love. <P>Glatt's dialogue is authentic, prose sparkles and many of the passages are absolutely heartbreaking. The structure is a bit rough at times with the reader having to flip back and forth to locate oneself in time (same with long passages that switch between present/past tense), however, that aside, A Girl Becomes a Comma Like That is honest, pensive and uncompromising.</span>

                    <span>Glatt will keep you enthralled as you follow the lives of several complex and multifaceted women dealing with issues small(sexual preferences) and large(death and infidelity). Has a Sex in the City feel, but much grittier and raw. Don't look for a cookie cutter ending to this novel. Rachel and the other characters in this book are far too real for a Disney ending.</span>

                    <span>with a title like this, it's difficult not to expect a huge payback, and i wasn't disappointed in the least. this book is about women negotiating their bodies (sex, disease, beauty, autonomy) through experience, imagination, and language. i found myself intrigued by the different narrative threads (rachel, ella, georgia, angela) that cross paths but lead to very distinct and dramatic existences. i was surprised at how intelligent this book was, very unlike the chick-lit offerings i have read lately (which i also enjoyed but they didn't leave me thinking). in fact i'm still sorting a few things out, much like the characters in this book who arrive at their own happiness or grief on their own terms, after having made their own choices. i was also glad to see that this book wasn't preachy or heavy-handed about feminism or pro-choice issues. this book is about real women in real situations. it's odd--i feel as if i learned something here about coming to grips with happiness or grief. this is a good book about women like me who have to grow old and sick in our bodies while having to deal with men. this book is SO on the mark!!!</span>
