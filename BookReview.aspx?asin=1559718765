                <span id="Label1"><I>Bill Fortney's Great Photography Workshop</I> is a complete how-to guide for the impassioned amateur outdoor photographer-the fastest growing segment of the market. Major camera manufacturers report an enormous upswing in sales of upper-end equipment to non-professionals, and this book aims at serious amateur photographers who are making substantial investments in equipment.   <P>This book is a fresh approach to the age-old desire of serious amateurs to become truly good at their chosen craft. Most books produced over the past two decades have focused either on technical considerations or the esthetics of photography. Few have integrated both important issues into one volume, and none has presented an actual course of action to help readers develop excellence at their craft.   <I>Bill Fortney's Great Photography Workshop</I> contains actual self-assignments and field exercises to help the reader become fluent with each of the major concepts. In addition, the book addresses the emotional stumbling blocks to the learning process. A portfolio section includes work samples from serious amateurs who have followed the author's course to arrive at professional skill levels. Finally, the book contains a full bibliography of other source materials.</span>

                    <span>This is an average book similar to so many photography books that give you an introduction to/overview of landscape/outdoor/nature/whatever photography. Nothing in this book sets it apart from the crowd. The "workshop" part is almost non-existent -- just a few brief, vague "self assignments" at the end of each chapter.</span>

                    <span>If you have the chance to read the introductory pages or if you will read the recommendations from other readers - for sure you will get excited about this book. And you will feel proud for your choice in buying it:-)) For sure Bill Fortney is a good manager for the business he runs (including good knowledge of promoting his book), he may be a good professional photographer but this book could be better. Interestening details are extremely poor or just mentioned in hurry. This is why I believe beginners could find much better books and advanced amateurs either. Try "John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide" and you will have a *****book!</span>

                    <span>A short flip through the pages of this book and it soon becomes obvious that Bill Fortney is undoubtedly a master photographer. Inside "Bill Fortney's Great Photography Workshop" you will find page after page of sound photographic advice complete with illustrations and examples. While it is a technical presentation in many aspects, he also clearly shows that great photography is every bit as much an art form as it is a technical knowledge. Besides discussions of such things as shutter speed and aperture and how they affect the picture he delves into the importance of the right light, composition, seeing with an artistic eye, and using filters (especially the effect of a good polarizing filter). If you like photography you will leave the book excited about the possibilities before you as you apply what you have learned. This is a highly recommended read for any photography enthusiast.</span>

                    <span>Excellent, well written. This is definitely a photo course in book form. From the inclusion of amateurs' work to the use of a pleasently large font this book does exactly what it sets out to do- improve your photography. The self assignments (of which I have already done some and do without realising it) , which are easy to do are instructive and provide immediate feedback in many cases. The tone of the book is straightforward, informative, humorous and down to earth, a rarity. At the worst the pictures will inspire to get up and go shooting, at the best after trying the assignments and treating it like the text it is, your photography should improve.</span>
