                <span id="Label1">What do flashlights, the British invasion, black cats, and seesaws have to do with computers? In CODE, they show us the ingenious ways we manipulate language and invent new ways to communicate with each other. And through CODE, we see how this ingenuity-and our very human compulsion to communicate-have driven the technological innovations of the past two centuries. Now in paperback edition, this critically praised book weaves an inventive and eminently comprehensible narrative for anyone who's ever wondered about the secret inner life of computers and other smart machines. The work of legendary computer book author Charles Petzold has influenced an entire generation of programmers. And with CODE, Microsoft Press is proud to share this gifted teacher and communicator with every reader interested in understanding today's world of PCs, digital media, and the Internet.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I am a computer programmer by trade and sincerely wish I had this book 7 years back when I started formal education.  During my 4+ years in the higher education system, and even after, I and my classmates (later colleagues) were taught how to program computers (in various languages) and many of the higher level ideas in programming (Data Structures, Algorithms, Program Structure, Etcetera, Etcetera, Etcetera) but we never really learned how the computers worked inside.  Even to many trained programmers, or at least me:), these beige boxes can be something of a magical black box which we don't really understand at a fundamental beyond the point of it processing the instructions we give it in our chosen programming language.  In school I recieved perhaps one single semester course that attempted to teach how these things worked inside, yet that course still skimmed on the inner workings, the teacher instead spent his time on how monitors drew pixels on the screen and how laser printers worked.....
<br />
<br />Looking back on it, I would blame the ignorance of the inner workings of computers that some programmers have on the decline of having to learn Assembly language (starting in the early nineties?), the lowest level programming language sans actual Machine Code, where one would be forced to deal with the raw inner workings of a computer naturally.  I myself hope to learn it one day after reading this book :D  Instead, I was taught the C programming language and what we learned in school became only more abstract in regards to the actual hardware...
<br />
<br />This is where this wonderful book came into play.  Since I recieved it half-a-year ago, it must have been read/devoured by me a dozen times or more - it goes from teaching the make-up of various codes (morse, braille, etcetera) to showing how some simple to understand concepts can be combined until a working computer, calculator, etcetera, can be built....... it gives one a great foundation for learning what Computer Science is all about or gives a newer-generation Programmer, like me, much needed knowledge on how that beige box basically works, on a hardware level!
<br />
<br />The best thing is that those computer analogies can be finally thrown out the window - we all heard them before - like how "ram is like a table, or workspace. The bigger it is, the more things you can have ready and available at one time. The hard drive is like your drawers and cabinets. You can store more stuff there, but to use it, you have to take it out first and put it either on the table (RAM) or hold it in your hand (cache)."  Petzold also uses analogies when he introdues topics but quickly moves beyond them, giving his audiences real understanding of the subject - which is very welcoming since analogies tend to explain function well but break down quickly when one is determined to learn more about a topic.
<br />
<br />It is probably one of the few computer books on my shelf that can't get outdated and that's good, because it still will be there in 20 years.</span>

                    <span>I am the manager of a computer store and a graphic/web designer and as such I use and troubleshoot computers every day and know rather a lot about them.
<br />
<br />This book looked interesting because on the jacket it uses phrases like, "illuminating narrative" and "eminently comprehensible" and "no matter what your level of technical savvy".
<br />
<br />In reality though after the 1st few chapters the book falls into an absolute quagmire of circuit diagrams and boolean logic tables and RAM address schemes and loses all sense of narrative or comprehensibility.
<br />
<br />Unless you are really into math and/or are a programmer I would highly recommend AVOIDING THIS BOOK.
<br />
<br />I am not a stupid person nor unfamiliar with computers but this was wayyyy beyond where I wanted to go with this. And my guess is that it's way beyond for most other folks as well.
<br />
<br />If you are interested in learning how computers work I would highly suggest the series titled "How Computers Work" by Ron White. 
<br />
<br />(...)
<br />
<br />'How Computers Work' contains very clear diagrams and explanations that while technical aren't at the picky and obtuse levels reached in the book 'Code'.

                    <span>This book is a fun overview of the evolution of computing as we know it today.  Starting with basic building blocks from years past (relays, telegraph, etc.) we move to the present (transistors, ICs).  With a little motivation one could build a functional logic computer from the knowledge gained by this book.
<br />
<br />The book is written in a very accessible manner, I would recommend it highly to a high school graduate considering pursuing a college career in any electronic engineering discipline.</span>

                    <span>If you are a geek you will love this book! As a programmer I found this book to be very interesting. I've read other reviews complaining that this book is for novice computer users, I completely disagree! Most developers work in a world of high level languages that completely abstract the inner workings of the computer's CPU and memory. This book manages to teach the reader the most basic elements of how a computer works starting with an intriging look at the basic physics of electricty and building up all the way to Assembly language.  This book should be mandatory reading for all CS majors. </span>

                    <span>The books starts off great, but later drowns in tedious details about the construction of complex circuits. I can't be too critical since it is apparently the purpose of the book to give such details, and I'm glad it didn't have the opposite problem of dumbing it down too much, but I think it could have been done better with the intended audience in mind.</span>
