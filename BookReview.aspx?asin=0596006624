                <span id="Label1">"The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, in which you can shoot anyone you wish with your ideas, if you're willing to risk the consequences. "--from <i>Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age</i>, by Paul Graham  We are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers.  Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?  Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.  <i>Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age</i>, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls "an intellectual Wild West."  The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, Internet startups, and more.  And here's a taste of what you'll find in <i>Hackers & Painters</i>:  "In most fields the great work is done early on. The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed. Shakespeare appeared just as professional theater was being born, and pushed the medium so far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow. Albrecht Durer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austen with the novel.  Over and over we see the same pattern. A new medium appears, and people are so excited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first couple generations. Hacking seems to be in this phase now.  Painting was not, in Leonardo's time, as cool as his work helped make it. How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can do with this new medium."  Andy Hertzfeld, co-creator of the Macintosh computer, says about <i>Hackers & Painters</i>:"Paul Graham is a hacker, painter and a terrific writer.  His lucid, humorous prose is brimming with contrarian insight and practical wisdom on writing great code at the intersection of art, science and commerce."  Paul Graham, designer of the new Arc language, was the creator of Yahoo Store, the first web-based application. In addition to his PhD in Computer Science from Harvard, Graham also studied painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. </span>

                    <span>A friend of mine introduced me to this book and I am glad that he did. While I am not a programmer and, as a result, got lost a couple of times in the essays, "Beating the Averages" and "The Dream Language", I wholeheartedly recommend this book. <P>It clearly and crisply explains the art and science of programming and where it fits into a larger historical and social context. It also provides many thought-provoking insights for technical and non-technical folks alike.<P>You can see in Graham's writing style his passion for simple, succinct prose as well as code. It was a very pleasurable read.</span>

                    <span>Nerds will like the book, even if they feel defensive or irritated by Graham's comments that hit too close to home. <P>Hypersensitive types (pedants, "experts") should avoid the book -- Graham will gore your sacred cow, and the fact that such an insolent non-expert has cashed out with many millions will bother you. You'd best read something else.<P>If you are a programmer (who doesn't hack lisp), the book may really make you wonder. You may think that your favorite language is the best -- but do you really have enough experience to back it up? <P>Graham knows the languages you know. He chooses lisp. He and two other programmers built a $49 million company in 3 years. In the same time period, you didn't. In the "Fantasy Football" sense, you got whupped. <P>If this intrigues you, check out "On Lisp" (avail free online), by the same author, as it illustrates those things that a lisp master can do that you cannot.</span>

                    <span>Hello Paul,<BR>I read your essays "Hackers and Painters" and "Taste for<BR>Makers", and I find them GREAT, even if many months later<BR>the first publication.<P>I searched the Internet since 1995+ for texts like yours,<BR>but I was able to find *zero* occurrencies of the big<BR>evidence: painters and hackers share common traits.<P>Of course, they are akin not in the foolish sense that one<BR>can write a program to display some pixels at random or<BR>fixed positions.<BR>Instead, painters and hackers are equals in taste, design,<BR>and skecthing.<P>I studied painting at Accademia di Belle Arti in Milan, but<BR>I thinker with computers since I was 12, I started with an<BR>Apple IIe clone built by my brother (when he was 18) using<BR>a do-it-yourself kit.<BR>Now I work as a "corporate drone" programmer in Milan.<P>That's why when I read your essays I was so impressed:<BR>I am not smart enough to be a "real hacker," AND I am not<BR>good enough to be a famous painter, but today this Middle<BR>Land seems to me no longer too much strange.<P>Thanks Paul,<BR>Claudio Destro<P>PS:<BR>To be a painter or to be an hacker, that's the question.<P>I really need to stress the fact that I am really split in<BR>two personalities (as seen from the outside, of course.)<BR>In fact, when I was 14~15, I was really stucked (for about<BR>two years) on the following (in)decision: to study fine<BR>arts or to study information technology?<P>Did I choose correctly? The fact that now I am a "corporate<BR>drone" programmer makes me think "No, I did not choose<BR>correctly."

                    <span>Every so often a book comes along that blows the cobwebs out of some dark corner of my mind. "The Naked Ape", "Sperm Wars", "Guns, Germs, and Steel", and "The Mating Mind" for example;<BR>each in its own way exhibiting our favorite species as a very different critter from the one we gawk at in the mirror.<P>I got a similar feeling reading the first third of "Hackers and Painters", reading about the prisons we call schools.and the nursuries we call suburbia.<P>The discussion of economics contains fewer original ideas, but explains clearly some things that every educated person needs to understand, but maybe nobody ever told you. The first half of the book will make fun reading for your active mind.<P>You have to be a hacker yourself to want to read the second half. At this point the purpose of the book is revealed - subtle ad copy for a new computer language called "arc". The first half are the apologia ( well, prologia ) justifying the audacity of saying out loud that for some purposes, lisp might be a better language than cobol, and forefending the dreaded charge of hate speech. <P>This is not, however, the endless Holy War between the acolytes of vi and emacs, which was once quashed with "editors, what editors, when I program I just type into the standard input of the compiler".<P>There's some tantalizing evidence that he's right.<P>I once got into a discussion with a very bright logician about the nature of mathematics. He was arguing that mathematics is the same thing as set theory, I was arguing that mathematics is the study of interesting axiomatic systems. In some sense it's a stupid argument - one of definitions. In another it's a tribal war over intellectual territory. But it's also possible that it goes to the nature of things in some intrinsic way. From the experience of the last nearly two decades, we can't settle that debate. I don't know if I was right or wrong, or even how meaningful the question was. But we do know now that mathematics is much more than set theory - the theory of topoi, which arose historically from algebraic topology, via category theory and algebraic geometry, subsumes set theory, and is by now clearly a more appropriate foundation for mathematics.<P>Now that we know that the typed lambda calculi of computational theory are precisely the same objects as the topoi of mathematical category theory, we have the curious coincidence tha t a central foundational notion of logic is identical to the central foundational notion of mathematics. When you get to the same rich ideas from multiple directions, particularly when the roads remember centuries of hard travel, it's time to sit up and pay attention.The last time this happened on that kind of scale, Descartes ushered in the scientific era.<P>It's probably not outrageous to suggest that a language which has the expressive power of this intellectual Rome could be more useful than one that does not - a suggestion made with intelligence, insight, and expensive anecdotal evidence.<P>Time for me to get serious about lisp</span>

                    <span>This is an astonishingly good collection of essays. In lesser hands, any of the 15 essays here could have been a book by itself --- each packs more content than you can find in a typical one idea business book, or a typical one technology book for geeks. Yet his book is not dense or difficult: Graham's graceful style is a pleasure to read. <P>But what is it? Is it a business book, or a technical book? A bit of both actually, with a pinch of social criticism thrown in. There are essays on business --- particularly startups --- and essays on programming languages and how to combat spam, and one delightful one on the difficulty being a nerd in American public schools.<P>My favorite essay of the 15 --- and picking a favorite is itself a challenge --- is called "What you can't say". It is about heresy, not historical Middle Ages burned-at-the-stake heresy, but heresy today in 2004. And if you believe nothing is heretical today, that no idea today is so beyond the pale that it would provoke a purely emotional reaction to its very utterance, then read some of the other reviews. Graham's idea is not that all heresies are worth challenging publicly, or even that all heresies are wrong, but merely that there is value is being aware of what is heretical, so one can notice where the blind spots are.<P>Astonishingly good.</span>
