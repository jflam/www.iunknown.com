                    <span>This book was amazing. Ok, I admit, the beginning was a bit slow. But once you got into it, you just can not put it down. It's a captivating read that kept me at the edge of my seat. All the while, I was learning SAT vocabulary. It's like killing two birds with one stone!!! WOW</span>

                    <span>First of all, out of the 1,046 or however many words that are touted as SAT vocab words, less than 10% are words an enterinf freshman (high school, of course) should not already know. I mean, 'pallor'? Seriously. The story is not the best, (...).<br>If you have money to throw around, go ahead and buy it. After about 50 pages, you might actually find a word you didn't know.</span>

                    <span>I (...)like the previous person, was assigned this book for required reading. The SAT vocabulary used in the story is simple, 5th graders should be able to comprehend what these words mean. The plot is dull and insipid, and the author strains to use the SAT vocabulary, making the dialogue seem too unreal (no one that age uses those words in their daily vocabulary) and eventually taking away from the story, making it a hard and unhelpful read.</span>

                    <span>O.k. for those looking to buy the book for their kids, buy it. Now. I am a private tutor of high school kids of all ability levels and besides relearning a few choice forgotten words, I found the story engaging and Marantz well up to the challenge. This will work for kids of the academic version of little league psychos who have mastered the under 1500 guilt trip or anyone needing to break 1000. Buy it. The book teaches and entertains. Mission successful.<p>Oh, Kaplan, DO NOT go away. You deserve chastisement (yep, it's in there) on two counts.<br>1. Your editing. The first 2/3 of the book feel like somebody did their best to geld the author and tack on the same phrases (can we have a word count on "laugh"?) in the place of inspired writing. There is clearly an external attempt to not trust the author and force the manuscript into something is for a 6th grade reading level with a lot of big words shoved in. Luckily you failed.<br>That's a serious accusation, and one I would not make were it not for the last 1/3 of the novel. All of it sudden it becomes a mature (but still kid-safe) book where Marantz pulls off some genuinely creepy moments, and affects the reader on a deeper level while keeping the stream of SAT vocab steady. Gone are extraneous phrases (characters are free to feel pain or fear without big neon arrows redundantly pointing at them) and only the quality remains. Read Marantz's bio again, and show a little trust.<p>2. On a similar theme, I would have loved to see a bit more of an effort for the writing community in general. He was serving two masters (well, three counting the orangutan editorial board) and pulled off a credible job. He lives in Los Angeles so with all of the major writers fairs and conferences going on, why is he not speaking? It's difficult enough to write for a target audience, let alone with additional constraints. Think of it this way: some of the best free-verse poets began as formalists; there's a lesson in his discipline. Forget the SAT kids for a moment, there are a lot of aspiring writers who could learn a great deal through his troubles. This would be an excellent text for college creative writing courses because of it's strengths and weaknesses. The production values of the book are excellent. Somebody must have cared. Now do yourselves (i.e. more sales), your author, and the writing community a favor.</span>

                    <span>I'm 18 and I just finished reading this book.  I gave it two stars only because of the amount of SAT words.  The book is really bad and to make it worse, it was mandatory for a class I took.  I was really disapointed at the story line and I was expecting a much better read.  The SAT words were great and there is a lot of them, but I found it more enjoyable to read magazines even though there are much less SAT words.  However, everybody learns differently.  I learn SAT words with flash cards while other people learn SAT words by reading books.  Its not a long book and it can be educational, so read it for the SAT words.  Remember those SAT words but forget the story.</span>
