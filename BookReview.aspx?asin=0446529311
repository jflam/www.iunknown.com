                <span id="Label1">No athlete has changed his sport the way Tiger Woods has transformed the  world of golf. The Tiger phenomenon has created a new legion of golfers, seduced  by Woods's almost effortless mastery of this most difficult game. In <I>How I  Play Golf</I> Woods reveals the many facets of his game and offers a plethora of  tips and advice aimed at all levels of play. Unlike most golf guides, and  perhaps somewhat surprising from a player best known for his long game, <I>How I  Play Golf</I> begins with the short game--putting, chipping, and  pitching--before moving onto swing mechanics and hitting off the tee. Produced  in conjunction with the editors of <I>Golf Digest</I>, the book is lavishly  photographed and illustrated and offers a gold mine of useful ideas and mental  images Tiger has collected over the years. Throughout, Tiger recounts memorable  shots from his relatively brief career; for example, his only "perfect" shot (a  3-wood on No. 14 at St. Andrews) and his first putt at the 1995 Masters (a  20-footer for birdie on No. 1 that missed and rolled off the green). <I>How I  Play Golf</I> is not only a first-rate instructional guide, it also communicates  a passion and respect for the game that beginners, hackers, and low handicappers  should find inspiring. Highly recommended. <I>--Harry C. Edwards</I></span>

                    <span>"How I Play Golf" by Tiger Woods is clearly written and easy to understand. It's fun to read. <P>You only have to watch Tiger Woods play to realize that he knows the secrets of how to play great golf.<P>Tiger reveals his secrets in this book. It's a MUST READ!<P>I recommend that anyone interested to learn to play golf well should get a copy of Tiger Woods' "How I Play Golf", and a copy of Ben Hogan's "Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf".<P>Take these two books apart from cover to cover, get lessons, have you're swing video-taped and analyzed, and then practice playing golf with insight and correct understanding of the game.</span>

                    <span>If you are like me, your golf swing will never be confused with Mr. Tiger Woods&#8217;s magnificent arcs. On the other hand, I enjoy watching him on television (even a lot of nongolfers do, too), and How I Play Golf is a very valuable, detailed look a how he eats, exercises, practices, prepares mentally, thinks through shots, sets up, and executes. I found this book to be the most revealing look at one golfer&#8217;s game that it has ever been my pleasure to look at and read about. Even if I can never learn anything from his game, I will certainly watch his game with a more educated eye in the future!<P>One of my major complaints about the photographs in most golf books is that the images do not illuminate what the text describes. These photographs are both well coordinated with the text, and easy to evaluate from an amateur perspective. I especially enjoyed seeing the details of the different grips Mr. Woods uses. I got several ideas for experiments to try in order to cure faults in my swing with those grip examples.<P>Another complaint about books by famous golfers is that they encourage too many people to emulate them. Mr. Woods makes it clear that this is how he plays golf, and why. In several places, he points out that his solutions will not be right for you. On the other hand, he plays with a lot of amateurs in pro-ams and studies with top teaching professionals. From those perspectives, he has a lot to say for the amateur, weekend golfer. <P>A great strength of this book is that it shows you and describes each element of the game from many different perspectives. You often see very large color photographs, from different angles. In other places, the degree of grip pressure is explored in considerable detail, with useful calibrations to experience. The text also describes why one approach works in a given situation and another one does not. For example, there are almost as many illustrations of common faults as of proper practice and performance. Seeing the &#8220;wrong&#8221; and the &#8220;right&#8221; side-by-side makes the message much clearer. In a few places, Mr. Woods also explains how his special physical skills permit him to do things that won&#8217;t work for very many other people. For example, he can feel the degree of &#8220;squareness&#8221; of the club head as it approaches the hitting zone and can make fine adjustments with his hands just before contact. He uses a grip that takes advantage of that talent. On the other hand, he cautions the reader to model the full swing on a golfer who has a similar physique and stature to oneself. <P>The book contains a lot of sound advice of the sort that you would eventually pick up by reading about 50 issues of Golf Digest. Those who want to see basics outlined all in one place will like this book. It has a lot of the richness of a Dave Pelz book, but is simplified to make the material easier to absorb and remember. <P>I also liked the way that key points are repeated throughout the book, in order to help drive them home. <P>Having watched a lot of Mr. Woods&#8217;s tournament rounds, I was pleased to see that he used many references to shots that I remember to make certain points. I was particularly impressed by his assessment that he seldom hits a &#8220;perfect shot&#8221; in remembering only one in the 12 tournaments he won in 2000. <P>Perhaps the most interesting advice in the book is to swing at only 80 percent of the effort you can make. <P>I have always found that it makes sense to build my game from the putting green back towards the tee. I was delighted to see that this book takes the same approach. Naturally, you will be tempted to skip ahead to the &#8220;blast away with the driver&#8221; sections, but do read all of the book. There&#8217;s lots of good information here. I have played with a number of pros who love to hit their drivers from the fairway. Imagine my fascination when I saw that the book has a section on how to do that. <BR> <BR>If you are like me, you will come away with increased respect for the dedication that it has taken to develop this amazing level of skill and coolness. As Mr. Woods says, there are no short cuts. In fact, he has added a lot of discipline since first winning on the tour at 21. <P>No matter what happens to you on the course, or in life . . . keep your chin up and relax!<P></span>
