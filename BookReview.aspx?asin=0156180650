                <span id="Label1">At the distance of a half-century, this satiric social fiction is both a treasure and a disappointment. Orwell's wit is priceless--and ruthless--as he describes rural Church of England parish life; the transitory culture of the hops harvest; a brothel's soiled linen; not to mention when his heroine hobnobs with the Trafalgar Square homeless of a bitter winter's night or bullies bored students in a fourth-rate private school: "Last term the girls had behaved badly, because she had started by treating them as human beings, and later on, when the lessons that interested them were discontinued, they had rebelled like human beings. But if you are obliged to teach children rubbish, you must not treat them as human beings.... Before all else, you must teach them it is more painful to rebel than to obey." <p> Orwell's compassion for Dorothy Hare, ensnared by faith, birth, and gender to toil thanklessly as her minister father's unpaid curate, is admirable, and his evocation, early in the novel, of a woman's consciousness totally subsumed by the mostly trivial demands of others stands shoulder to shoulder with the best feminist fiction. The dialogues between Dorothy and her dissolute middle-aged suitor, Mr. Warburton, concerning human nature, faith, and morality, are smart and fun to read. The problem (and here Orwell commits the sort of sin he denounces in Dickens) is that the novel's plot--Dorothy's picaresque amnesiac travels through the seamy side of English life--feels manufactured for the author's satiric purposes. Orwell never relinquishes his cleverness, or his maleness, to become his heroine, with the result that the reader never surrenders wholly to the fiction. Thus <I>A Clergyman's Daughter</I>, while a pleasure to pick up,  is not quite a book one can't put down. <I>--Joyce Thompson</I></span>

                    <span>There is a not very active Orwell newsgroup, and from timeto time newbies wander in and ask what Orwell's best booksare. Well, everyone knows about "1984" and "Animal Farm," so I usually mention that I like "A Clergyman's Daughter." I sometimes get flamed for this. But who cares? I like it! It is a kind of picaresque novel. I think my favorite part is poor Dorothy trying to be a good teacher in a very bad school, and having the parents object, saying saying things like "We don't want her taught decimals, we want her taught ARITHMETIC." Her struggles with her monster of a father is memorable, and the ending, where she cheerfully resigns herself to her fate, seems to foreshadow the ending of "1984."</span>

                    <span>Knowing what was finally going to come of Dorothy kept me until 2:30 AM this morning...and I wasn't disappointed.<P>Orwell cheats right out of the chute: In realizing that he may not know enough about women to write about our protagonist, he immediatedly removes her sexuality by telling us she is disgusted by the thought of "that." Nuff said. Our hero(ine) is now pretty much asexual. <P>What a story though. Plumbing the depths of faith and predestiny, Orwell weaves a fairly heavy tale of the motherless daugther of a grim and dispassionate minister obsessed only with his investments and petty theological particulars. <P>The minister's daughter loyally fills in the gaps, acting as the heart and soul of a failling church, praying her way against impossible odds while visiting the sick, recruiting new church goers, seeing to the buildings and her father's meals...and eventually completely wigging out.<P>Now the fun begins.<P>This is a warm and rewarding book, full of human insight and only a little bit of Orwell's patented socialist soap-boxing.</span>

                    <span>'A Clergyman's Daughter' by George Orwell (1935)<P>A clever portrait, through five chapters (with sub-chapters), of the young adult life of Dorothy Hare and those she comes into contact with. <P>As the book opens, Dorothy is the religiously-obsessed, oppressed and overworked 27 year-old spinster daughter of the Rector of St Athelstans in Knype Hill, Suffolk. The story of her life over the next eight months unfolds and develops from there... <P>This book is excellently written and is an enjoyable read from start to finish: writing of high quality touching on many of the usual themes that concern George Orwell, such as rural life, religion, education, poverty, humanity, London life, loneliness, struggling within life, human nature, greed, selfishness, etc: themes which tend to run through most of Orwell's various writings in one form or another. <P>Orwell cleverly changes the setting and nature of the book entirely, between each of the five long chapters, making the book in fact five separate and different phases within eight months of Dorothy's life within a book, thereby keeping the reader interested throughout by the use of clever shifts in the setting of the story through to the end, to avoid any risk of boring the reader. <P>We are left, at the end of the book, to decide what we think about Dorothy, having seen how she has negotiated what has happened to her in the interim and the choices she makes about her future life having regard to those events. <P>4/5</span>

It is not all I had come to expect from Orwell but it is an enjoyable book that keeps you reading for more. Read only if you are a die hard Orwell fan and then only if you are willing to accept a so-so work. Otherwise you can read it but don't expect to be blown away.</span>

                    <span>Upon mention of George Orwell, "A Clergyman's Daugter" isn't usually the book that jumps into reader's minds, and compared to his polished masterpieces -- Animal Farm and 1984 -- the reason is understandable. Yet for fans of Orwell lies an undiscovered gem, a less understated yet deliciously piercing satire of early 20th Century England, flavored abundatly with the author's trademark social criticism and wicked humor. It's a book that leaves no stone unturned, challenging religion, gender, education, social class, and both the timely and timeless inadequacies and hypocrasies of which Orwell bore witness.<P>The book's title refers, fittingly enough, to the chief protagonist, Dorothy Hare. A girl in her late twenties, she begins the book as a militant religious devotee, shown best in a pin she always keeps with her, used for pricking herself in penance for committing the slightest misdeed -- sometimes drawing blood for thinking no more than an unholy thought. She is one daughter among "ten thousand others" who lives a grueling life under the stern command of her father, the pastor, a hardened man of stern disposition and resolute aloofness, whose awkening greeting to his daugter as the novel begins is a question of when breakfast will arrive.<P>With a misadventure that begins here and ends in a place both similar and entirely different, Dorothy meets affrronts to her life, her stature, her class, even the very faith upon which the whole of her existence resides. And as Dorothy is challenged to think of the world differently, so are we; a defining moment comes when she says, "it is not what we do that matters, it is how our thinking changes because of it." As a theme to the novel and a thesis which he brilliantly defends, Orwell succeeds without hesitation. (As a note, the above quote is paraphrased, and I appologize -- I've already returned the book to the library.)<P>Where he falters -- and indeed he does -- is in the structure of the novel and, occasionally, the consistency of his language. The myriad of poetic prose almost seems to contradict his otherwise honed and scathing wit, and while often pleasing to the ear, his effors seem at best superfluous, essentially inconcequential to his underlying message. Other reviewers speak with further clarity on this topic, and I'm particularly inclined with one's opinion that only "Joyce can write like Joyce," in other words, that Orwell's language in "A Clergyman's Daughter" could at the least be called affected.<P>But these gripes on language aside, Orwell succeeds in painting a stark, grim, yet gripping picture of a society gone awry, and beckons us to look within.</span>
