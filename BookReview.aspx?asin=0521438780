                    <span>Having read several similar titles I would say that this highly readable book is perhaps the best I have come across. Flood brings the important strands together in easily manageable chapters, and includes much imortant recent scholarship.<br>To link this book or its author to an 'orientalist' agenda (as an earlier reviewer appears to) is frankly ridiculous.</span>

                    <span>Flood's writing is very dry, but he certainly knows what he is talking about.  This book is not so much an introduction for people looking to learn something new, but a great reference for those hoping to learn more.</span>

                    <span>"An Intriduction to Hinduism" is an excellent book for a beginning student of that religion. It is up to date and covers all the major topics with as much depth as any introductory work to such a huge subject could be expected to. It is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the subject, although it is, or course, only the beginning of the available material about Hinduism.</span>

                    <span>Previous reviews of this text have shown either a very strong like or dislike and I have to place myself with the former.  As noted in other reviews, the attacks are wide of the mark.  Professor Flood is one of the leading scholars within his field and has taught Hinduism for many years at various universities and both the depth of his learning and the ability to relate this in a clear but not simplistic way to students are demonstrated here.  Anyone seeking an introduction to Hinduism need look no further than this book that provides an excellent account of all its major features incorporating recent scholarship and clear analysis.  My only regret is that this book was not on the market when I was an undergraduate student!  I hope prospective readers will not be put off by the partial reviews given herein but will recognize this book as the definitive introduction to its subject, it is sure to become a classic eclipsing the older standard works entirely.</span>

                    <span>Gavin Flood's introduction is not only comprehensive, but readable.  I  have taught this book for two years now and feel that my students glean a  sense not just of Hindu traditions today but also of the history and  transformations of Hindu traditions through time.  The best thing about the  book is the subtle incorporation of the latest scholarly work on Hinduism.   At the same time, Flood appreciates the insider's perspective and what is  really significant to Hindus themselves.  Flood has conducted research in  both North and South India and is sensitive to the geographic differences  of religious practice in India.  <p>Previous reviews on amazon.com  suggesting that Flood uses the Aryan migration question as an organizing  principle of his book are ludicrous.  He devotes a total of 5 pages to this  discussion in the middle of the second chapter.  Hardly an obsession.   Furthermore, the unsubstantiated charge of Orientalism by another reviewer  also seems misplaced.  A minute's glance at the bibliography shows that  Flood has used Indological (textual), anthropological, historical, and  feminist scholarly literature to produce his introduction.<p>This is an  excellent work on the history of Hindu religious traditions that deserves a  place among the best out there.</span>
