                <DIV class="ReviewHeading">Book Description:</DIV>
                <span id="Label1">This is a canyon hiking guide to the Colorado Plateau, which covers the southeastern half of Utah, the northern half of Arizona, the western 1/5 of Colordo, and a small part of NW New Mexico.  This new 4th Edition has been undated significantly beyond the 3rd.  The author went back to almost all canyons, or at least to the trailheads, to check out the mile post markers, etc.  Also, about half a dozen less-interesting canyons or hikes from the 3rd Edition were eliminated; while about a dozen new & more challenging hikes have been added, plus another 32 pages. This 4th edition contains 320 pages and 191 fotographs, about 90 of which are new.   <P> The new canyons are from scattered locations in southern Utah, primarily in Zion National Park, and the Escalante River, San Rafael Swell & Robbers Roost country, along with major updates on slot canyons on the Navajo Nation.  Other big changes to this edition are the addition of about a dozen new technical slot canyons; that is, canyons where you need ropes and rappelling gear to get through.  This adds another dimension to excitement and challenge, and opens many new hiking areas previously closed to many of us.  All these technical canyons are now either bolted-up, or have slings or webbing around boulders, making them ready for rappelling.   <P> The general direction for this book, is toward slot canyons, which everybody likes; but it retains easy & fun hikes to canyons with Anasazi ruins, another favorite.  So if you're looking for petroglyphs or pictographs, and cliff dwellings or ruins, which some people try their best to hide, then this is your book.  In the back of this book is a section listing the Best Hikes, including for the most part Slot Canyons, then best hikes to see Indian ruins, and Native American rock arts sites. Below is the Table of Contents.</span>

                    <span>Kelsey's directions to trailheads is seriously lacking in this book. I followed his directions to a trailhead in Zion National Park, and ended up in the totally wrong canyon. This was after following his directions and mileage points to the letter!</span>

                    <span>My son and I have personally hiked many of Michael Kelsey's routes as described in this book. Yes, you need to know something about hiking and route finding, Michael does not baby you along the way or remove responsibility from the hiker. But he does not overdramatize the hikes to avoid liability, and he also does not preach to his readers. What he does do extremely well is concisely give you an idea of how to get to some of the most remote, pristine, and special places in the entire world, places innaccessible merely because most people were unaware of their existence. Michael has opened the door to these places. For this I will be forever grateful.</span>

                    <span>This is the bible of Canyoneering in SE Utah. The simple maps, concise descriptions and knowledgeable tips will get you into as much trouble as you want . . . and that's why we do this, right? The park service has baned Kelsey's books from their bookstores because he "reveals too much," and they claim people "get into trouble" following his guides -- bugger to them! People can be unprepared idiots. If you read the damn book you'll realise that only trained people should be stemming up slot canyons, swimming hypothermic plunge pools and gingerly investigating delicate Anaszi ruins -- not your average hee-haws looking for a good place to swill a 12-Pack of beer. The beer swillers don't want this book, go to Lake Powell instead.</span>

                    <span>I was glad to find this book, and got lots of ideas about places to go from it. It does have lots of useful information, but I found it to be lacking some very necessary details about the canyons needed to plan a hike to this area. Take a good map and call the local BLM office for details before going. I've seen people turn up on the local six o'clock news a couple of times because they got into a canyon they couldn't get out of using one of his books! Also, all distances are metric :( so be prepared to convert everything to feet and miles.</span>

                    <span>I really like this book, but I take it with a big chunk of salt. It has information about hikes all over the Colorado Plateau, from Zion to the Res to Grand Junction, and this is its big win - variety. A few classic canyons in each area.<P>But the information is not always accurate. Bring the map, a pack full of common sense and read with skepticism, and you'll be just fine. Be a beginner, take this as the bible and you're heading for trouble.</span>
