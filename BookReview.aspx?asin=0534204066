                    <span>My MBA class (top 20 program)used this book. But even my instructor did not recommend us to read this book. Instead he just taught class with his own hand-out. We only used this book for exercise problems. There were students who had many years of research experience. But they even complained about this book and recommended me to read Anderson's " Statistics for Business and Economics". Anyway, I think if you have a good instructor it is O.K. Otherwise I am sure that it will be very painful. Gook luck.</span>

Fortunately I have a very good intstructor so I dont even use the book.<br>Its worthless. Seems like the author is talking to himself.</span>

                    <span>Do NOT buy this book. I am sure the author understands a lot about statistics but he definitely does not know how to organize its ideas. The book makes the subject appear much more complex than it really is. If you need to learn statistics are not a Statistics PhD student then what I really recommend you to do is to get another book. For MBA students: This book is way more complex than you will need to know for your studies.</span>

                    <span>It's hard to believe that a Wharton professor produced this book but I guess it's just proof that no school is perfect.  I'm sure the authors understand statistical analysis but they have no clue how to organize the material or communicate what they know effectively.  Honestly, even if you have learned the concepts for a chapter through another source this book can be hard to follow.  <p>Want an example of the murky text?  Try this typical run-on sentence quoted directly from the book.  "In the same way, the normal random variable is an abstraction, because in theory any numerical value, negative as well as positive, is possible, and the probability histogram is a smooth, symmetric, bell-shaped curve."  Try stringing together 800 pages of similar prose and you have an idea what awaits you here.<p>I watched an entire class including the professor disown this book because it was useless.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this turkey if at all possible.</span>
