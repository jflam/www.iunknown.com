                <span id="Label1">James Krenov's delicate, lyrical cabinets have inspired a generation of wood craftsmen, as has his impassioned insistence that one do his very best work, no matter what. In this volume, first published in 1979, Krenov invites the reader into his workshop, where he shares his techniques and uncompromising approach to craftsmanship, along with thoughts about his work and its place in the world. Photo sequences show how Krenov composes a cabinet directly in the wood, without dimensioned drawings. He also discusses working with shop-sawn veneers, the technique of fitting curved doors, and the problems of accuracy and mistakes. The book concludes with a detailed exploration of three furniture projects: a curved showcase cabinet, a writing table with drawer, and a chess table.</span>

If you fail to follow directions from magazine articles in your shop, but complete something more than what you'd originally planned, than see how a "master" can that way.</span>

                    <span>I did not know what to expect when I ordered this book I was kind of hopeing for a technical how-to guide on building cabinets.Since I was building kitchen cabinets at the time I wanted some top quality ideas and guides to build them. This book is not a step by step guide. But let me say this... this book has inspired me. Dare I say it is a spiritual guide to working with wood coupled with some solid planning and designing words of wisdom. For me it inspired me to move away from the standard straight designs and work toward more artistic and flowing furniture. Just don't buy this book thinking it is a technical how-to book on building you standard square boxes; but buy this book if you desire to build heirlooms .</span>

                    <span>I uncarefully bought this book thinking I would enjoy it (I'm a beginner in cabinet making). <P>Actually, I felt almost discouraged. I felt so far away from what Krenov describes... What I mostly thought was:<P>1. I'll have to read this book when I know more about cabinet making, and I can probably read it a few more times...<P>2. I'll offer it to an Aikido friend of mine who will doubtlessly enjoy the philosophy that is behind Krenov's words.</span>

                    <span>Many years ago I read about James Krenov. I had asked my wife to get me this book for Christmas. At the time I was a carpenter and was discouraged. I found in him a man that stood by his ideals and purposes in life. Later I told my wife that someday I wanted to go to Sweden and find him. In the meantime he moved to the United States. I heard him speak at a conference. Afterward I asked him about summer studies. I had the privilege of studying for two summers at the school that he founded. <P>By reading this book and studying under his teaching, it absolutely changed the quality of my work and helped me to solve many problems in woodworking that I was unable to get answers to. This book helped me to gain the knowledge that few have. Consequently it has paid back to me the satisfaction I have in the work I do and also in terms of financial payback.<P>This book should be required for every student and consumer. It is a book that will alert one to the pitfalls of poor design and construction.</span>

                    <span>First let me say that "The Impractical Cabinetmaker" is a fantastic book. Now let me say that this new one is a ripoff by the publisher. Let me explain. This "new" book is just a reprint of the orginal published in 1979 with a little more added to the title to make you think it's a new book. Nowhere does it say in the advertising for this book that it is a reprint of the orginal. If you don't have the orginal this is a must buy for any James Krenov fan.</span>
