                <span id="Label1">One of America's most respected diplomats on a life spent serving in the Far East.<P> James Lilley's life and family have been entwined with China's fate since his father moved to the country to work for Standard Oil in 1916. Lilley spent much of his childhood in China and after a Yale professor took him aside and suggested a career in intelligence, it became clear that he would spend his adult life returning to China again and again.<P> Lilley served for twenty-five years in the CIA in Laos, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taiwan before moving to the State Department in the early 1980s to begin a distinguished career as the U.S.'s top-ranking diplomat in Taiwan, ambassador to South Korea, and finally, ambassador to China. From helping Laotian insurgent forces assist the American efforts in Vietnam to his posting in Beijing during the Tiananmen Square crackdown, he was in a remarkable number of crucial places during challenging times as he spent his life tending to America's interests in Asia. In <I>China Hands</I>, he includes three generations of stories from an American family in the Far East, all of them absorbing, some of them exciting, and one, the loss of Lilley's much loved and admired brother, Frank, unremittingly tragic.<P> <I>China Hands</I> is a fascinating memoir of America in Asia, Asia itself, and one especially capable American's personal history.</span>

                    <span><P><BR>Lilley was born in Tsingtao, China, on the Shandong peninsula. He uses the old English spelling, rather than the new one, which the Chinese, who speak their own tongue and use characters instead of our alphabet, have instructed us to use today: Qingdao. I spent the entire year of 1948 in Tsingtao. That spelling is closer to the natives' pronunciation: Ching-taw. How they arrive at that from Qingdao is a mystery to me. Perhaps, in time, we will tell them what characters in their calligraphy they should use to "spell" our cities.<P><P>Lilley was the son of a Standard Oil Company of New York (SOCONY) salesman, selling "oil for the lamps of China". He attended College at Yale, where he was recruited into the CIA, and later into the State Department. He has been posted to Laos, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Taiwan, mostly as an agent of the CIA. He has been ambassador to China, as well. When he was a young man, he did not speak Chinese. He was raised, as were most foreign people in China, in a sequestered situation--usually a walled compound with broken glass on top of the wall for security. I've been in similar compounds. The Mandarin dialect spoken in Tsingtao by foreigners, including servicemen, was pidgin English. Riding in rickshaws is about as close as most of us got to Chinese customs.<P><P>When I think of China, I think of scenes in the movie, The Sand Pebbles, a depiction of a Yangtse gunboat. Tsingtao, though, was more Westernized. They still sell a German beer made there, brewed by Chinese, now, but originally German: Tsingtao Beer. It is one of their leading exports.<P>Spending time in China--even a considerable amount of time--did not make us knowledgeable about their customs, as he points out. I saw much of the Chinese people in the year I spent there with the U.S. Marine Corps (I was in naval aviation). While I was fascinated with the people and their customs, I never felt that I knew them. I knew the Japanese better, though I spent the same amount of time there. They are more like we Westerners in many of their customs. The Chinese have more of a sing song cadence to their speech patterns. Japanese is easier to learn.<P><P>Lilley spends much of the first few chapters of his book describing his brother, Frank, who was manic-depressive (bi-polar), apparently. He committed suicide, a not uncommon result of that affliction, which frequently strikes the most intelligent, most promising among us. Two of my younger brothers met the same fate. I can sympathize.<P><P>My greatest problem with this book was no fault of the author. He simply was not in Tsingtao while I was there, and did not therefore discuss our chaotic conditions when the "Bahloo" (Communists) took over and kicked us out of the country. They told us our lease was up.<P><P>Since he was not there, he did not see the communist soldiers come onto the Marine Corps Air Facility from Tsang-Ko (a walled town bordering the air base), as I did, and shoot the Chinese employees we had just paid off with sugar and flour.<P><P>We were armed, but could not shoot back. It was not our war. It was the beginning of my hatred for communism.<P><P>There is much talk of how China "needed" the "Agrarian Reformers" (communists) in this book. His father was apparently of that opinion. I think Lilley was not. I hope not. Much of the actual events of that time, the ascendancy of Mao Tse-Tung and the rise of his power, as the result of the activities of our State Departments activities (through the person of John Service and others) led to our loss of presence in China. We were sold out, as in Yugoslavia, Cuba and a half-dozen other places where we backed other communists against people like General Draja Mikhailovitch of Yugoslavia whose Chetniks saved hundreds of our flyers who were shot down, and was executed by Josep Tito's Partisans, against the protests of people like Sen. Joseph McCarthy who has since been so reviled. And today the brainbwashed majority buy it!<P><P>Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<P></span>

                    <span>Lilley is an impressive man whose life took him to interesting places and important events. However, this book is probably most suitable for those with a serious, even scholarly, interest in modern Asian history or similar fields. Parts of the book on growing up in pre-WW II China, on service with the CIA in Laos during the war in Viet Nam (but no derring-do for you spy fans), on political events in Korea and China in the 1980's--all these will be of interest. One minor surprise for me was that Lilley, after spending his childhood in China, could only speak a little 'street Chinese' he learned from his 'ama' and had to actually learn the language in the US.<P>Unfortunately for me, between these parts are prolonged intervals of almost diary-like, detailed accounts of diplomatic dealings, meetings, memos, conversations, personal and family life, etc that markedly dulled the book for me. Also, as Lilley says, it is indeed a personal memoir, so there is a lot about his family and, most especially, his older brother who clearly had a huge and, unfortunately, saddening influence on him. So much so that much of the first section of the book centers around the remarkable but flawed brother rather than the author, who then returns to this topic several times later on, quoting repeatedly from the brother's letters and diaries.<P>If you are interested in foreign affairs, you'll like reading of the famous events the author witnessed, even played a role in, but I found that much of the book dragged through excessive detail that will bore all but serious diplomacy buffs. I respect the author's grief over his beloved brother but found it much too personal for my own enjoyment.</span>

                    <span>Ambassador Jim Lilley is one of a very small set of children who grew up in pre-Mao China. Unlike most of them who were missionary kids, Lilley was the son of a prominent businessman. Those tumultuous early years formed the moral core of his character which served him in excellent stead throughout his adult career. Throughout a life that spanned revolution, war and terror, Jim Lilley has remained faithful to his ideals, his country and his family. This book reflects the extraordinary breath and depth of his experience, always filtered through his confidence of knowing what was the proper thing to do in situations that were often confusing and challenging.<BR>Jim Lilley always drew the tough assignments. He served during the fractious days of war in Indochina while a CIA employee, under the intense limelight of the Seoul Olympics, through a painful democratization process in South Korea, and during the brutality of the Tienamin Square crackdown by Chinese forces. Regardless of the challenges he has always represented himself and his country faithfully and well. He was a cerebral and consummate diplomat and a tough, loyal soldier. His deeds shine from the pages despite the self-effacing tone with which he writes.<BR>This book is a great read. Whether you are a student of Asia or simply trying to get your arms around a difficult but most critical area of the world, you need to have Lilley's book. It is written with style and grace, and includes drama, tragedy and humor. This is a book you will want to keep on your shelf and recommend to friends. Buy it today; you'll be glad you did.</span>
