                <span id="Label1">The greatest trilogy in film history, presented in the most ambitious sets in DVD history, comes to a grand conclusion with the extended edition of <I>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</I>.  Not only is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien the longest of the three, but a full 50 minutes of new material pushes the running time to a whopping 4 hours and 10 minutes.  The new scenes are welcome, and the bonus features maintain the high bar set by the first two films, <I>The Fellowship of the Ring</I> and <I>The Two Towers</I>.<p>  <B>What's New?</B><br> <table align=left   cellpadding="5"                                 <tr>                                 <td> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/aplus/lotr/rotk-saruman-2.jpg" border=0  align=top></td></tr></table> One of the scenes cut from the theatrical release but included here, the resolution of the Saruman storyline, generated a lot of publicity when the movie opened, as actor Christopher Lee complained in the press about losing his only appearance.  It's an excellent scene, one Jackson calls "pure Tolkien," and provides better context for Pippin to find the wizard's palantir in the water, but it's not critical to the film.  In fact, "valuable but not critical" might sum up the <I>ROTK</I> extended edition.  It's evident that Jackson made the right cuts for the theatrical run, but the extra material provides depth and ties up a number of loose ends, and for those sorry to see the trilogy end (and who isn't?) it's a welcome chance to spend another hour in Middle-earth. Some choice moments are Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) confrontation with the Witch King (we find out what happened to the wizard's staff), the chilling Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor, and Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) being mistaken for Orc soldiers.  We get to see more of &#201;owyn (Miranda Otto), both with Aragorn and on the battlefield, even fighting the hideously deformed Orc lieutenant, Gothmog. We also see her in one of the most anticipated new scenes, the Houses of Healing after the battle of the Pelennor Fields.  It doesn't present Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) as a savior as the book did, but it shows the initial meeting between &#201;owyn and Faramir (David Wenham), a relationship that received only a meaningful glance in the theatrical cut.  <p>  <table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=3 width=155 align="right"> <tr> <td><hr noshade size=1> <font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="336600"> <b> If you want to completely immerse yourself in Peter Jackson's marvelous and massive achievement, only the extended edition will do.</b> <br> </font> <hr noshade size=1></td> </tr> </table> And for those who complained, no, there are no new endings, not even the scouring of the Shire, which many fans were hoping to see.  Nor is there a scene of Denethor (John Noble) with the palantir, which would have better explained both his foresight and his madness.  As Jackson notes, when cuts are made, the secondary characters are the first to go, so there is a new scene of Aragorn finding the palantir in Denethor's robes.  Another big difference is Aragorn's confrontation with the King of the Dead.  In the theatrical version, we didn't know whether the King had accepted Aragorn's offer when the pirate ships pulled into the harbor; here Jackson assumes that viewers have already experienced that tension, and instead has the army of the dead join the battle in an earlier scene (an extended cameo for Jackson). One can debate which is more effective, but that's why the film is available in both versions.  If you feel like watching the relatively shorter version you saw in the theaters, you can.  If you want to completely immerse yourself in Peter Jackson's marvelous and massive achievement, only the extended edition will do.<p>  <B>How Are the Bonus Features?</B><br> <table align=left   cellpadding="5"                                 <tr>                                 <td> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/dvd/aplus/lotr/rotk-aragorn.jpg" border=0  align=top></td></tr></table> To complete the experience, <I>The Return of the King</I> provides the same sprawling set of features as the previous extended editions: four commentary tracks, sharp picture and thrilling sound, and two discs of excellent documentary material far superior to the recycled material in the theatrical edition.  Those who have listened to the seven hours of commentary for the first two extended editions may wonder if they need to hear more, but there was no commentary for the earlier <I>ROTK</I> DVD, so it's still entertaining to hear him break down the film (he says the beacon scene is one of his favorites), discuss differences from the book, point out cameos, and poke fun at himself and the extended-edition concept ("So this is the complete full strangulation, never seen before, here exclusively on DVD!"). The documentaries (some lasting 30 minutes or longer) are of their usual outstanding quality, and there's a riveting storyboard/animatic sequence of the climactic scene, which includes a one-on-one battle between Aragorn and Sauron. <p>  <B>One DVD Set to Rule Them All</B><br> Peter Jackson's trilogy has set the standard for fantasy films by adapting the Holy Grail of fantasy stories with a combination of fidelity to the original source and his own vision, supplemented by outstanding writing, near-perfect casting, glorious special effects, and evocative New Zealand locales.  The extended editions without exception have set the standard for the DVD medium by providing a richer film experience that pulls the three films together and further embraces Tolkien's world, a reference-quality home theater experience, and generous, intelligent, and engrossing bonus features.  <I>--David Horiuchi</I></span>

                    <span>Not sure why there's such a vacuum of information available here on ROTK- the platinum extended edition release.<P>Its no secret that Peter Jackson has finished the version - and that it contains a whopping 65 minutes of additional footage that was cut from the theatrical version, putting the final movie at four hours and ten minutes. Awesome!<P>Apparently there was some rumor that New Line Cinema was going to cheap out on the special effects for the extended release version - and go with a cut-rate American outfit instead of the New Zealand firm they've worked with on the prior two films - but this was just that - a rumor, as far as I've been able to obtain.<P>New Scenes from the book to appear in the extended release version include the following: Confrontation with Saruman at Isengaard in which the Palantir is acquired (tossed out tower by Wormtongue), Parley with the Mouth of Sauron outside the Black Gates, Merry pledging his swoord and allegiance to Theoden, Sam and Frodo, disguised in Orc garb, marching with (and then escaping from) Orc Troop in Mordor, Eowyn and Faramir meet in the Houses of Healing in Gondor, and finally, a scene in which Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron in the Palantir.<P>All in all, good stuff. The only liberty it sounds Jackson has taken with the material is that Saruman is killed in the confrontation at Isengaard - falls to his death from the tower - rather than simply cast from the order, stripped of his power and humiliated by Gandolph, as the book. We can certainly live with that, can't we?</span>

                    <span>It's interesting how the ultimate movie fan reviewed LOTR:ROTK as if Peter Jackson wrote the story. Yeah, he wrote the screenplay, and he did change quite a bit to make it more dramatic for the silver screen, but this story was written 60 years before Jackson started developing it for the screen. And as much as I love the books (I've read them a couple dozen times), I gotta tell ya, Jackson made some great changes. I did think that the Battle of Helm's Deep in LOTR:TTT went on a bit long, but his addition of the elves added depth and tragedy that the book did not have. Jackson fleshed out characters that Tolkien had left as two dimensional (such as Boromir) and made them even better. Aragorn became a lot more accessable and human, and Gandalf had humor and humanity. But the ending of the third movie was the ending of the third book, only more concise, dramatic, and emotional. Jackson did a fabulous job with this epic story. I don't think that anyone else could have done a better job. I can't wait for the extended release of The Return of the King.</span>

                    <span>These movies are the best I have seen. Even though some of the characters in the books are not in the films, it's still worth watching all three. I have read the books a few times and have seen the films like 15 times each. The extended editions are great because they fill in the blanks and answer questions that the cut versions leave. I love the LOTR trilogy, both the books and the films!</span>

                    <span>After reading these reviews, I can't believe that anyone could not give this movie 5 stars. Sure, it may have strayed from the book a little ... okay alot. But in the end, did that matter? The movie was beautifully shot, the fight scenes were amazing to say the least, the characters 3 dimensional and easy to relate to. I especially liked what he did with Smeagol/Gollum's character. In the book, he's presented as purely evil, while in the movie, we get to see that even though he's generally a spiteful and bitter little creature, he still retains some of his human elements as well. I felt that the actors portrayed the characters wonderfully. I thought Legolas was gorgeous (sorry, had to throw that in there). True, it deviates from the original storyline. However, I feel that Peter Jackson's changes did not alter the basic premise and outcome of the story -- good triumphing over evil. LOTR is by far the best movie of all time in my opinion. It would be great if Jackson shot a movie for The Silmarillion (another Tolkien book that gives the history of the formation of Middle-Earth and its inhabitants) but I think only diehard LOTR fans would be interested in that. So get this movie if u dont already have it!! Trust me, you wont be disappointed!!!</span>

                    <span>I think these films have done an EXCELLENT job of capturing the essence of Tolkien's writings. Once I read the Silmarillion I was completely drawn in. Vividly imaginitive and truly epic story-telling. The films stay true to these themes even with the changes done in the story! I really don't mind them. The Extended DVDs are a must for any fan of Tolkien! I'm anxious to get the third one! For me the Return of the King is THE best film ever made.</span>
