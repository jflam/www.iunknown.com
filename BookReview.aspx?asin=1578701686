                <span id="Label1">The authors of <I>Voice over IP Fundamentals</I>--three packet-voice specialists at Cisco Systems--initiate their exploration of next-generation technologies for supporting conversations across large distances: the switched telephone network as implemented on large (intercontinental) and small (building and enterprise) scales. They then point out problems with the old way of doing things and illuminate the standards and regulatory conditions that have made Internet telephony attractive. Signaling System 7 (SS7) gets particularly insightful coverage, with ample graphical support for the clear, fact-rich, example-laden prose.<p> The authors do a great service for readers by breaking packet telephony into its component technologies and explaining each one carefully. Coverage of the various protocols that enable voice over IP, particularly H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), is simultaneously clear and deep. The same goes for media gateway protocols and various schemes for translating sounds into digital signals and back again, while retaining maximum clarity. There's even some practical material; concluding chapters diagram Cisco router configurations for voice traffic and flesh out solutions with case studies.<p> You'll like this book if you need to implement a voice over IP system and know more about IP than you do about traditional voice telecommunications. The patient and detailed explanations of traditional telephony concepts and voice over IP protocols will mesh nicely with your existing data communications knowledge, enabling you to make wise design and product decisions. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Covered topics</B>: The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), signaling specifications (including Bell System, ISDN, and Signaling System 7), the basics of Internet Protocol (IP), modulation and compression of voice, Quality of Service (QoS), H.323, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and gateway protocols. Business considerations of Internet telephony are also addressed.</span>

                    <span>Although this book is but 15 chapters and 336 pages long it took me an incredible amount of time to read through it due to the complexity with which it was written.  I've read several Cisco Press books in the same time it took to read this one!  Further, I found myself asking the question over and over again, "If this book is about the fundamentals of Voice over IP and is 'A Systematic Approach to Understanding the Basics of Voice over IP', why is it difficult to grasp even the 'basics' as presented by the authors?"  As stated in a previous review, the authors have a great understanding of the topics, however, like my Theory of Operating Systems instructor, they do not do well in 'dumbing' down that information to me, a layperson in this field.  This book was definitely written by VoIP engineers for VoIP engineers, not for beginners like myself.</span>

                    <span>Strong Points: -The people who wrote it are definitely knowledgeable: They have loads of information about almost every topic they discuss   -Chapter organization: the chapters are well organized as far as the order in which to expose a reader to the topics, building up to the next.   Weak Points: -In almost every chapter, the author(s) frequently mention or compare the topic being discussed with an actual Cisco product.  While many people agree they make good products, including myself, this book should be about the VoIP as a standard (as the title implies), not Cisco's products.   -The author(s) explain most topics by throwing tons of (or too much) information at the reader, including exceptions to the rule - all in the same sentence.  Some of the key points are not even mentioned or elaborated on, while the author goes to point out small or insignificant details.   -While discussing the history of Telephony and VoIP technology, the use of acronyms is unavoidable, but the author(s) overuses them to the extreme.  At times, there are synonym acronyms that the author(s) will use randomly and interchangeably in the same chart, diagram or sentence; this is highly confusing.  Also, there is no glossary, so you have to waste time flipping back through the pages to look up acronyms they spelled out once.  Many acronyms are not even defined - they are just mentioned as casual talk to define other acronyms (so have your internet browser ready).   -The author(s) frequently define topics and acronyms sections or chapters after they are first mentioned.  This is also very confusing and frustrating.   -The book is filled with charts and graphs.  Most of them you really have to study to understand because they use many little pictures for which there is no legend, and some you flat our need an electrical engineering degree to understand.</span>

                    <span>I've had the Davidson book on the shelf for about a year and finally picked it up for a careful read to help me prepare of Cisco's CVOICE exam. While the book is useful toward that end, I recommend it only cautiously.<p>No doubt part of the problem is mine; by background includes extensive data but very little voice experience. I found the topic Signaling System 7 and similar topics to be slow reading, and I questioned the value of the IP tutorial. A reader with the inverse of my background may have exactly the opposite experience.<p>This book is unusually dense with acronyms, even for a technical book. The nature of the topic makes acronyms unavoidable, but I felt the lack of a glossary was a serious deficiency. I frequently found myself flipping back and forth through the book to decode an acronym to no avail. Thorough readers might want to construct their own glossary with index cards.<p>I also had the sense, especially toward the end of the book, that I was getting less of an explanation of the technology than a simple compendium of features. This was especially evident in those thin sections on the Session Initiation Protocol, the Simple Gateway Control Protocol, the Media Gateway Control Protocol, and the Virtual Switch Controller. I found the sections on the H.323 Protocols and Quality of Service more useful and complete.<p>Given the ambitious scope of the book, I believe the author could have provided a more readable and understandable treatment with six or seven hundred pages rather than the three hundred plus provided. Still, I find my understanding of the subject to have increased substantially. It is a fact that there are few alternatives. I give the book a qualified recommendation. Read it slowly and carefully, mastering acronyms as you go, to maximize its value.</span>

                    <span>This book is the one to read if you want to know something about the basics of Voice Over IP and the protocols which are involved like H.323. It also gives you an introduction to the POTS ( plain old telephony service ) standards. So, if you are new to VoIP and want to read about it from the ground, buy this.<p>But it is not the right choice if you are searching for preparation material for the cisco #640-647 cvoice exam. For that exam you also have to know something about VoFR and VoATM, which is not covered deeply enough here.</span>

                    <span>Fragmentation is necessary because of the time it takes to output bits in  large frames on slow serial links. This time is called serialization delay  and it is relevant for low-speed interfaces where delay-sensitive voice  packets might need to wait a long time while a long frame is pushed out the  interface, at say, 64 Kbps. Propagation delay is not the issue. This seems  like a very basic telecommunications 101 issue that the authors should not  have gotten wrong.</span>
