                    <span>I bought this book because I wanted a refresher on Molecular Biology. The first half of the text delivers this, explaining key concepts of DNA/RNA, the role of genes and the function of gene expression in the creation of proteins. Upon these understandings the author builds an explanation of genetic engineering. He explains techniques of recombinant DNA, the relevance of stem cells and modern gene therapy. The second half of the book was of less relevance to me, but if you need a journalist's eye view of the whole of biotech, sweeping across everything from cell biology to bioethics, Eric Grace does a reasonable job of providing it. Pro: Competently written and clearly illustrated. Con: Breadth but limited depth.</span>

                    <span>After seeing so much in the news about biotechnology, I was in search of an introductory book that would explain the basics of genetic manipulation. This book starts from the very basics--how are genes related to DNA and chromosomes, what are enzymes and proteins, then more sophisticated concepts such as gene splicing and monoclonal antibodies. <P>While this book won't make anyone an expert scientist, the text and diagrams are clear and concise. I read articles about biotech in the newspapers and business magazines, and this book is a useful primer for those in search of further detail. <P>After the overall introduction, the author describes biotech applications in several fields, which become a bit of a laundary list after awhile. I would have found fewer, in-depth case studies more interesting. Nevertheless, if you're looking for an informative introduction to biotech, I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>BIOTECHNOLOGY UNZIPPED is the most compelling evaluation of biotechnology I have read since Harsanyi & Hutton's GENETIC PROPHECY of almost 20 years ago. What makes this book so insightful is the "tradeoffs" perspective that Grace brings to the subject. In every instance where a particular technique is either in development or on the market, the possibilities for selective breeding, or genetic engineering, or composite materials, all hold both a promise and a peril.<P> Grace, who has a Ph.D. in Zoology and considerable experience as a science writer, attempts to provide enough critical information in each case so that the reader will get a sense of what considerations are involved in any particular "biotechnology solution". What we learn about biotechnology from him is that every biotechnology decision has the following characteristics:<P> * Costs and revenues (developments cost $millions, so the goal is profits) * Winners and losers (the rich could get lucky, the poor and vulnerable may not) * Benefits and detriments (solutions generate unintended & unwanted consequences) * Enthusiasts and detractors (arguments arise on all sides of biotechnology issues)<P> The reason that the public is so ambivalent about biotechnology is that its supporters have been so inept at making their case. Biotechnology advocates seem to think that their's is just a problem of an "uninformed public" whom they can re- assure because they have "the facts". They obviously don't appreciate the most important principle of new-age public relations, namely, "They don't care how much you know until they know how much you care".<P> What Grace shows is that the public does have cause to be concerned. There are no simple problems, no silver bullets, and no final solutions, even if biotechnology boosters pretend there are. If biotechnology advocates become willing to address these concerns, AND learn to manage the expectations of their stakeholders, then they can begin to earn the respect that will otherwise continue to elude them. Grace's book helps clarify all of this. Well done!</span>

                    <span>I bought and read this book for my biotechnology class and I really did not like it very much. There are certain parts that are understandable. But much of the book was just blah, blah, blah. If you have to take a class on biotechnology, or just want to read a biotechnology book, this fits you. If you really don't want to read these kind of books, I would not recommend it.</span>
