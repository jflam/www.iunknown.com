                <span id="Label1">"This book calls attention to the pressing issues of abandoned baby girls in China, the result of a combination of historical and cultural prejudices against women and the current draconian, one-child policy. <i>The Lost Daughters of China</i> is an evocative memoir that will not only attract parents or would-be parents of Chinese baby girls but will touch the hearts of us all."  <i>(Chicago Tribune)</i><br><br> Proclaimed an instant classic upon its hardcover publication, <i>The Lost Daughters of China</i> is at once compelling and informative. Journalist Karin Evans tells the story of adopting her daughter, Kelly, who was once one of the hundreds of thousands of infant girls who wait for parents in orphanages all over China. Weaving her personal account with extensive research, Evans investigates the conditions that have led to generations of abandoned Chinese girls and a legacy of lost women.<br><br>  With a new epilogue added for the paperback edition, this book will appeal to anyone interested in China and in the emotional ties that connect people regardless of genes or culture. In the words of bestselling novelist Amy Tan, <i>The Lost Daughters of China</i> is "not only an evocative memoir on East-West adoption but also a bridge to East-West understanding of human rights in China."</span>

                    <span>This informational book is recommended to anyone considering the adoption of a Chinese girl. The morals, ethics and emotions involved in such adoptions are illustrated by the author as she relates her experience with the process. Karin Evans addresses the questions that all adoptive parents have, and then brings to the fore many considerations that are unique to the adoption of abandoned girls from China. A good resource for those beginning to think about adopting in China. Recommended reading for adoptive parents of Chinese girls who are are preparing for their daughter's questions about their native land and the reasons behind their abandonment.</span>

                    <span>I was delightfully surpised by this book. I'm an aunt-to-be of a neice from China and have been looking for any information I can find for family members of adoptive parents. This book turned out to fit the bill perfectly. Evans beautifully interweaves her own story of her daughter's adoption with a broader, factual picture of international adoption from China. Although this is only one family's experience, it enlightened me on what my relatives will and are going through on their adoption journey. It also filled in many of the gaps in my knowledge of China's infamous "one child" policy and how this affects women and children's lives in China every day. It is chilling when Evans gives statistics on the number of China's daughters that have been lost. And yet at the same time you can not help but be filled with hope to read of the perfect matches between adoptive parents and their Chinese daughters. Evans approaches her subject with obvious thoughtfulness and care and you can't help but care right along with her. I recommend this book not only for adoptive parents but grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends of parents adopting from China.</span>

                    <span>Wow! Marvelously written. It is informative, thought provoking, insightful and stirring. Karin Evans has done a great service to all those who have or will adopt from China, their families and anyone interested in understanding or getting a glimpse of the situation in China that has led to these precious girls being abandoned and their hope for tomorrow.</span>

                    <span>Evans combines her personal journey that led her to adopt a girl from China with statistics and facts about why these girls are in orphanages in the first place. I disagree with many of the reviewers who say that this book is schmaltzy. It is one of those books that you just don't want to put down. We are in the midst of adopting from China and it was wonderful to read about Evan's experience. We have given this book to aunts and uncles of our soon to be daughter and everyone has been glad to have read it for they learned a lot. It dispelled a lot of myths that they had about China and adoption.</span>

                    <span>I commend Karin Evans for tackling this subject, and for sharing a deeply personal story with universal applications. I have often wondered how adopting families feel about benefitting from such an appalling situation. The author is honest about her ambivalence, but I felt frustrated that she cast the problem largely as a rural vs. urban dichotomy, where "progress" and "jobs" and "education" were offered as the answer to rural poverty and the backward ways of those poor farm folk. Perhaps this is China's solution, but it needn't be ours. North Americans buy vast amounts of goods made by China's sweat shops, so you can be sure that there are many more "red threads" tying us all together than simply those of love for an unknown child in a distant land. The author just barely scrapes the surface of our relationship with China, of our willingness to exploit their labour and their lives so that we have access to cheap goods. We need more dialogue on this whole issue: The Lost Daughters of China is a start.</span>
