                    <span>An excellent read from start to finish. Anasi's style jumps around a little bit (flashback, present, flash"sideways?"), but it adds to the flavor. I really felt a part of the scene. Also, Anasi's knowledge of the sport, and racial tensions, is deep. Opinionated, but deep. The ending could have been stronger - that's the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.</span>

<br />
<br />George Plimpton is quoted as having said that The Gloves "As good a book as any I've read about the sport" - not exactly a ringing endorsement and I was a little worried -
<br />
<br />This is actually a great book right from the start. 
<br />
<br />I was immediately hooked and addicted to his trainer's (Milton) style of fighting - something about the concept of Southpaw's just grabs me and especially a non-natural Southpaw - anyway that's what truly hooked me in.
<br />
<br />The story is true - and the experience of reading Anasi's practice and journey through the world of amateur boxing is so real and compelling that you just can't put the book down.
<br />
<br />The characters and people he meets and trains with are very interesting and he does such a great job in retelling his tale.
<br />
<br />There was a point where the book dragged a bit, but as a whole it's a great story.
<br />
<br />It's an impressive, exciting and honest look at amateur boxing, of amateur boxers and the sport of boxing in general.
<br />
<br />Great book - give it a read.

                    <span>"As both a writer and a boxer, Robert Anasi hears the fight game's music twice as loud.  The result: a soundtrack for the wounded and the healing; for the seasoned veteran and the baffled student.  With lilting precision Anasi captures the grace, the courage, and the madness of a boxer's everyday life.  In a time when Boxing Books written by Journalists, Novelists, and Academics are as common as bloody noses, "The Gloves" is unique in that it offers a reader rare insights and observations from the fighter's point of view.  Anasi's boxing skills may only allow him to compete at the amateur level, but as a writer he's gone straight to the pros."</span>

                    <span>Anasi is a writer first and a boxer second. None-the-less he is passionate about the sport and serious about his intent in learning the craft. Because he is a writer first, he provides insights and word-crafting that is not normally found in boxing literature. One either has boxers talking to writers that write about them, writers that never really boxed writing about boxing, or boxers that can't write trying to do so. This is not a book about training in boxing, but it is a book about the spirit of boxing and that it can grab you and hold you indefinitely. Anasi does a great job in providing first person insight into not only his dream's, but those of his stable-mates.</span>
