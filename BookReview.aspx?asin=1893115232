                <span id="Label1">Imagine, for a moment, a guy. This guy, about 40 years old, has worked  all of his life in a job that doesn't require much knowledge of computers,  certainly not of how to write software. Now, imagine that our guy decides to  change career paths and learn computer programming. He goes and buys a book  about a programming language, perhaps one that promotes itself as elementary.  The book presents our hapless guy with recipes that he can follow, it's true,  but mostly it confuses him with talk of APIs, linked lists, hashes, and a mess  of other stuff that he doesn't understand, really. "I can make it all work by  following directions," our guy implores into the Void. "But I don't understand  what I'm doing." This guy needs <I>How Computer Programming Works</I>.<p>  In this book, Daniel Appleman sets out to explain computer programming at a  conceptual level, and succeeds admirably. Appleman ignores the peculiar  characteristics of specific programming languages (leaving them for specialized  books), and instead uses fantastic color illustrations and lucid text to explain  what goes unsaid among professional programmers. He also uses pseudocode--a sort  of standardized, generic programming language--and examples in BASIC to back up  his points. Although Appleman approaches programming mainly from a procedural  angle (the book would be better with more coverage of object-oriented  programming techniques, which fundamentally are different, in many cases), the  contents of this book will suit any beginning student of programming and  computer science--our guy included. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Aspects of computer programming that you must  understand in order to write code, but that generally are not explained  conceptually in language-specific programming books <li>Variables <li>Loops  <li>Pointers <li>Arrays <li>Code blocks <li>Stacks <li>Trees <li>Other  fundamental building blocks <li>Critical algorithms, like the bubble sort  <li>Getting from specification to finished product <li>Network programming</ul></span>

                    <span>Not when the illustrations are as poorly drawn and pointless as these. eg people staring at computers, sweeping arrows with colored blends, or pointing hands (proving, yes they are hard to draw!). I can however follow the reasoning. 
<br />
<br />This is yet another programmer who has trouble explaining the jargon but has noticed books that do a good job of being user friendly, have pictures. I found this book to be just like those inane PowerPoint presentations that middle executives think expresses the right side of their brain. A right side that seems to be made of cheap PC clip art.
<br />
<br />It doesn't help every time the book gets to a core idea, that it glosses over it as if it is obvious, without explaining the detail. Nor that on top of the meaningless graphics, the book is full of DTP blunders that obviously nobody has checked. Such as text set in fonts with mismatching encodings, resulting in strange accented characters being substituted for whatever the author intended.
<br />
<br />Why do programmers have such difficulty producing clear, sequential, logical and carefully crafted expression, that has been checked for errors? 
<br />
<br />I thought that was their job.</span>

                    <span>A good book does not need to be complex. This one does a great job. You could read this book during one hour and learn more than in one semester of COS111. It is so simple. Comcepts are the most important thing to learn. They give meaning to programing. Without concepts, programing becomes meaningless.</span>

                    <span>This book explains the "magic" of computer programming as  clearly as can be done. Outstanding use of graphics to illustrate difficult  concepts. Concrete analogies to "real world" objects make the  virtual world of programming much easier to wrap your mind around.  <p>Outstanding introduction for middle-school, high school, even beginning  college level students. Very clearly written, not a lot of unnecessary  words - just the right level of explanation to get you thinking in the  right direction and to see what the graphics are illustrating. My 13-year  old loved it, and finally understands a bit more of what his Dad does all  day. I've been doing this for 15 years -- and even I got a better grasp of  some things.<p>Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>this book is a fine introduction to computing.  imagine a book with cogent, well-illustrated explanations of topics like (1) what a variable is  (2) linked lists (3) pointers....<p>...that also discussed the plusses and  minusses of various computer languages....<p>...and that was useful to a  professional programmer, and entertaining for his 13-year-old kid.<p>that's  this book.  i occasionally teach introductory programming classes, and i've  used this book as a source of handouts and overheads (within the bounds of  "fair use" and the copyright laws, of course.  :-) )  in my early  days as a developer, i also pulled it off of the shelf more than once when  i needed a quick graphical metaphor for something that i was trying to  understand.</span>
