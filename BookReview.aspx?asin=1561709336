                    <span>When I first read Power Vs. Force I found that a book could open up whole new worlds, not imaginary worlds or worlds of escape, but worlds to help see reality, discover the truth and further advance along the path of spiritual enlightenment and/or salvation. I love the book and was very excited about the practical applications of the science that the book is all about: Kinesiology. This book made me hungry for more books that could potentially nourish my soul and open my self to well-meant advice that authors like David R. Hawkins feel inspired to give through intelligent, carefully thought out dissertations, but then something happened. As I began to feel interest for "self-help" topics thanks to the doors Power Vs. Force opened up for me, I discovered books that were even better. I used to read only novels, only make-believe, which is entertaining and always has some degree of truth, since its source is human, but nevertheless often does not have a practical application in daily life or has one or several that are so hidden, it takes time to discover them. Power Vs. Force pointed me in another direction. So now, comparatively, Power Vs. Force has lost footing in my top ten list, although it's still in there. And that is why I only rate it 4 stars, because my grading curve has broadened since I first read it, constantly expanding as I go on to "bigger and better things"... </span>

                    <span>I try to read a lot of book as I am in management and I'm always looking for a way to improve my skills.  I found this book to be very interesting and thought provoking.  The "test" that David talks about is extremely powerful and very useful.  Some interesting concepts are in this book that are not in a more traditional management book.  I found the first few chapters difficult to digest, but the rest was worth the initial strain.  Would recommend...</span>

<br />Interesting...
<br />
<br />Well.  There are two or three ways I could tentatively address Hawkins' major preemptive issues here.  And he has a lot of them; some of which could be interpreted as being mildly juxtaposed.  Let me begin by presenting my initial thoughts regarding his primary theories:
<br />
<br />Approaching the subject matter somewhat selectively, speaking as a NASA theoretical physicist and working with just the raw data, and taking into account his historical point of view (post WW II/Cold War) - I personally think that Hawkins' whole book was likely meant to be sort of a precursor Nietchieistick reference to how Krechner's [elusive though none too widely used] Theorem is sometimes a good filler idiom when no other tack really - or at least readily comes to mind.  The manner in which Hawkins hierarchically quantifies most of this in relation to Chopra's treatise on the quantum mechanical body is nevertheless acceptable.  This is no myth.  The "power" couplet [or as is more precisely used, word - noting of course, that most (65 to 85%) autistic genius is generally arrived at by hammering home this very principal] was rather, I think, a Jungian parody on how sometimes, in most Gordian test cases, as the subject approaches nil, the subconscious mind tends towards experiences of childhood (or adulthood) behavior, during which time the renal cropping of the Id fuses natally, or rather, the "boomerang effect" comes close to what most experts agree is the process most often times recognized as the catalyst of choice during certain post-operative future tentative salmon angioplasties - normally. This naturally being the standardized subjunctive issue in most broad-based test cases.  See Ethics in Government Psychological Operations Act, Title VI, P. L. 95-521, 92 Stat. 1952, as amended).
<br />
<br />Now, on the other hand, after reading Hawkins' book yet a third time, I am ruthlessly reminded of a story a former associate in the NSA confidentially shared with me several nerve-wracking weeks after the free world was assaulted with the "We will bury you" speech by the late Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.  Allow me to briefly elaborate...
<br />
<br />One sunny afternoon around 2:00pm, Promisebee, the much loved shiny violet humming-bird was chatting with her friend, a 320 lb. wharf rat known in the area as "Munchausen" Eddie and his brother Petrov - a 30 foot Australian crocodile out on prison work-release.  When suddenly and without warning, Promisebee noticed that Brian was standing nearby behind a telephone pole, drooling and staring lucidly.  Realizing the jig was up and that her protective coloring was totally useless, she jumped off a cliff, quickly dying of fatally self-inflicted fall wounds.  At which point Eddie, knowing the police would be arriving soon, and stricken with a bewilderingly complex onslaught of uncontrolled dementia, bit himself and then commenced to put the crocodile in a sloppily executed, yet deadly strangle-hold as Brian stood motionless, smiling quietly to himself.
<br />
<br />These are my initial thoughts regarding Hawkins' primarily more selective issues.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Mystics have taught for centuries that certain thoughts or attitudes are empowering while others are destructive. Until Hawkins wrote this book, however, no one had attempted to measure these positive or negative effects. Using kinesiology, Hawkins has produced a detailed scale of consciousness ranging from 0 to 1000, with 200 the tipping point where one crosses from force (negative) to power (positive). 
<br />
<br />The ramifications are apparent in today's world. Your intuition may tell you the "Power of Pride" is not contributing to a better world. You may recall that pride is one of the seven deadly sins. Hawkins quantifies this-he has calibrated pride at 175, which is destructive.
<br />
<br />Hawkins map of consciousness is a tremendous resource, but I also appreciated his description of his prolonged "mystical experience." That by itself was worth the price of the book.

                    <span>This is a great book to help understand what it is going to take to have "Man Kind" move beyond, war, fear, greed and all the other things preventing all Human Beings from being happy and healthy. A big part of this is beginning with yourself and shifting your own thinking to "be the change you want to see in the world".
<br />
<br />This book will also impact your business, your personal life, your relationships and give you a simple tool to help you make choices and decisions with ease. This is one of my top 20 favorite books.
<br />
<br />And another great book to help you be the change you want to see and free you from the limitations and constraints shackled to you buy your body is The Creator's Manual for Your Body.
<br />
<br />Enjoy your freedom.</span>
