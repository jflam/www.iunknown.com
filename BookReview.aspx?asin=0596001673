                <span id="Label1">When I decided to take the dynamic language "red pill" in late 2004, I spent quite a bit of time looking around for books. Martelli and Ascher's Python Cookbook is by far the best of the lot. I use this in conjunction with Martelli's other book, Python in a Nutshell. 
<br><br>The first chapter is absolutely invaluable. If you're new to Python, and coming at it with the mindset of a statically typed developer, this chapter will give you a heavy dose of "pythonic" programming style. Some recipes like "Swapping Values Without Using a Temporary Variable" show off some of the really elegant features of the language. Other recipes like "Collecting a Bunch of Named Items" absolutely changed the way I looked at the language.
<br><br>Chapter 5 on Object-Oriented Programming is also a must-read. Python doesn't behave like C# or Java - and it's important to understand how its object model is implemented. While calling a superclass method in C# or Java may seem straightforward, the built-in super function doesn't behave like you would expect in Python- this is why you must read the "Calling a Superclass Implementation of a Method" recipe.
<br><br>Chapters 3 and 4 cover the bread and butter of much of the Python programming that I currently do: processing text files and file I/O.
<br><br>The rest of the book deals with various topics that you will read as you encounter the need:
<br><br>* Searching and Sorting
* Threads, Processes and Synchronization
* System Administration
* Database and persistence
* UIs
* Network Programming
* Web Programming
* XML processing
* XML-RPC / SOAP
* Debugging
* Metaprogramming
* C library extensions
* Algorithms</span>

                    <span>This book nicely complements "Learning Python" by giving the reader a wide exposure to how Python can be used to solve common problems.  The text is more than a list of recipes.  A discussion section follows each code snippet.  This is useful since the code is actually explained as opposed to simply being listed.  The book is well laid out and has a decent amount of white space in the margins for notes.  A more exhaustive index would have made finding a particular example easier, although having said that, the Table of Contents is well laid out.  I highly recommend "Python Cookbook" not only as a book to show how specific problems can be solved using Python, but as showing alternative approach.</span>

                    <span>This book is based on ActiveState on-line library of python recipes which were selected and edited by two well known experts, industry veteran Alex Martelli and David Ascher, with the help from other Python experts. <br>Recipes are organized in seventeen chapters. Chapters begin with short introduction on the topic covered, and is well worth the reading alone (even if you're primarily interested on a specific recipe take the time and read the introduction text). Each recipe is comprised of four sections: Problem definition -> Solution (code) -> Discussion -> Pointers to other relevant recipes or material. <br>No matter how proficient you're at coding in Python you'll certainly found some useful tips, new approaches or coding techniques. Usually technical books have strong and weak parts which I point out in my reviews, this one is different. As someone before me stated, this book is all meat and no fat. What else do you want from your diet?</span>

                    <span>This is one of those rare books that is all meat and no fat.  It is a wonderful collection of relevant and useful solutions for many programming problems that you will face, and many that you probably just figured were too hard to solve.  It is clearly laid out, so finding a needed solution is easy.  <p>One of the most powerful benefits of owning this book is astonishing amount of knowledge you can pick up by browsing it.  With almost every recipe I discovered either a new approach to doing something with Python, that was far more elegant than what I would have thought of, or something that I didn't even consider was possible.  It covers a vast array of important topics, from text processing, threads, object-oriented programming, and much more.<p>In short buy this book, grab a drink, and have a nice long sit-down session with it.  You'll love every page of it.</span>

                    <span>With this kind of book, there is a danger of just reproducing in print a set of libraries that might have been more conveniently downloaded from a code repository. The "Python Cookbook" succeeds by concentrating on those idioms and techniques that can often be woven into various programs; in addition the accompanying commentaries usually do an excellent job of leaving the reader with a better understanding of the relevant issues. The value of the book is increased further by the well-written chapter introductions, which often yield deep insights into the Python way of doing things.</span>

                    <span>Of the many successes of Python, this is the least known but one of the most impressive: it has gained the affection and the respect of a hard guy like Alex Martelli. That is not an easy task for a small, interpreted programming language like Python.<p>When I first met Alex Martelli, at Think3, he was one of the oldest and most experienced programmers of the company, a programmer who had already used most of the existing languages and had used these languages for the development of large and complex applications, the kind of projects that took months or years to complete. He knew Perl very, _very_ well and was used to rely on a robust, elegant and sophisticated language like C++ for the development of his applications (like Think3's Thinkdesign, a very complex 3D CAD program). He was writing a _lot_ of software, using a large array of different languages and tools. He was a well respected internal consultant at Think3, charged to solve difficult problems related to the software architecture of the program being developed. He was not an easy guy to impress with "yet another small language".<p>Despite this, Python has gained some room in his heart. I consider this fact as one of the most significant success of this elegant and powerfull language. To be completely honest, I'm not completely surprised by this ending.<p>Alex Martelli is the kind of scientist and professional that appreciate elegance, wherever he can see it. The taste for elegance, the ability to take pleasure in elegance, is an important part of the scientist and engineer personality. It is hard to be a really good software professional without having any kind of interest for elegance. When you need a simple tool that can face complex problems, you are asking for elegance. When you need a language that leave you with maintenable code, you are asking for elegance. When you want a single language for a wide array of applications, you are asking for elegance. Python can supply you with all the elegance you can ever ask for.<p>Alex's and David's book is a collection of good techniques that you can use to face a large set of problems with Python, from text transformation to GUI building to OpenGL grahics. You will not find here an introductory book, rather you will find a good second-reading book, the kind of book that can take you from the beginner level to the advanced. It is also the kind of book that can widen your knowledge of the Python world, showing you how this modern language can easily deal with problems that you usually face with C++ or the like.<p>If you are looking for an introductory book, buy "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz and David Ascher: it is the best one for this task. If you already know Python, buy this book and see how much you still do not know about it.</span>
