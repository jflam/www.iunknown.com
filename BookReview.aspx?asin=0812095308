                    <span>You are an ESL student or a non-native speaker of English?<p>You want to improve your American English vocabulary?<p>You also want to avoid the verbose academic methods?<p>Stop here! You get it!<p>I've just finished  "504..." today and frankly, I'm fully satisfied. Murray, Julius  and Arthur have set up a very intuitive and captivating course: a set of 42  lessons cut up in 7 sessions, each session separated by a review.<p>How  does a typical lesson work?<p>You have a list of 12 words in a yellow  vignette, so you can see what you're gonna learn in a quick glance. The  details appear on the right: for each of the words, you have: their  standard pronunciation(s) (essential!), their definition(s) and 3 examples  of common use. After that, a short article using all of them is presented.  The coolest thing is you often meet in the example sentences and articles  the words you learnt before. It's a good way to practice them again and  test your learning. And you know what? Some articles can even teach you  many things beyond English!<p>Then come 3 exercises. Two are repeated over  the lessons: you have 12 sentences with blanks and you fill them in with  one of the words. The second standard exercise is an illustration and you  are encouraged to find which of the words is hidden behind. <p>The 3rd  exercise varies, depending on the lesson. You can expect one of these: <p>*  Make up your own 12 sentences,<p>* Find synonyms or antonyms,<p>* Find the  words from their definition,<p>* Find among 12 phrases those which don't  make sense.<p>Each lesson should not take you more than an hour, maybe even  less. Besides, it happened from time to time that 1/2 hour was sufficient  for me.<p>"Okay", I heard you say, "but I'm still not  convinced. How did you do in practice?"<p>Well, generally, I tried to  follow 5 lessons a week, i.e one after my workday. <p>I looked at the new  words I had to learn and checked the pronunciation. I repeated each word 10  times aloud, even if I didn't know what it meant. Afterwards, I repeated  all the list up and down as many times as needed (between 3 and 5 times)  for my pronunciation to be a reflex. I didn't want to take bad habits of  pronunciation by reading the definition first and realize half a minute  later that my mouth and my tongue hadn't done their job correctly, you see.  A word is like a girl's name. She likes to hear her name pronounced  correctly. When a boy meet a damsel for the first time and plans to keep in  touch with her, he longs to know her name and he'll carefully use it the  next time. I think it's the same for a word. Try to be nice to it and name  it correctly before living with it. You should do this for *all* the words:  if pologamy is illegal, polywordy isn't ;)<p>So, as soon as I was at ease  with the pronunciation, I read the examples *before* the definition. Why?  Because I wanted to guess the meaning: I had noticed that a word is all the  better memorized as you feel you already know it somehow. Finally, to check  my guess, I read the definition and went to the next word. I repeated the  process twice, just to be sure. Of course, the 2nd time was faster. Then, I  did the exercises.<p>What if I already knew some of the words? In fact, out  of these 504 essential words, I already knew 1/3 of them but I don't regret  anything because I saw a great number of them used in contexts I would  never have suspected :), so I felt richer anyway.<p>About the exercises, I  told you you were asked sometimes to create your own 12 sentences. I  confess I happened to find it not challenging enough. In that case, instead  of 12 independant phrases, I wrote a little story using the 12 words, like  in the article. It's a good way to develop their loyalty and challenge your  creativity.<p>But it isn't the end yet! In case you'd be still afraid not  to be trained enough, the 7 reviews in the yellow pages are here to  reassure you. They are organized somewhat differently compared to the  lessons.<p>Each review contains 7 exercises:<p>1) Choose the good word in  phrases between two suggestions,<p>2) Find opposites,<p>3) Rebuild  newspaper headlines,<p>4) Find words from their definitions,<p>5) Complete  a letter with words from a list,<p>6) Find analogies,<p>7) Make sentences  with words that do double-duty.<p>Of course, you'll find again the words of  the immediately previous lessons but also a few more from even farther  ones.<p>The exercise on analogies is tough sometimes, that's really my  opinion. Words that do double-duty are very exciting because you learn that  some words you have been taught as verbs for instance can also be  considered as nouns or adjectives.<p>I needed 3 months to complete the  method and I enjoyed it like a little kid.<p>So, if I convinced you, enjoy  it too! :))</span>

                    <span>I use this book to teach school children and working adults and I find it a good book to use. There are 12 words to be learnt in each lesson with many examples to show how these words are used in sentences and stories.   There are also exercises for the learners to practise using these words  either in constructing sentences, filling in the blank, matching, etc....</span>
