                    <span>This is one of those books you always want to re-read. I found the story so fantastic that I actually decided to search out "Burningbush" golf club when I studied abroad in Scotland. Michael Murphy recounts a story so wonderfully mystical, that only players with the proper vision, depth, and a love for the game will appriciate it. If you don't play, don't buy. If you love the game and think you understand it, you'll love this book.</span>

                    <span>Many people ask why we play golf. This book helps explain it. It shows that golf is not only a game, but a science, love and religon. Reading about that 1 night that Shivas played golf, will forever last in my mind. This is a must read for people that enjoy playing golf for the inner love and complexities.</span>

                    <span>I don't care how many times I read this book, I always walk away with something new. If you enjoy philosophy in a modern context without going to "new-age", this is a great book. I would also recommend Life of Pi.</span>

                    <span>First of all, brothers and sisters, this is just a pack of lies, he made it all up, it's a work of fiction. I think the author even admitted it later. It was the fad when this thing was written for hippie-dippies like Murphy or Carlos Castaneda to do this kind of thing, hoodwink the public and sell a zillion books. It worked then and it works now. Don't be a sucker.<P>Second of all, brothers and sisters, the Esalen institute drivel that Murphy and his ilk have been promoting for decades is transparently a load of hogwash. If you want real mysticism, read Krishnamurti or Gurdjieff. (And do be aware that this book only uses golf as a mouthpiece for outdated sixties-era pseudo-mystical junk.)<P>Third of all, brothers and sisters, golf has nothing to do with spirituality. Golf is an excuse for potbellied old rich guys to pretend they are athletes, while destroying about a hundred acres of nature in the process, and then pumping the groundwater full of poisons to kill all the bugs and the weeds they don't like to see on their little golf courses -- which is what they think of "natural beauty". If an evil sport ever existed, golf is it. It ranks up there with feeding Christians to the lions.<P>In other words, golf is a waste of time, this book is a waste of time, and you should find better things to do.</span>

                    <span>As a scratch golfer and a Christian, I was very disappointed with both of this acclaimed book's topics: golfing and spirituality. The first half of the book is fairly interesting, painting some of the joys and lows of golf in clear pictures. Murphy does a nice job describing the inner struggles inherent in all serious golfers, regardless of talent. The second half of the book, however, is a thinly veiled sales pitch for seemingly every convoluted spiritual theory ever invented by mankind. The whole spiritual sink is thrown in, and as such, it is muddy and depressing. Ease up on the whiskey, Shivas! <P>Some quick advice: want to make a huge breakthrough with the spiritual/mental aspect of golf? Read "Golf is Not a Game of Perfect," by Dr. Bob Rotella, and practice. Want to read about the inner battles we all fight on the course, written so tangibly you can taste it? Read "A Good Walk Spoiled" by John Feinstein. Want to find the Truth and have a life changing spiritual awakening? Read the Bible (the Gospel of John first, Romans second, anything else next), and practice! <P>Happy golfing, and happy reading! The Truth is simple, and It will set you free!</span>
