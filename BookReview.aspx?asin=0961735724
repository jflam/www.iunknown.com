                    <span>I read this book in 1964 as a 4th grader in Northern California learning state history.  I have never forgotten Patty or her doll (which used to be on display at Sutter's Fort).  When my children were small it was not in print and I am so happy to see it is again.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about American history from a totally different perspective.  That of a little wooden doll, chosen amongst many beautiful sisters, to make a rough trip in the pocket of her owner.  You will never forget Patty Reed, or her doll, I know I haven't.  I am buying the book to keep to read and to my grandchildren.</span>

                    <span>Patty Reed's Doll is an excellent account of the Donner Party and all the other families that were part of the Donner Tragedy.The book describes the families in such detail you feel like you're traveling with them.  The  Reeds are one of the families that are traveling with the Donner Party. The  story is an excellent way to teach elementary school children as well as  adults what trailblazing was really like and the severe hardships that went  with it.  As an elementary school teacher I highly recommend this book.  It  is an asset to studying California history.</span>

                    <span>I'm an 8th grader and recently we've been learning all about the westward movement in the mid-1800's.  Now, I haven't been read TO since about third grade, but our school librarian has been coming in to my history class and  reading Patty Reed's Doll to us.  I loved the story, and reccommend it to  people of all ages.  It was very educational, too, because it made me  realize how hard the journey must have been.  It made me feel like I was  traveling with the Donner party across America.  If you're looking for a  good historical fiction, I suggest you try this book. IT'S THE BEST!!! :-)</span>
