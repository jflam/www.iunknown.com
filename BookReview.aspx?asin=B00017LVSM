                <span id="Label1">What do you get when you cross the Crocodile Hunter with the <I>Jurassic Park</I> trilogy? You get <I>Chased by Dinosaurs</I>, an awesomely entertaining BBC follow-up to the phenomenally successful <I>Walking with Dinosaurs</I> programs. Hosted by zoologist-adventurer Nigel Marven, this compilation of playfully exciting 30-minute programs is a time traveler's dream come true, presenting a feast of impressive prehistoric scenery as if it were readily accessible to any present-day camera crew. It's digital fakery at its finest, and Marven's infectious enthusiasm combines up-to-date research with wide-eyed intensity as he introduces us to a wide-ranging menagerie of long-extinct species, thriving in their native habitats and raging from 75 to 450 million years B.C. "Land of Giants" leaps back to the early Cretaceous period (100 million B.C.) to what is now Argentina, where Marven and his intrepid crew find Argentinosaurus, at over 100 feet long the largest dinosaur ever. Other marvels abound, including an Ultralight flight among a flock of Pteranodons, with wingspans up to 40 feet! "The Giant Claw" is a search for Therizinosaurus, an amazing herbivore (Mongolia, 75 million B.C.) with enormous 28-inch claws on 10-foot arms. The three-part "Sea Monsters" spans seven epochs to survey some of the most bizarre and terrifying creatures that ever swam the oceans, including sea scorpions, a multi-tentacled Giant Orthocone, and Megalodon, the ancient relative to Great White Sharks. And that's just a sampling: Many other amazing creatures are included among Marven's close encounters.<p>  With each successive effort, the digital wizards at Framestore CFC (Europe's largest computer-animation company) rise to new heights of photorealism, interactive lighting effects, and biological authenticity. And while Marven's a fair educator and a robust adventurer, more science-minded viewers will appreciate the 50-minute bonus program "The Science of Giants," centering on the behavior of massive dinosaurs and the efforts of renowneds paleontologist Philip Currie to prove that "megacarnivores"--once thought to roam alone--actually hunted in packs. This is really amazing stuff, and the helpful "Fact Files" provide detailed profiles of every dinosaur and sea creature featured in these memorable programs. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>These films are even more amazing than the original Walking with Dinosaurs. The animation is absolutly stunning, and Nigel Marven is great in the believable way he interacts with the creatures. True, adding a Human host does mean the Dinos get a bit less screen time than in the original "Walking" - but it's quality over quantity in this case, and there's still more Dino action to enjoy here than in all three Jurassic Park movies combined. This is by far the best, and most realistic portrayal of prehistoric nature ever, and I for one sincerely hope Mr. Marven takes on another prehistoric safari soon!</span>

                    <span>BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs shows have always been a guilty pleasure of mine, even though each one is more ludicrously inaccurate then the one before it. Still, watching computer generated dinosaurs in simulated nature photography has yet to get old. I live in the US and don't get cable so I have to wait for these shows to appear on DVD in order to watch them. Chased by Dinosaurs adds a new twist to the series, adding Nigel Marvin into the mix. I assume he is Britian's answer to the croc hunter, and he was interesting enough here for me to look for some of his other shows. The croc hunter method of storytelling makes everything much less serious and gives us about 70% less dino screen time then before, but it is still very entertaining and unique. Who doesn't want to see Nigel trying to lure a Sarcosuchus out of the water with a stick?<P>There are five 30 minute episodes on the disc. The first two explore soem of the most interesting mezezoic ecosystems, mid cretaceous south america and late cretaceous Mongolia. It's about time these awesome enviorments got Walking with Dinosaurs treatment, and it really is a pleasure to see Giganotosaurus, Therizinosaurus, Protoceratops and others brought to life by framestore's animators. Anybody with even the most marginal knowledge of dinosaurs will be frustrated by glaring in accuracies, but if viewed soley as entertainment you'll have a good time. This show has much more of dinosaurs fighting and doing "cool stuff" then the other Walking with dinosaurs shows.<P>Then there is the 3 part Sea Monsters show. This show's very theme characterizes the creatures as monsters instead of animals, but again, just view it as entertainment. There is nothing to learn here, but its a really fun 90 minutes and I found myself really getting into it. Since they're throwing people in with the dinosaurs it would have been cool if somebody got eaten, but I suppose you can't have it all.</span>

                    <span>Excellent series. Reminded me of a cross between Crocodile Hunter, Jurassic Park, and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Getting yourself into danger for no apparent reason like Croc Hunter, exciting dino scenes like Jurassic Park (without the violence), and the sense that no matter how much danger Marlin Perkins seems to be in he won't get hurt like Wild Kingdom. Best for Children (my 3 year old was captivated), but adults can learn a few things too.</span>

                    <span>This thrilling DVD was a joy to watch. Nigel Marvin is great, and his filmed "adventures" in time seem extremely real. I had to sometimes tell myself that this was all scripted and not real. Amazing effects and good "acting" on Nigel's part really made you feel that way. I highly recommend this DVD, and would like to see more made. Let's hope if this happens, Nigel will return, and not be replaced by someone extremely irritating and dim-witted like Steve Irwin, a.k.a the "crocodile hunter".</span>

                    <span>I've enjoyed the BBC historical programs about prehistoric animals and dinosaurs. I thought this was the best of them, the technology and effects are mature, and the structure as an action animal adventure program is amusing.</span>
