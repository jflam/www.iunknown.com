                <span id="Label1"><i>sed & awk</i> describes two text processing programs that are mainstays of the UNIX programmer's toolbox.  The book lays a foundation for both  programs by describing how they are used and by introducing the fundamental  concepts of regular expressions and text matching. This edition covers  the <i>sed</i> and <i>awk</i> programs as they are mandated by the POSIX  standard. It also includes a discussion of the GNU versions of both  programs, which have extensions beyond their UNIX counterparts. Many  examples are used throughout the book to illustrate the concepts discussed.</span>

                    <span>Sed and awk are, as the book adequately puts it, UNIX "powertools". Sed is quite handy and awk is even better. This book presents a breathtaking introduction to both of them, and yet still delves into the more advanced details as it constantly presents exciting and useful examples. Both sed and awk are an essential part of any UNIX operating system, and both echo with the prestige of the master programmers that designed them. Well done, Mr. Dougherty!</span>

                    <span>I've had this book for 3-4 years now and find it to be mu handiest refernce. I even use ot more than my vi book.<p>The raw power of sed and awk will humble even the proudest VB programmer and this book will help you get the most out of both the "Aho, Weinberg and Kernigan" and the "stream editor".<p>The first chapter section is entitled "May You Solve Interesting Problems" a paraphrase of the old Chinese curse, but with sed and awk no problem seems insurmountable and wil make all problems appear interesting. <p>This book is an outstanding reference and will get you up and running with both of these handy little programs in no time.<p>Just to give you an example - the first time I ever used these programs (sed and awk) I developed a cron script to query a database every day at midnight, sort the results, grabbed lines with tagged values within certain limits, added a few totals, did some averaging, "starred" the lines that departed from certain parameters, then formatted the results into a report with a header showing the dates, times and query results, statistics then packed them into a report file and e-mailed them to a dozen recipients and added a few recipients if the data was outside certain values.<p>I did this remarkable feat by copying a few examples from the book, changing a thing or two and in the end had a little shell script that was a few K-bytes at the most.<p>This VB guy from corporate worked on a VB version of the same function and ended up with six revisions, several megs in the executable and never was able to get it formatted right. Not to say that it couldn't be done but..... I wrote mine before lunch one day. He worked on his for weeks and weeks. <p>Such is the power contained within should you want to tap it Grasshopper.<p>Great book. Amaze your friends and colleagues. Have the office women ( or men)  throw flowers at your feet as you enter every day - well maybe not, but this will make you more productive. <p>You real nerds will hardly get finished with a single box of Pop Tarts before you are writing really cool scripts when using this book.<p>Like all O'Reilly books this one is terse, practical and highly usable - just like UNIX.</span>

                    <span>This is a great first book on awk and sed.  It also has one of the clearest explanations of regular expressions I could find.  I use it all the time in my database programming/data processing work. It has served me well.  There are probably more advanced features of awk that are not covered in this book but for the price it is a great bargain.  If you want to learn awk buy this book and you won't be disappointed.  You can ignore the sections on sed if you like.</span>

                    <span>sed and awk typically get a bum rap from perl users. "why learn sed or awk when perl can do both?" yes, it can. and so much more.<p>but what if you just need to print, say, the first field of a file? or just replace a few characters in a stream? what about the situations when you dont have perl handy (ie a freshly installed IRIX box)?<p>the sed & awk book is *the* standard. it's not written by anyone famous or whatnot, but it does a fantastic job of covering the basics, the meat, and advanced uses of sed and awk (and variants). <p>if you spend time on the command line and need to know a few quick tips, this is the book to have for sed and awk. you'll learn regexp material, how to use sed and awk and a bunch of useful routines. <p>highly reccomended for UNIX shell geeks.</span>
