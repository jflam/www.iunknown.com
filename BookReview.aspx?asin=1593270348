                <span id="Label1">This book is for any home user who has switched or is thinking of switching to Linux. Based on Red Hat's Fedora Core, Linux For Non-Geeks avoids geeky subjects like server and network setup and concentrates on the subjects of interest to the average home user: Installation, the Internet, playing CDs and audio files, desktop customization, games, downloading software and fonts, USB storage devices, printing, and more. Readers with only basic experience with Windows or another Linux distribution will learn how to do everything on their Linux machine that they are used to doing with Windows.</span>

                    <span>I'm writing this on my notebook. My main desktop computer is sitting to my left infected with the CoolWebSearch virus or trojan or whatever it is, to the extent that it is useless. None of the virus/adware/whatever removal software touches it. www.Microsoft.com says that I have no critical updates available at this time. I've been thinking that I need to go down to the bookstore and buy a Linux distribution and blow away XP. When a virus becomes so strong that it kills its own host it too will die, maybe that will happen with CoolWebSearch.<P>Anyway, I then found this book. In the first couple of pages it is describing who this book is for, and he says "people who have read or heard about Linux and are wondering whether or not they are ready to deal with it, perhaps being held back by the Linux-is-for-geeks stereotype." Then he says, "if you're looking for a power-user Linux book, try the next book on the shelf." Okay, he's talking directly to me, I don't want to be a geek, I just want to get some use out of my now useless computer. Then he says, the book "comes with a full Linux distribution on two CD's that includes more than enough software to" make the machine useful.<P>What more could you ask? As soon as I hit enter I'm opening the CD envelope and moving over to the other machine.</span>

                    <span>I initially dismissed this book because the publisher's comments made it sound too basic for my needs. However, after taking a look through it at the store, I changed my mind and got myself a copy. I have been using a Linux system for a while now, so I already knew the basics, but was curious about learning a little more. I suppose you could say I wanted to learn how to get started as a "geek." Fortunately, the author does not leave out people like me, because the book also works well as a primer for using commands, learning how to compile programs, and setting up a wireless card. The book also finally made it clear to me how to install fonts, which (to be honest) had been a point of confusion for me. There's also a great chapter on setting up APT, which is something I had been wanting to do for some time. All in all, the book has been a great help to me. I also liked the interestingly placed references to Vonnegut's "Sirens of Titan" snuck in here and there.</span>

                    <span>I started out in Linux with Mandrake because everyone said it was the easiest distribution for beginners, but, although the installation was pretty easy, it was nothing but endless quirks and headaches after that. There also weren't any books out there for it, so I had to try the generic Linux books, but they are useless for a real beginner - don't even understand half of them. Anyway, I decided to give Fedora a try because there are so many books for it, and that's how I ended up trying Grant's book.<P>First of all, I have to say that I like Fedora. It seems to work well, the programs that come with it seem to be set up normally, and it is pretty easy to use. I also prefer its nicely set up GNOME interface to KDE.<P>Well, as for the book, I think it is really great. It is basically what I needed - a clear and step by step guide that matches the distribution comes with it. Though there is a little more information on customizing the desktop than I thought necessary (but then to each their own), the other points seemed well balanced: hardware setup, printers, Internet, and so on. <P>The middle sections of the book covered things that seem kind of geeky (despite the title) to me, though these topics (commands, compiling programs, etc) are covered in a very easy to understand way, so no harm done. The chapter on using APT was really great because I had a really hard time installing RPMs with Mandrake. And the font installation instructions were also very useful and easy to follow.<P>The last group of chapters are pretty much overviews of software types, and the one on Music is the most useful, which is fine as the others (graphics and office applications) don't really need much explanation, though I would have liked to see a bit more information on how to use the GIMP. Of course, this is a minor point because what is covered in the book is basically everything I wanted to know to get started - 99.2% perfect!</span>

                    <span>I thought, with the reviews of this book, that I would have no problem grasping linux. Well I was wrong. The first half this book doesn't go indepth enough for a beginner. It left me baffled in many parts and had to look up the solutions on my own online and also had to recieve help from friendly people in IRC. Many of the webpages listed by the write are no longer usable or are down. Trying to follow projects without the websites that he specifies is a nightmare for a beginner. <P>The second half of the book I felt was more of a filler and wasnt useful for learning linux. But maybe I feel that way because I didnt expect half the book to be about games and programs that play music. <P>It did get me started and it did leave me with more than my foot in the door.</span>

                    <span>On the positive side, Grant writes clearly for the Linux curious, and keeps things lively (a hard feet for a technically-oriented book). You also get a relatively up-to-date version of Red Hat's desktop-oriented distribution of Linux, Fedora. You should be able to get up and running on Linux without too much difficulty, and Fedora is one of the most used Linux distributions. Still, the Fedora orientation of the book is its limitation. First, for true Linux newbies (I count myself among them), there are several distributions that may be better for getting acquainted (I like Xandros Deluxe, but there is also Mandrake, Lycoris, PCLinuxOS, and Lindows, among others- two good sites for info are desktopos.com & distrowatch.org). Second, the author spends most of his attention on one desktop gui (graphical user interface) for Linux, Gnome. While a nice environment, most of the other Linux-newbie oriented distributions use some form of the other main environment, KDE. The third problem of the books too-narrow focus on one distribution is that he covers the Redhat standard for adding Linux applications, RPM. Again, as many of the other newbie-oriented distributions are based on the highly regarded Debian Linux, while they can and do use RPM, their focus is on the Debian package management system. To be fair, Grant does spend time on KDE & Debian so that people are aware of them and have some inkling of how they differ and how to get started with them, but for someone who chooses one of the more newbie-oriented distributions that use these, you find yourself putting this book down and grabbing for other resources. I'm not sure how Grant could have been a bit more agnostic and still made this a good basic introduction, but I found that given my choice of another Linux distribution that uses KDE & Debian package management, left me quickly setting this book down and reaching for the excellent online howtos, user forums, and the more advanced introduction to Linux (and a great way to start to really get to know your way around and do things with Linux), Running Linux by Welsh, Dalheimer, Dawson, and Kaufman. Finally, Grant doesn't spend quite enough time with security and administration. While Linux is a very secure system, one cannot get lulled into relying entirely on keeping the software up-to-date. This book is focused on customizing your linux desktop & doing many of the main things for which the average home user has gotten used to doing on a computer (word processing, downloading & playing music, browsing the internet, e-mail, etc.). You will need to do a bit more to set up a firewall and make sure it is running properly, turning off any unnecessary network protocols and processes that might come turned on, etc. His sole mention of firewalls is that you should click yes to turn on Fedora's default firewall on installation. Besides the fact that someone chosing a different distribution may have to take different steps, system security needs more than a sentence telling you to select an option and a couple pages on viruses (which is much less of a concern than having someone hack your system). At a minimum, people should also look at some of the howtos on security on the main Linux sites (e.g., newtolinux.org.uk, linux.org), and books such as Hatch & Lee's, Hacking Linux Exposed, 2nd ed. If you really want to get to know Linux (and those who will be running their system without an in-house sys. admin. will really need to go further than Grant's book), two O'Reilly books may be worth looking to after getting your feet wet with this book: Running Linux, and Linux in a Nutshell. Still, you will notice that I gave the book 4 stars because it is a very good intro. It is just a little too limited in a couple important ways and require that even the 'non-geek' beginner to quickly look beyond to some of the other more thorough introductory books mentioned above.</span>
