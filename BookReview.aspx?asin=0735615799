                    <span>These days any developer is capable of throwing together a network server application, but developing a truly efficient and scalable server is akin to black magic for most. This update covers the material well, and gives the reader excellent advice on how to build better networking software with an understanding of what is going on behind the scenes.<P>My one nit would be that the examples don't compile out of the box with VC 6.0 on either NT or Win2k, even with fairly recent platform SDK headers. After a bit of error tracing and reading the book, I found that most were written using new name resolution functions found in XP, and while they will work with older platforms, it required downloading the latest platform SDK... Since you can't download just the headers, you're going to need either a fast connection or a lot of time.<P>It would have been nice to have this documented in the book, the code or at least in a 'readme.txt' file. Since the SDK is available for free, why not stick it on the CD since you can't work with the books material without it?</span>

                    <span>Patience is a virtue, Avatar. You'll need a good deal of patience while reading this book. While there is an enormous amount of valuable information in the text, I'm not sure that the book itself was actually edited. Several of the descriptions seem to drag on continuously, while a fair amount of bird walking is done in other places. I don't fault the authors with this, though. As I understand it, one of the editor's jobs is to make sure a book is grammatically correct and easy to read. <P>Another problem that I've noticed involves incorrect chapter references. For example, the SO_CONNECT_TIME referenced in chapter 7 (p. 205) refers you to chapter 6 (p. 177) for an explanation. Chapter 6 refers you to chapter 5. Are these guys doctors? Will my insurance cover this? :)<P>Programming in C# minor. 12 pages here. There really is a chapter 13. Don't flip too fast; you might miss it. Now, granted, I'm not a C# programmer, so I haven't thoroughly looked at the contents of the chapter. However, judging from the skimpiness alone, I imagine that a lot more could have been covered.<P>In fairness chapters 5 - 12 are packed with some very useful information, and the C# chapter was probably just icing. So, overall I would recommend this book. However, the book's organization and overall appearance (no shading of code samples, tables, etc.) are lacking considerably. These issues and the poor editing earn a generous 3 stars.</span>

                    <span>You would think the authors know what they are talking about when they write a book. But the source code provided does not run if you don't meet very strict requirements. The authors work for Microsoft. And they are tester/devloper. But neither they nor microsoft press bother to run their codes. My question is, if their codes are not good. How can you trust the book contents.</span>

                    <span>The C++ code after Chapter 1 in this book will not work unless you have the latest Platform SDK installed. So don't buy this book unless you meet the OS requirements for the latest Platform SDK. As of February 2003 the Platform SDK requires Windows XP, Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 SP6, or Windows Server 2003. The SDK is NOT supported on Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition.<P>I don't have any of the required OS's so running the code in this book is impossible for me. I'm not going to unfairly judge the book because of this, however. I suppose if you're a serious developer you should probably be developing on one of the required platforms anyway. I have learned a lot from this book and I could get some of the code to work with MAJOR tweaking. It's true that a lot of this book is just stuff that you could find all over the MSDN Library, but it is very nice to have it all in one book. It starts from the basics and slowly leads into more advanced topics which would be difficult to do if you're only using the MSDN Library. <P>I don't regret buying the book, and in a strange way, since I had to do so much intense research on the Winsock functions and syntax to tweak the code enough to get it to work, maybe I learned a little more than I would have if the code had just "worked out of the box". I don't recommend learning this way though, it's very frustrating. I think it's a great book if you can get the code to run, if not, then stay away.</span>
