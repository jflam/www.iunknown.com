                <span id="Label1">The Edgar Award&#8211;winning novel <i>A Conspiracy of Paper</i> was one of the most acclaimed debuts of 2000. In his richly suspenseful second novel, author David Liss once again travels back in time to a crucial moment in cultural and financial history. His destination: Amsterdam, 1659&#8212;a mysterious world of trade populated by schemers and rogues, where deception rules the day.<br><br>On the world&#8217;s first commodities exchange, fortunes are won and lost in an instant. Miguel Lienzo, a sharp-witted trader in the city&#8217;s close-knit community of Portuguese Jews, knows this only too well. Once among the city&#8217;s most envied merchants, Miguel has lost everything in a sudden shift in the sugar markets. Now, impoverished and humiliated, living on the charity of his petty younger brother, Miguel must find a way to restore his wealth and reputation.<br><br>Miguel enters into a partnership with a seduc-tive Dutchwoman who offers him one last chance at success&#8212;a daring plot to corner the market of an astonishing new commodity called &#8220;coffee.&#8221; To succeed, Miguel must risk everything he values and test the limits of his commercial guile, facing not only the chaos of the markets and the greed of his competitors, but also a powerful enemy who will stop at nothing    to see him ruined. Miguel will learn that among Amsterdam&#8217;s ruthless businessmen, betrayal lurks everywhere, and even friends hide secret agendas.<br><br>With humor, imagination, and mystery, David Liss depicts a world of subterfuge, danger, and repressed longing, where religious and cultural traditions clash with the demands of a new and exciting way of doing business. Readers of historical suspense and lovers of coffee (even decaf) will be up all night with this beguiling novel.</span>

                    <span>The Coffee Trader immediately engages the reader in a vibrant world of intrigue and high-stakes speculation in an unlikely but wonderfully exotic setting-- Amsterdam in the middle of the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century. It is a story of loyality vs. betrayal, honesty vs. duplicity, familial battles and unpredictable alliiances. David Liss has managed to capture the colorful world of Sephardic Jews, who having escaped the inferno of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, struggle to find their identity in their New Jerusalem, the sometimes not-so-tolerant Dutch Republic. The story centers around Miguel Lienzo, a Jewish commodities trader who hatches a plan to corner the market in a newly discovered commodity--coffee--and become rich overnight. His challenge is to keep his plan a secret from those who would scheme against him, including members of his own family and community. The Coffee Trader serves not only as a primer on the history of the coffee trade, but a lesson on the mechanics of trading techniques on the first modern commodities exchange-- the Bourse in Amsterdam. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of the Dutch Republic, Sephardic Jewry; coffee lovers and futures traders."</span>

                    <span>From each country I visit, I buy a book as a souvenir. While on interrail this summer, I picked up The Coffee Trader in Budapest. I had never heard of David Liss, or read his previous award-winning book A Conspiracy of Paper, but the English section in the bookstore was rather limited and this book had a nice cover and a catchy summary on the back. <P>The story takes us back to the 17th century and Amsterdam. The storys protagonist, Miguel Lienzo, a Portuguese Jew, is a sharp trader on the worlds first commodities exchange. He lost his fortune when the price of sugar dropped, and is now living with his brother and his pregnant wife. Miguel is desperate to find a way to restore hit wealth as well as his reputation as an excellent trader. Teaming up with a sexy Dutch widow, he is gambling on the volatile and speculative coffee market to do so.<P>The Coffee Trader was a quick and easy read. I liked Liss' writing style, but the story never really grabbed my full attention. It was entertaining enough, but not a page-turner.<P>A quick and entertaining read.</span>

                    <span>I loved this book. If you're looking for a well-researched novel that you can completely become engrossed in, this is it.<P>To me, I base all writers on Ken Follett, the British author who first introduced me to the absolute joy of getting lost in a novel. This book measures up very well to Follett's best.<P>You are transported to 17th Century Europe (or thereabouts, it's been a while since I've read it), and Liss' writing style is very descriptive. It's really great fun to follow the adventures of the dashing Miguel Lienzo.<P>The fact that I remember the leading man's name 16 months after reading the book speaks volumes. I wholeheartedly recommend this novel to anyone who likes a great novel.</span>

                    <span>This is a fascinating story set in the middle of the 17th century about a number of Portuguese-Jewish refugees from the Spanish Inquisition. On the enlightened shores of Amsterdam, they, along with others, make their living in commodities trading, and how remarkably little this activity has since changed over four centuries.<P>As they do now, traders gamble over the rise and fall of prices by buying and selling "puts" (an option giving one the right to sell at a later date for an artificially-high price) and "calls", (an option giving one the right to buy at a later date for an artificially-low price). Having once briefly dabbled in commodities trading, I am familiar with these strategies but never before imagined that they were anything other than 20th-century innovations.<P>Yet at one stage, one trader cynically advises another, "Go buy whale oil - not futures, but the thing itself. You may remember that the rest of the world still transacts business in that quaint manner."<P>The story specifically centers around the efforts of one trader in particular, Miguel Lienzo, who is introduced to a wondrous new fruit called "coffee" that when ground and brewed into drink imparts astonishing powers of reason and concentration and also has the power to preserve health, help digestion, and cure consumption and other maladies of the lung, as well as fluxes, jaundice and inflammation. One character in the novel naively crunches this "fruit" between her teeth before learning of its greater appeal as a brew.<P>Anticipating a tremendous demand for this new commodity, Miguel arrives at a plan to use his trading acumen to acquire a monopoly on it, all the while juggling business and personal affairs that threaten to undo him before his plan comes to fruition. These affairs include Miguel's need to resolve the conflict between the duty of honesty and fidelity that Jewish law imposes upon him with the harsh realities of life on the Exchange and outside the Exchange. They also include the Ma'amad, the self-regulatory Jewish body that actually adopts some of the Inquisition's methods for the greater good of the community.<P>As we follow Miguel's progress, we also note the presence of affable moneylender, Alonzo Alferonda, a victim of "cherem" (excommunication from the Jewish community at the hands of the Ma'amad), manipulating events behind the background - though the extent and the purpose of this manipulation is not revealed until the end.<P>Commodities trading in the year 1659 is essentially a product of rumor and the uses to which it is put, and in an environment unregulated by any sort of futures trading commission, false rumors are used to manipulate the market but are used sparingly lest their sources be regarded as completely untrustworthy for future purposes.<P>In such a world, the dividing line between what is real and what only APPEARS real is often sketchy, and this uncertainty is symbolic of a similar dichotomy of the events in Miguel's life. Who are his friends and who are his enemies? To what extent will his understanding of this be turned on its head by the end of the novel?<P>Does coffee really have a medicinal power to keep us alert and vital, especially now that it comes freeze-dried and/or packaged? Or do we drink it in the morning now out of force of habit? It has since become the definitive American drink and has been so for some time, but I'm actually not aware that it has produced a nation of alert and vital people.<P>Still, having read this novel, I know that I, for one, will never again regard my morning "cuppa" in quite the same way.</span>

                    <span>I very much enjoyed the historical part of this book. The picture of historical Amsterdam and the information about early commodities trading were fascinating. Even the characters were interesting. What kept the book from being more satisfying was that all of the characters were scammers -- not my favorite sort of person -- and that it was difficult to care what happened to any of them. First, one person would appear to be winning, and then another would trick him, and all along, it made no difference to me whether this one or that one ended up ascendant. I couldn't even say that one person was more wicked or more pathetic or more interesting than another.<BR> Liss is a good writer who keeps the prose moving right along. The basis of the story is very interesting to me. Maybe the idea that Liss wanted to convey was that there are no honest or big-hearted businessmen. But if so, that is an unsatisfying picture of the world.<BR> I give the novel three stars because the historical information was good enough to overcome my disappointment with the novel.</span>
