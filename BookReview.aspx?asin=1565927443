                <span id="Label1"><I>SQL in a Nutshell</I> applies the classic O'Reilly "Nutshell" format  to Structured Query Language (SQL), the elegant descriptive language that's used  to create and manipulate stores of data. This book explains the purpose and  proper syntax of hundreds of SQL statements, as defined in four major SQL  implementations, and details each entry with explanatory text and illustrative  examples. Perhaps best of all, authors Kevin and Daniel Kline feature MySQL in  their coverage, and give it billing that's equal to that of Oracle, Microsoft  SQL Server, and PostgreSQL. Their inclusion of open-source MySQL, which in most  situations carries no license fee, is recognition of its growing popularity and  suitability for serious database applications; also, it improves this book's  appeal to Unix and Linux developers.<p>  The majority of this slender book comprises eminently useful syntax  documentation (which is in the style of Unix man pages, with bracketed options  and monospace arguments) and the other information that's specific to individual  statements and functions. Additionally, it includes a relatively small amount of  conceptual information, such as a section on the proper use of NULL values. The  material that's not statement-specific also contrasts data-type implementations  of the four covered platforms--for example, readers learn that a PostgreSQL int2  value is known as a smallint in ANSI standard SQL. This is a particularly handy  reference book, if you use one of the emphasized SQL implementations. <I>--David  Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Structured Query Language (SQL), as implemented in  Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, as well as in ANSI standard  SQL (SQL92 and SQL99). After an introduction to data types and relational  database fundamentals (the latter is not emphasized), the authors document SQL  statements and functions, one by one and alphabetically. They take care to point  out differences among the four implementations.</span>

                    <span>I have to question whether any of the other reviewers even looked at the table of contents before purchasing this book:<P>Chapter 1. SQL, Vendor Implementations, and Some History - a general overview of SQL and where it comes from; <P>Chapter 2. Foundational Concepts - The general theory behind how a sql works; <P>Chapter 3. SQL Statements Command Reference - "Quick SQL Command Reference"; <P>Chapter 4. SQL Functions - A standard function reference and vendor extensions; <P>Chapter 5. Unimplemented SQL99 Commands - commands in the sql standard which aren't implemented by vendors (MS, Oracle); <P>So as to what it says it covers, it does it quite well. Already being quite familiar with SQl, I still found this book to be useful both as a quick reference to commands as well as for a deeper understanding into how SQL works. This book makes an excellent companion to Transact-SQL Programming, also by Oreilly. If you need a complete SQL reference, get Transact-SQL. If you're looking for a background and introduction to SQL, get this book.</span>

                    <span>I've always been impressed with O'Reilly's ability to pack so much information into one of its "In a Nutshell" titles. By starting off with a little bit of history and then running head first into the core concepts and constructs of the language they allow you to hit the ground running. The bulk of this technical reference covers the wide variety of statements that SQL uses with in-depth explanation of each. Something that I was unaware of until reading this book is that SQL has preexisting functions aside from its cases. This wonderful reference has everything you'll need to start creating SQL databases for your specific distribution, (SQL, MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL).</span>

                    <span>I have always enjoed Klein's books, and this is another fine one from him. It is not product-specific, so if you need that, you will need other books. But the ANSI SQL solutions here are quite good and very useful in many cases. I would think that they would work with most of the DBMS's on the market. The explanations are good and the sample code is quite extensive.</span>

                    <span>This book is designed as a reference -- the book that you keep <BR>near your workstation after you learn the basics, because you<BR>haven't got everything memorised yet. It's great for that. I<BR>refer to it when I have a question.<P>But actually I picked up this book with no prior knowledge of<BR>SQL (except that I knew it was for doing database stuff) and<BR>learned enough to get started in a couple of days. The intro<BR>is great for that. <P>The great thing about this book is that it covers the four<BR>major SQL implementations in a relatively unbiased fashion.<BR>This is nice because if you switch from one to another you<BR>don't have to go looking for a new book. (Otherwise, you<BR>would; as you will see from reading this book, the various<BR>implementations differ considerably and also differ from<BR>the unimplemented standard, which the book also covers.) <P>This book is not, and is not intended to be, a tutorial for<BR>people who are utterly unfamiliar with the very concept of<BR>a database, but it's okay to be utterly unfamiliar with SQL.<P>This book also is not a strategy guide for how to plan and<BR>organise your database; this is an _implementation_ book.<BR>As such, it doesn't cover things like deciding which data<BR>to put in which table, when to create another table and <BR>when to create an entirely separate database, or that sort<BR>of thing. What it does tell you is what query syntax you<BR>need to create and interact with your database, your tables,<BR>and the data in your tables. It also explains datatypes, <BR>because they vary considerably between the different SQL<BR>implementations, and table types and the various attributes<BR>(indeces and whatnot). <P>Additionally, this book is not a security guide. It does <BR>include information about permissions, but only in terms of<BR>the syntax used, not in terms of strategy.</span>
