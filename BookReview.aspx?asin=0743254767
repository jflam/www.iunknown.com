                    <span>I started attending Celtics games just after Bob Cousy retired as a player.  Naturally, I had seen many of his playoff games on television but the game looks much different in the arena than on the small screen.  Having listened to his many road broadcasts over the years, I felt I knew a lot about his philosophy of basketball.  For me the potential appeal of this book was to understand how he became the great offensive innovator who helped establish classic Celtics fast break and passing basketball. 
<br />
<br />I found the answer to my question in Cousy's difficult early years, growing up poor in a family where his parents didn't get along and where coaches assessed by his size rather than the size of his heart.  From those hardscrabble beginnings, Cousy developed a fundamental insecurity that meant that winning wasn't a desire, it was the only state of being that was acceptable to his perfectionist self.  But that psychological need was balanced by a strong identification with the underdog and the oppressed . . . even if he wasn't always sensitive enough to act on those feelings as often as he could have.  I enjoyed that part of the book very much.
<br />
<br />But the bulk of the book is really about how professional basketball went from being a minor attraction beneath both the college game and the Harlem Globetrotters into today's massive and profitable business for the players.  Having grown up with that transition, I found the book to be a pretty superficial rehash of what I already knew.  I didn't enjoy that part of the book very much.  But if you are under the age of 25, this material will be new to you, and you will probably find it to be interesting.  You will probably rate the book higher than I did as a result.  
<br />
<br />The book's other weakness is that it is rather like a career highlight video . . . just visiting the high spots of Cousy's life.  For someone who wants to know more, you'll have to read another book.

                    <span>With all the hype, with all the publicity from the NBA in the past forty years or so, it's mainly us old types who remember. Especially us old types who lived in Boston. The Celtics were like the Yankees of baseball, the Green Bay Packers of football. And the Celtics were Cousy and Russell. 
<br />
<br />This book does a supurb job of talking about professional (and college) basketball as it changed in the fifties from a dream to a main line professional sport. He picked the right character to use as the centerpiece of the story. Bob Cousy was everything the sport needed, a superstar player, a solid family man when that was one of the things expected from a professional athelete, unassuming but with a killer instinct to win. 
<br />
<br />This was a time when at 6' 2" Cousy could be a superstar, and there was never any question of anything like the drug mess that is currently hitting baseball. Perhaps life was simpler then, although there was the fear of the Soviet Union and nuclear war, and Bob Cousy was the perfect man for the time. Wonderful book.</span>
