                <span id="Label1">The sedimentary cross-section views and eerie rock formations of Arches and Canyonlands National Parks can give visitors the impression that they've missed their turn and ended up on Mars. Bill Schneider gives a guided tour of this surreal land with descriptions of 63 hikes for Arches and the three regions of Canyonlands: the Maze, the Needles, and Island in the Sky. Hike descriptions include classics such as Balanced Rock, Fiery Furnace, Tower Arch, and Murphy Basin. No-frills is the name of the game here. You won't find too many amusing anecdotes, but their absence allows the guide to fit neatly in any pack. <I>--Benjamin Tiffany</I></span>

                    <span>We used this guide to do six hikes in the two National Parks and it provided excellent information for all of them. The writeups, descriptions, maps & summary information were all accurate and very helpful. Bill Schneider even seemed to anticipate the few times we would have a problem -- each time we were unsure of the trail direction, a quick look at the book showed that he had specifically included extra comments for the problem we had encountered. I recommend it wholehearedly for anyone wanting to hike in Canyonlands & Arches.</span>

                    <span>I ordered this book for an upcoming hiking and biking trip in the Arches and Canyonland areas.  We are striking out on our own after using a guided tour last fall. We are excited and apprehensive that we will not know where to go.  This book is very detailed about the trails and we are now more confident about our adventure.  I am glad that I ordered it.</span>

                    <span>This is a terrific book, with all the information necessary to begin some really interesting hikes.  Details on each hikes include a description of the scenery, terrain (with a nice graphic showing the elevation changes throughout a hike), difficulty rating, total distance, time required, type of trip and trail.  The details give a hikers perspective on each trail.  Sections on backcountry roads, are also useful.  The book lacks an index at the end. There are some informative tables in the beginning of the book that describe all the trails and a classification for each.  Useful to gauge a hike to your experience level.  Tons of pictures and maps.<p>Overall a very useful guide.</span>

                    <span>Many people think that the best way to see these two great canyonlands parks is to drive through them. But you will have no sense of these places unless you get out of your car and take a walk. You don't have to be a  backpacker to experience these places on foot. Exploring Canyonlands and  Arches is a great book for short, medium and long hikes and for finding the  hike that is best for you and your physical condition.</span>
