                    <span>Your book, 201 Best Questions to Ask On Your Interview got me an offer! A couple of days before my interview my father had suggested I ask the following question during my interview:<p>What's the most important thing I can do to help within the first 90 days of my employment?<p>After I heard this question, I thought, wow! What a great question to ask. My father had apparently spoken with you a few days before my interview and had relayed this question to me from you to ask (say that 3 times fast). I had learned from my father that you had actually written books on the topic of interviews and questions to ask, so I immediately ran to the store to pick up a copy. I picked up a copy of your book on a Tuesday late evening and had read it from front to back 3 times before my interview on Thursday morning.<p>I am strongly convinced that your book got me an offer! Thank you. I have been on many interviews throughout my short time in the workforce and had never felt as comfortable as I did in my last interview after reading your book. I was amazed to hear hiring managers and human resource representatives respond to the questions I asked them. Their responses were nearly identical to the responses you stated in your book.<p>Again, thank you for a great book and the job offer. I may have been able to pull it off without reading your book, but I'm convinced (especially in today's market) that your questions placed me at the top of the pile.</span>

                    <span>I recently had the opportunity to interview for a senior position in a company that that seems to be exceptionally good for me.  While I actually knew one of the senior executives I was interviewing with, he had confirmed to me that it was extremely important for me to have a strong positive impact on one of the other two interviewers. <p>On my flight to the interview, I reviewed this book and found a number of questions that I wanted to keep on hand for the "right time" - and I jotted them down - along with others that were more specific to the position, product, and industry, then organized them according to categories - product, company, job, etc.<p>During the interview, I asked a number of them, and almost each time I asked a question, the hiring executive paused, and then said something like "that's an excellent question" and then went into a thoughtful and valuable response.  His answers to these questions gave me a tremendous insight into the company that I might not have gotten without asking the questions.<p>At the same time, my questions demonstrated my level of interest in the position, the company, and his opinions.  They showed that I was prepared, thoughtful, and intelligent. <br> <br>While I might have been able to come up with them on my own, John Kador's book helped me identify the key questions to ask, and even helped with the phrasing of the questions to have the greatest possible impact. <p> I asked questions like:<p>     What are the three top priorities for the person in this position in the next 90 days?<p>and<p>     What are the key characteristics you're looking for in the person who you select for this position?<p>I am certain that the interviewer thought more of me for asking thoughtful questions - even though I think he liked me before I asked them.<p> This is a quick and easy book to read, and an easy book to use.  The ideas that it includes - in addition to the questions it offers - are not "rocket science", but they are offered and described in ways that can be easily adapted to the situation you're in.  The "tips" on interviewing are also quite useful in general.<p>This book has already proven helpful and valuable and I will refer to it before any job interview I have in the future.  While there are many books on interviewing and job hunting, this one is a quick study, easy to read, and most importantly, very useful.  I highly recommend it to anyone interviewing for any level position.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to write and say THANK YOU!! For the first time in a number of years, I felt like I had an excellent interview. Up until this past weekend, I was having problems with interviews. The main thing: Questions. I couldn't figure out why I was being turned down for positions left and right, even though my qualifications were that of what they called for. I had almost given up hope. I was looking for jobs as a field technician nationwide. I heard nothing.<p>My mom, who is a temporary staffing recruiter, picked your book "201 Best Questions to ask on your interview" for me, and read this book, taking notes as I went along. I had about 4 days to prepare for this interview, and felt pressured. But seeing some of the "Questions NOT to ask", I cracked a smile, and felt better.<p>When I went to the interview, I felt very comfortable with the situation, knowing that by reading your book, I now knew what to do, and what not to do. The interview lasted an hour and a half, in which the interviewer and I sat and chatted about non-interview items.<p>Today, I wrote the interviewer to ask if a decision had been reached, and was shocked to receive a phone call from him, offering me the position. I almost fell out of my chair.<p>In the end, I thank two people. God, as my heavenly father, guiding me through this interview, and you, for helping me out with the hard parts of the interviewing process to which I probably would not have received this position without.<p>To me, seeing success after the first interview from reading your book, it paid for itself, seeing the smile on my face when I heard the answer. I will recommend it to friends and family.<p>Once again, thank you so much!</span>

                    <span>I read the book from cover to cover, in one sitting and found it profoundly comprehensive and entertaining.   I didn't want to put it down.  As I read, I kept saying, "Yes, uh-huh, that's true, that's really good."  As a recruiter, I know my candidates would be more successful if they took greater responsibility for a successful interview through asking appropriate questions.  The question is an invaluable tool to communicate something to me that hasn't been covered during the interview; when done well, it's one more chance to help me see the fit of the candidate to the position.  <br>John Kador's interviewing insights and list of questions enable the job seeker to think more strategically, promote their strengths, and communicate more professionally during the different stages of the interview process.  <br>I'd definitely recommend this book to even the most experienced interviewers! (and even a few recruiters!)</span>
