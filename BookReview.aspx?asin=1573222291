                <span id="Label1">"This is a wonderful book, a wake-up call of startling clarity and insight, with a flood of facts and anecdotes that place the abstract into riveting human perspective. I will never turn on the rap again without thinking about where water comes from and where it goes." (Ken Burns, producer and director of the <i>Civil War</i>, <i>Baseball</i>, and <i>Jazz</i> documentaries.) <br><br>  The story of water is complex, with roots as deep as civilization itself, but what we hear about it today is simple and stark: the world's supply is in severe crisis. Even when we're not confronted with alarming news of another drought, we're reminded of environmental changes and a growing world population that threaten to turn water into a matter over which wars will be fought. Despite these urgent warnings, how many of us can say we understand the elemental forces that brought us to such a precarious state, or what we might do to get out of it?  <br><br> Taking us on a world tour of the most hotly contested water climates, and introducing us to some of the most passionate advocates to emerge from them, Diane Raines Ward gives us a compelling account of where we've come from, and where we need to go. Why is the Fertile Crescent, historically one of the most lush places on earth, fast becoming a region of scarcity? What do Dutch watermen, steeped in their centuries-old, folkloric battle to protect their coasts, know about rising seas that we don't?  Why are certain environmentalists so eager to dismantle thousands of years' worth of engineered solutions to distributing water? And how is it that the very technology vilified by conservationists may be the only thing that can save us? Through a narrative that's breathtakingly clear and filled with fresh insight, Ward answers these and other paradoxical questions, and gives us a bold perspective on a subject to which our fate is inextricably bound.</span>

                    <span>Ms. Ward's book left me with a lot to think about. The next true crisis in the world will be "water". One thing that I was thoroughly impressed was the way she not only presented problems, but, probably solutions. The recent North Carolina drought showed that everyone in the near future will begin to experience water problems. Ms. Ward's book reminded me that we need to think more about permanent solutions instead of stop gap measures</span>

                    <span>Ward takes a comprehensive and world-wide view of the problem of managing water, and I learned a considerable amount from her book. She writes with an easy style. (Another reviewer calls it "the best book on water that I've read"; that's true for me, too, but in my case it's faint praise since I've only read this book!) Clearly, water management is becoming more important as the world's population grows, and given the public policy decisions facing most nations, it is a subject that the average citizen will need to learn more about. Unfortunately, the book has a couple of flaws. First, it is shallow technically, even for a popular non-fiction book; Ward could benefit by providing additional depth on both the technology of watershed management and the dominant legal structures behind it. Second, I found the footnotes to be very poorly written; frequently direct quotes appear without footnotes, and on many occasions the information in a footnote is almost a non-sequitur when compared to the footnoted text.</span>

                    <span>This is a terrific book-passionate, informed, wide-ranging, and filled with lots of quotes and anecdotes. And it's very personal-Ms. Ward isn't writing from an armchair-she's been to all the places she writes about, and it shows. She's got a great sense of drama and eye for detail-you're right there with her in the helicopter when she flies low over a network of rivers. And because she knows the subject so well, Ms. Ward places all the twists and turns in her fascinating story in a broad, historical context. I'll never look at a glass of water in quite the same way again.</span>

                    <span>Although there were a few technical errors, the book was full of interesting facts about the state of fresh water in different parts of the world. Unfortunately, except for some information about the water issues in India, there was little that was new. The chapters were in themselves fairly interesting but there was no real continuity. There was a lack of of purpose. After the final chapter on the Everglades, the book just quit. There are better books and articles on this subject available. Nice try though.</span>
