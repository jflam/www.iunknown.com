                    <span>Wether or not this book is right for you, really depends on what you need from a Javascript text book. Armed with some basic knowledge of HTML, this was the perfect text to put me up to speed on the topic. There are many examples (as the title implies), giving you an exhaustive treatment of all topics. This treatment doesn't leave anything out, and though it would be nice to have the answers to the exercises, anything which stumps you can be solved by going over the examples again.
<br />
<br />There are many explanations for every example given, but it's quite easy to skip around to what you need if you know some of the material already.
<br />
<br />Excellent self-study tool.</span>

                    <span>A few discrepancies between the examples, explanations, and especially the CD, eg: where I think she changed a file or variable name in one place and forgot to change it in the other, so you spend some time trying to reconstruct what she meant to say.<br>Otherwise well paced, good for learning.</span>

                    <span>I think chapter 8 misuses the term "inheritance", which will muddy the waters for someone trying to understand inheritance. It says "Each object has a prototype whose properties it inherits". Would it be better to say "You can tack new methods or properties on to an existing class (eg: String) using the prototype property"?</span>

This book will be a valuable teaching and reference tool.<p>Please rate the instructional value of the book from 1-5:<br>4=I would recommend this book to someone interested in its topic.  	<p>Please rate the reference value of this book from 1-5 where:  	<br>5=A complete reference.  I would not need any additional reference on this topic.<p>  <br>This is an excellent book for beginners of Javascript.  it takes simplest of the cases without boggling the minds of the readers.  when I learnt javacript more than 4 years back, Ihad a hard time reading through 'verbose' books.  I wish I had this book at that time.<p>This author has taken the time to explain the concepts in the simplests of the ways.  there are adequate screen prints to highlight the results of the executed javascript code.  the author explains the document object model clearly for the benefit of the beginners and also explains different ways of identifying the items in the page.  <p>This is an excellent reference book for intermediate javascript programmers adn this book has found a place in my reference shelf and I will be glad to recommend this book to anybody interested in learning Javascript.</span>

                    <span>JavaScript is most often used in a browser on the client side. It is a scripting language that can make vanilla HTML pages more interactive. By now it, like HTML, is very stable. And if you design web pages, it is a good addition to your skill set. Being stable and popular means that there is no shortage of books on it. So on what basis should you prefer this book?<p>Well, it takes its title very literally. The pedagogy really does emphasise copious examples. In a typical chapter, the examples take up over half the space. Plus each chapter includes a problem set. Yay! You need to learn by doing. Yet so many computer books omit this. Granted, some topics require so many parts to interoperate that writing problems is nontrivial. But to test JavaScript code, all you need is a browser, text editor and a web server. These days, all computers have the first two items. And, in the context of you wanting to learn JavaScript, you DO have a web server that you can load files onto, don't you?<p>My only quibble is that I wish there were more problems in each chapter. This could take up very little extra room, say a page per chapter. But it would roughly triple the number of problems, and give the reader an even more exhaustive exploration of the topics.</span>
