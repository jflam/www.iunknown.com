                    <span>This was a great second to the Lost Years of Merlin books. In this story Stagmar has been defeated and the Treasures of Fincarya are found and saved from the destruction of the Shrouded Castle. However things are not well yet. The warrior goblins and wights still walk the land, though not as profucely as before. The blight still covers much of Fincarya. A council is called. There it is decided that the Flowering Harp, one of the Treasures of Fincarya, is to be place in the hands of Merlin, a young wizard who took his name in memory of Trouble (a troublesome merlyn in the first book). Merlin's stask is to heal the land from the blight and not to be swayed by anything until his quest is done. Eventually Merlin finds himself on the shore where he first landed on Fincarya. Merlin has missed his mother, Elen of the Saphirre Eyes, and,using his powers and the help of the wise sea shell, brings her to Fincarya. However Rhit Gwar lays a trap for Merlin, hoping to kill him. The deadly trap is instead tripped by Elen, the only cure being made by Dadga in the Otherworld. Merlin must now master the souls of the seven songs of wizardry, written in Abrassa by Tathana, Merlin's Grandfather. Once he masters the songs he must also defeat a giant with a look that literally kills.

                    <span>The Seven Songs of Merlin by T.A. Barron
<br />
<br />   The Seven Songs is a great book by one of my favorite authors. Merlin is a young 14 year old kid. He doesn't thing he has what it takes to be a wizard. Being the Grandson of Tuatha the greatest wizard of his time. He feels in the shadow of something greater.
<br />   The Plot has a lot to do with the title. Merlin abandons his quest in the dark hills and goes to see his mother Elen. To bring her to Fincayra he must find the wisest of the speaking shells. Then an unexpected twist comes. His mother becomes hanging for life at the edge of one month. Now with the fate of his own mother in his hands he must find the souls of the seven songs passed down by Tuatha. Now the clock is ticking and he must now defeat a terrible ogre to enter the otherworld to save his mother.
<br />   This book takes place all over the magical island of Fincayra. This book has seven morals one for each song. Like "every creature has the ability to change." and "the strongest bonds are in the heart." and others.
<br />   I loved this book because it taught me 7 things. Also because I love this specific genre. The Seven Songs of Merlin is a great book that everyone can get excited about!

                    <span>This book is about  a boy named Merlin who is sent on a quest to heal the dark hills. While he is doing this, he finds his mother. But when they meet she is infected by the shadow of death. So now Merlin is off to learn the seven songs of wizardry. He must find the souls of each of the seven songs befor he can go into the Otherworld well. He has one month to learn the souls and get back to his mother befor she dies. I recommend this book to 7th through 9th grade.
<br />
<br />This book was great. The book i read was interseting if you like books about midievil times. The plot kpet me guessing the whole way through the book. After last year when I had to read a book thatmy teacher assigned to a group, I just loved it. That book was The Fires of Merlin. by T.A. Barron. I got hooked on the book set. There are Several books in this set. But I will tell you to read them in order because you will get confused. The frist book is THe Lost Years of Merlin. They are all great books.</span>
