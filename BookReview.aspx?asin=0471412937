                <span id="Label1">From a bestselling author and expert--a soon-to-be classic on application development<br>    Representing a significant change of focus in software engineering, the business rule approach to application development benefits all decision makers. Managers looking to take advantage of new opportunities will turn to business rules to implement change. IT has already learned the benefits of separating data by processing and managing data as an independent component of systems. A rules-extended development approach does exactly the same thing for business rules: by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written, it shortens the time necessary to implement change. Bestselling author Barbara von Halle (The Handbook of Relational Database Design from Addison Wesley) presents the first book to show in practical, real-world terms how to build applications using business rule concepts and techniques. This authoritative guide will give readers:<br>    o Complete guidance for system designers and database managers<br>    o The motivation for using the business rule approach<br>    o Techniques for discovering and managing rules<br>    o Guidance on how to conduct rule analysis<br>    o Steps for designing the implementation options of the rules, as well as designing workflow and database components</span>

                    <span>I bought this book based on some of the enthusiastic reviews here but was very disappointed.  I think people who see rules engines as the next big thing and are very excited about it may be enthusiatistic about this book because it pushes that line very hard.  However, there is very little in this book that reflects hard practical experience or that is likely to surprise an experienced software designer with a basic understanding of rules engines.  Good books on this subject are still waiting to be written.
<br />
<br />Instead of this book I would recommend reading "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans and the documentation for whatever rules systems you are considering.

                    <span>I find the concepts introduced in the book such as categorisation of business rules, and the worked examples using a few products very useful.<p>However, I wish the book can be less verbose, with less repetition of the same concepts (such as continuously expounding on the advantages of business rules approach) throughout the whole book.  They are distracting and not necessary.  The book could have been more concise.  <p>This is a topic worth exploring into and I hope some of UML/MDA efforts can incorporate the ideas here.</span>

                    <span>I purchased Barbara von Halle's book after the 2001 Business Rules Forum in New Orleans.  This forum is an annual meeting of experts, vendors, and participants in the business rules "evolution" and is used to share ideas and information among colleagues in the field.  Barbara's book was introduced in many of the forum presentations, which prompted me to make the purchase.  This action was perhaps the most significant step I have taken to fully understand the business rules methodology and has saved my current project from almost certain failure.  <p>I have now implemented many of the ideas and techniques from the book and placed my business rules project on a road to success.  My project has endured many obstacles, not the least of which is understanding the differences that are imposed on the project team from traditional re-engineering efforts.  If I hadn't come across Barbara's excellent documentation on project scoping, rules discovery, and designing for the business rules approach, I would have seriously doubted our ability to implement the project successfully.  My project team was able to read and comprehend the most important concepts from the book and we have been able to modify our project plan to incorporate her ideas and techniques.<p>I believe it is our responsibility as IT professionals to recognize the importance of the business rules movement and to follow a strict methodology when implementing any rules engine initiative.  I must personally thank Barbara for sharing some of the most important concepts with this methodology.  I honestly consider it my blueprint for success.</span>

                    <span>Dear Reader,<p>Business Rules, like Data Warehousing, both have the potential to dramatically reverse the downward spiral in the credibility and coherence of many IT organizations. Both initiatives focus on giving the business what it wants; Data Warehousing from mainly a strategic decision-making perspective and Business Rules from mainly an operational-support and tactical-orientation perspective. <p>To understand the importance of the role of Business Rules in business is to recognize a done deal, to actively go about leveraging Business Rules as the key component in process development, application development and application evolution is really the thing that will separate the smart people from the sceptics. <p>One of the problems of Business Rules, like Data Warehousing as well, is that they are both seemingly intuitive - the sort of thing that one could do just by imagining oneself what needs to be done. Now, don't let me put you off, and I would say that there is an element of truth in the idea that, at a certain level of abstraction, both the Data Warehousing and Business Rules concepts are very straightforward. However, and this is the crux of the matter, there are a number of seemingly small and insignificant project decisions to be made where the right decisions (based on experience) are not always the most obvious or intuitive choices, especially when we base our decisions on knowledge of other IT project methods, and,  which in turn could lead to decisions that result in the collapse of your BR or DW project and the failure of yet another IT project.<p>So, if you think that Business Rules might be just the thing for your business then read this book. In it you will find a wealth of knowledge and experience. It leads the reader from a good description of real reasons for using the Business Rules approach, Business Rules concepts, through to the process of identifying, defining and capturing Business Rules, and describes, in great detail, an iterative project approach to the active and evolutionary management of Business Rules in business. The book is well structured, is easy to read - for such a detailed book - and, focuses on important issues, options and decisions involved in Business Rules. <p>As a long term advocate of the Business Rules approach I could not rate this book more highly.<p>Best regards,<p>Martyn R Jones<br>Iniciativa Org, SL</span>

                    <span>The business rules approach offers a solid advancement in systems development and Barbara's book expounds concrete steps that you may take to implement the method in your organization. <p>My principle criticism of the text is that the first half of the book has been poorly edited and is almost impossible to read. There are many sloppy sentences, grammar errors and redundant constructions. Because this topic is important to me I took several weeks slogging through the book to adsorb the materials I needed. This should have taken much less time.<p>The book takes a very strong relational database approach to the mapping of terms constraints and facts. If fact, a substantial portion of the book is devoted to recycled relational data modeling and for some reason this part of the book is more flowing and eloquent. The text's arguments are weakest when the author presents a poor understanding of current object technology.  For instance, there is no discussion of patterns and many of the declarations of the limitation of Object Technology are uninformed. I would suggest that those with OOSE orientation overlook this bias. There is some good material for OO practitioners.<p>There are two competing views in the business rules camps. One view is that business rules presents and solid requirements gathering technique. The next view is that business rules are all about application generation.  The first technique has spawned software product that 'listen' to the data in the database in a 'rules engine'. Barbara Van Halle describes these tools. Eloquent presents the second view.<p>In summary, if you are seriously considering the addition of business rules methods to your project or organization then buy and read this book otherwise wait for a second edition.</span>
