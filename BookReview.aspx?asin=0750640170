                    <span>The 21 articles in Relationship Marketing for Competitive Advantage are wide-ranging, covering manufacturing and services, business and consumer database marketing, and retail. All in all, they represent some of the best  writing on relationship marketing including seminal works by marketing  experts from around the world such as Theodore Levitt, Leonard Berry, David  Maister and Christian Gr√∂nroos.<p>The fundamental principle upon which  relationship marketing is founded is that the greater the level of customer  satisfaction with the relationship with the supplier-not just the product  or service-then the greater the likelihood that the customer will stay with  the supplier. Retaining customers is important, as there is strong evidence  to suggest that customer retention is directly related to profitability. It  appears that the longer the customer stays with a supplier, the higher the  likelihood that they will place a greater amount of business with the  supplier, even to the extent of single sourcing. Further, there is a  likelihood that these retained customers will cost less to service and that  they will be less likely to be motivated solely by price.<p>At the heart of  relationship marketing is the integration, company-wide, of hitherto  separate customer service and total quality initiatives with the mainstream  of marketing strategy. Conventionally, customer service and quality have  been managed separately from marketing. In the relationship marketing  paradigm, they are intertwined and managed as one. The rationale behind  this is that it is upon service and quality that relationships are  built.<p>Edited by academics from the Cranfield School of Management, the  articles in this book are supplemented with summaries and commentaries,  highlighting a broad scope of issues such as customer retention, employee  satisfaction, supplier relations and the management of service quality.  These issues are brought together to provide an integrated approach to the  development of a relationship marketing strategy. This book of linked  readings has been designed to reinforce themes first developed in  Relationship Marketing by Christopher, Payne and Ballantyne  (Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 1991) and provides a solid basis for the  further development of relationship marketing as a discipline and as a  practical orientation.</span>
