                    <span>I write as a natural talker (but, as a minister, I try to help others who are weak here, hence my research) who has no trouble with small talk, and Carducci's booklet is indeed a summary of how we talkers do indeed initiate small talk.<p>Keep this in mind: this booklet(and it is small,about 77 half pages)zeros in on small talk, not the details of indepth conversation, developing friendship, or overcoming shyness. Carducci provides sample conversations to show how not to do it, and then offers the positive alternative approach.The author outlines key concepts and so that you can get a handle on them.<p>He could emphasize body language more than he does, yet he does touch on it. So if you are wanting to improve your small talking skills, this is a quick summary of how to do just that.</span>

                    <span>This fabulous guide helps you do exactly what it says on the cover. Initially I had mixed success following Carducci's tips - he advises the reader to "talk about subjects which interest you" yet I always felt that I was encountering a brick wall when I brought up my trophy-mounted roadkill collection. Then again, we are a nation of dog-lovers. However, I have really come into my own now I realise that by continually reminding the person I am talking to of how utterly inconsequential and boring my conversation is I can disguise myself as an ironic wit.</span>

                    <span>I was a little surprised at how small this book was, but it had some good information and helped fill out the information that I got from Conversationally Speaking by Alan Garner (EXCELLENT!!) and the audiotapes The Fine Art of Small Talk by Deborah Fine (VERY, VERY GOOD!).</span>

                    <span>This book depressed me more than helped me.  I really didn't tell me anything I don't already know.  First of all, the first half of the book says how small talk is easy and effortless if you don't think about it too much.  Then second half of the book tells you all the things you should remember when making small talk.  This is a big contradiction.  Second, the examples are way too far from real life.  In the "first date" example, the couple talk about more interesting stuff in 2 minutes than I've done in the last 2 years.  Quite frankly, it would be easy to make small talk if I had that much to say.  Lastly, this book didn't tell me anything I don't already know.  All it says is to ask questions and be interested in the person you are talking to.  If I wasn't interested in the person, I wouldn't be trying to talk to them.  This book may help some people, but it was a waste of time for me.</span>
