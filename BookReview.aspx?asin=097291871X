                    <span>I must say this is the best book currently available on the topic of meeting women today. Unlike other books that are mostly vague, uninformed nonsense, The System is direct, specific knowledge on what works. You'll be able to read the book, head to the local mall (I've done this) and immediately be able to test parts of The System, in a non-threatening way. I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's the real deal.</span>

                    <span>The author made a lot of good points about the process of picking up a girl. I couldn't believe there was even a flowchart. I liked the simplicity of the book. It was easy to read, the points were very well supported, and I didn't get the fluff that I get from many of the other books on this subject. Overall, I thought it was pretty entertaining as well.</span>

                    <span>The book was actually on the mark with how to drive women crazy. Yes, we like to have our way but everyone likes a challenge. He was also right about nightclubs and body language. If you don't get it - you won't get it! Overall, I think this guy knows what he's talking about. I think guys that read this book should be able to go out and get girls from it.</span>

                    <span>All I have to say is WOW!<BR>Amazing, efficient, introspective, pointed - this was an incredible book. I am actually inspired by this. I've never been more clear about the 'dating game' than I am now. I think this is one of those book that I'll keep referring to for years to come.</span>
