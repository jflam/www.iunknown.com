                    <span>I had the pleasure of being one of the technical editors for this book. It was my eleventh book edited. I've long since lost count of the number of technical books I've readm but this book stands out from among the others as one of the best I've ever seen. <P>It has a simple-sounding objective: to show how to do particular tasks. It came from the CCIE lab study notes of the authors. As such, it does not promise to explain theory or design. It just shows how to do something. <P>Want to configure "X"? Turn to the page and see the steps. It doesn't matter if "X" is dynamic access lists, NAT, DHCP, Frame Relay, DDR, HSRP or scores of other things - this book is the best "how-to" source I've ever come across.<P>If you are studying for a Cisco cert or just want a reference manual to help you through unfamiliar tasks at work, this is one of the must have books. I use it in my every day work and in my teaching. You will, too.</span>

                    <span>it doesn't explain it well. I can also use TAB and ? keys in the keyboard when I'm inside Cisco Router, better than using this book. What lacks here are sample configuration in a given situation or scenario, and more explanation of the commands and command options. What this book did was give the command and command options.<P>"Cisco Routers for IP Routing Little Black Book" by Innokenty Rudenko is still the best handbook, combine it with "Cisco Field Manual: Catalyst Switch Configuration" by Dave Hucaby, Stephen McQuerry, David Hucaby, and "Remote Access for Cisco Network" by Bill Burton, William Burton you are ready for the real-world task of configuring and troubleshooting Cisco Routers and Catalyst Switches.</span>

                    <span>The authors did a great job of presenting the relatively basic information on configuring Cisco routers. You will find quite a few useful IOS commands discussed in the book that will want to keep it as a handy reference. I would also suggest looking into getting "Cisco IOS for IP Routing" by Andrew Colton. That book would take you deeper into mechanics of modern routing protocols (EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP), along with a discussion of Cisco IOS commands.</span>

                    <span>This is a truly practical book. It features material most often configured on Cisco routers and gives the reader a step-by-step description of how to implement it. This is not a book for people seeking to learn networking, or the theory behind protocols and IOS features. It is just as the title says, a manual with "no nonsense" how-to's. A good quick reference when you don't have the Cisco documentation CD and need to implement something fast.</span>
                  
                    <div class="CustomerReviewSummary">Yup, it's EXCELLENT: tons of useful, practical stuff.</div>

                    <span>This is one of the more [dare I say "most"] USEFUL Cisco Press books. It mainly consist of the actually useful commands one would use in everyday work. Take a look at the TOC to see the WIDE variety of areas covered. [in my opinion:] Finally, must-buy from Cisco Press!</span>
