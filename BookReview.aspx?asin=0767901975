                    <span>I'm not a drinker and I'm learning to tend bar. This book not only supplies instructions for the various concoctions, but a little history of ingredients and a few famous quotes on the subject matter. Recommended by experienced bartender.</span>

                    <span>I bought 4 drink books over the holidays, because it seemed each had its strong points (Mr. Boston, Poister's New American Bartender's Guide, another one, and this one). This one I read the most by far. As far as this book goes, it is well-laid out, and entertaining just to flip through and read. Every other page has some kind of interesting drink-related quote or joke on it. The overall manner of this book is very friendly and informative, as opposed to certain other drink books. The type is large enough to read comfortably and the book is printed on high quality paper. An excellent choice if you're just buying one book. Has recipes for pretty much all the standard drinks you can think of. Doesn't have the number of different/crazy drinks like Poister's "New American...", but I find this book less snooty and more fun. Buy that one if you want more unusual drink variety. Mr. Boston is nice because it's hardbound & thorough as well, but they shamelessly self-promote their own liquor and liquor products, which annoys me. Buy this book if you're only going to buy one drink book, you probably won't be disappointed.</span>
