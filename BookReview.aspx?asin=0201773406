                    <span>These "Three Amigos"(Bruce Fraser, Chris Murphy, Fred Bunting) of color management, are the "desciples" of where color management is going. If you need color management(not everyone does)in your workflow, this is the book to get. From Photoshop to Quark, these "desciples of color management" cover it. They explain how we precieve color, not only from our eyes, but to our color monitors(display colors) to output devices(print colors). Whether it's for inkjet,cmyk or rgb output. This book explains how to build,evaluate and edit profiles. Even if you don't own(or don't want too) profiling software this book can be used to understand how color profiles(profiles in image-editing programs) can(and how)be used for color management systems and programs..... They explain the procedure of using color management for image-editing programs and operating systems. <BR> Their is a difference between "custom" and "canned" profiles(of course)and they explain the pros and cons of each. The book is written for getting the best out of using a color managed workflow. Whether you understand color management or not. This book will lead you to a better understanding of this subject.<P> John Opitz Photograpker</span>

                    <span>I've been actively reading on color and color management for a while now and I can tell that this book by Bruce, Chris and Fred is very authoritative and well written -- while being accessible technically. It encompasses about all of the important aspects of color and color management these days, it even gives lot's of OSX and Windows concrete examples with nice, sharp screen grabs. So much that anyone picking up a copy of this book and who's willing to spend a little bit of time reading, will be abundantly rewarded. Perfect for photographers, designers and prepress folks who want to keep abreast with the technology or want to explore the breadth of thie new fascinating concept. If you want to demystified modern digital color in Adobe's application (and Quark too) and get a feel for what a profiling application is and does, this is an excellent place to start. Even though I feel I am familiar with a lot of the notions these guys cover in their book, I know I am learning invaluable information by reading RWCM. It is time well spent. Congratulation guys on this monumental effort!</span>

                    <span>This is the most thorough, and easy-to-understand book on color management that I've ever seen. They start with some color theory, but don't bog down on the technical, like some other books I've seen. <P>They explain the color management and profile process, then tell you how to build profiles for various devices. They spend six (!) chapters on building and editing profiles. There are separate chapters for measurement & calibration, displays, input devices, output devices, etc. As an example, they cover the steps and procedures to profile RGB inkjet printers, CMYK inkjets, CMYK color lasers, CMYK solid inks, Dye-sub printers, and much more.<P>That process has always seemed like a bunch of mumbojumbo to me, but I found their explanations to be easy to follow. They explain the need for the right lighting in the room where you proof and print and how color shifts can occur.<P>Then, they deal with applications and workflow. Chapter twelve covers the Adobe Color architecture. subsequent chapters deal with separate apps like Freehand, Corel Draw, QuarkXPress and PDF. <P>They explain Colorsync and ICM color management systems. And there is a nice discussion about WHEN in the process to convert the color profile of an image.<P>The appendices have some very useful info on profiles and workflows.<P>It's a bit pricey, but if you NEED color management, it is worth it.</span>
