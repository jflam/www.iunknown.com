                <span id="Label1">Disciplines like strategy, leadership development, and innovation are the sexier aspects of being at the helm of a successful business; actually getting things done never seems quite as glamorous. But as Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan demonstrate in <i>Execution</i>, the ultimate difference between a company and its competitor is, in fact, the ability to execute. <p>  Execution is "the missing link between aspirations and results," and as such, making it happen is the business leader's most important job. While failure in today's business environment is often attributed to other causes, Bossidy and Charan argue that the biggest obstacle to success is the absence of execution. They point out that without execution, breakthrough thinking on managing change breaks down, and they emphasize the fact that execution is a discipline to learn, not merely the tactical side of business. Supporting this with stories of the "execution difference" being won (EDS) and lost (Xerox and Lucent), the authors describe the building blocks--leaders with the right behaviors, a culture that rewards execution, and a reliable system for having the right people in the right jobs--that need to be in place to manage the three core business processes of people, strategy, and operations. Both Bossidy, CEO of Honeywell International, Inc., and Charan, advisor to corporate executives and author of such books as <I>What the CEO Wants You to Know</I> and <I>Boards That Work</I>, present experience-tested insight into how the smooth linking of these three processes can differentiate one company from the rest. Developing the discipline of execution isn't made out to be simple, nor is this book a quick, easy read. Bossidy and Charan do, however, offer good advice on a neglected topic, making <I>Execution</I> a smart business leader's guide to enacting success rather than permitting demise. <I>--S. Ketchum</I> </span>

                    <span>From the beginner to the seasoned CEO, this book gives insight necessary to step up your game. There is a thin line between micro-managing and absolute execution. Bossidy and Charan help to make that line a little more clear. Delegating and following up has never been more clearly defined in respect to task completion on any level. This book serves as a guide to developing people in a culture of execution. I would have liked to have seen more information on the RIGHT things to do in situations where Bossidy and Charan pointed out what made a CEO not be successful. It could have become even more of a HOW TO book. It serves its purpose and I think that for the beginning manager, he/she should probably read "Who moved my Cheese?" in tandem with this book. </span>

                    <span>I devoured every page of this book because Bossidy knows how to convert business objectives into successes, and shows you how to do it.  I believe this book needs to be read in tandem with Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self because Optimal Thinking shows you how to make the most of your greatest asset (your mind) and any situation. Execution then puts Optimal Thinking into action to create optimum outcomes.  Make sure you give copies of these books to your employees.</span>

                    <span>Larry Bossidy's and Ram Charan's book "Execution" is a guide that helps leaders to be successful if they use a corporate strategy that focuses on the ability that is most essential to every business - to get things done.
<br />Bossidy and Charan forward the idea that execution is best achieved in a business setting through the three core processes of people, strategy, and operations. They argue that a leader must work closely with these three core processes in order to achieve execution and positive results. Therefore, this is not a book that explores individual execution as much as it instructs how a leader can get the most from their companies. 
<br />The writing is clear and simple. The book contains great details and energy to show how execution should be approached through people, strategy, and operations. In my opinion, it is great book for all struggling leaders and those who want to become great leaders. However, there are quite a few repetitions that make the book longer than it should be. Leaders could use that time on practicing execution instead of reading the same results again.

                    <span>While reading "Execution The Discipline of Getting Things Done," I kept waiting for the big insight - it never came. The book is written for higher level executives. But, if you have made it to that level, you probably don't need this book. The book could have been shorter, with the basic advice distilled rather than reiterated. I wanted some ways to lead a productive team and concrete ways to get things done. The "Letter to a New Leader" was the best part of the book. There are no references, which makes me think the authors did no research, or they feel their ideas are the only ideas. I think this lack of scholorship is one of the reasons the authors' content is so thin. I walked away hungry for more information and keener observations about execution. I had nothing to take back to the office with me after reading this book. </span>

                    <span>This book is a good insight into how these two men think execution is best accompished in a business. They forward the idea that execution is best achieved in a business setting through the three core processes of people, strategy, and operations. They argue that a leader must work closely with these three core processes in order to achieve execution and positive results. Therefore, this is not a book that explores individual execution as much as it instructs how a leader can get the most from their companies.
<br />The examples of Honeywell and Jack Welch flood the pages of this text. The authors succeed in demonstrating the necessity of working closely with the core processes, but they fail slightly in explaining the qualities and habits of a leader that is an executioner of his/her own right. If you are interested in building and making a business execute more, this book is for you. If you are intersted in executing more in your own life and becoming more effective, personally, this is not the best book--though may be slightly helpful. This is not a self-help but a business-help. 
<br />The writing is clear and simple. Great details and energy are employed to show how execution should be approached through people, strategy, and operations. It is not a page turner but is a great place to start for a struggling leader who wants to start getting things done.
