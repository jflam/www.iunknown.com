                    <span>This is a fascinating look into a dynamic woman's life.  There is a great deal of "personality" and drama in the seemingly mundane diary entries.  The author is truly gifted to have seen past the ho-hum recordings of daily life and pulled out the diary's real worth.  The midwife's live is rich, full, and busy!  However, the author weaves in plenty of historical background, too, using the diary as a stepping-off point to discuss local history, legal and social issues of the time, women's roles in economics, religion, etc. The book is quite enjoyable and allows the reader to connect with the past from a new angle.   <p>I have to include this note, though.  In some instances, the book is really quite academic.  I can imagine it being used to supplement a history or women's study class.  It is not a light biography, to curl up and relax with. But, don't let that put you off :-)!</span>

                    <span>I picked up Ulrich's book on Martha Ballard for background and to get a better sense of life in New England during this "Dark Age" of American genealogy research. My ancestors, especially the women, are lightly documented during this time period, their lives even less known than their husbands, brothers, and fathers. <p>Martha Ballard (unlike many women) moved around Hallowell, Maine--not across New England into New York and then to Ohio only to be buried at the end of an exhausting life with a wooden marker to mark her contribution. Martha stayed put and recorded her accounts, the weather, her exchanges with neighbors, births, deaths, and the sensational events of her day. Without Martha's record the vast majority of her neighbors and family would lost to history with no record of birth or death, let alone the homely remarks about the pain of losing a child or frustration with a son's less than ideal behavior.<p>This is a wonderful book, not just about Martha's life, but of her time. It helps describe the quality of life among people, their relationships, and interdependence with one another. It adds another dimension to what I understand about my New England antecedents. In particular, it adds hugely to my dim understanding of the shadowy figures of the women...in Martha, they come to life as strong, capable, and a vital part of life in New England. They are not the silent handmaidens of history. As Ulrich points out, without Martha's diary, even her first name might have been questioned by subsequent researchers--this is certainly the case of many women, whose identity became completely submerged in their husband's.<p>The historical research is excellent and well-documented. The writing is solid and communicates clearly without the dry, academic yawn factor. Ulrich presents her point, then supports it. From a historian, I expect no more...nor less. It's an outstanding read.</span>

                    <span>This book is more than just a women's history book.  So many issues and themes run tangential to Martha Ballard's diary that it can satisfy many different history buffs:  sexual mores, the transition of our nation from a colony to a country, domestic violence, everyday domestic chores and the difficulty of finding 'good help', infant mortality, town hierarchy and patriarchy, etc.  I really have to hand it to Prof. Ulrich, she had to dig deep and cross-reference other peoples' diaries and court records to catch the gist of Martha's euphemisms--especially when recounting the North-Foster rape trial or even noting when Martha was miffed with someone for a poor payment.  Then, there's the sticky fact that Martha's family was closely associated with Tories.  Again, Martha alludes to these issues indirectly but Prof. Ulrich really digs them out.  My only minor complaint is that the book was not written in a completely chronological fashion.  Nonetheless, it's engagingly written.</span>

                    <span>Thanks to gifted historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, I hear the voice of Martha Ballard as she goes about her productive, meaningful life in late 1700s Massachusetts. I also feel her shining, transcedent spirit nearby as I read. Martha's diary is filled with the cycle of neverending chores that still characterize the lives of women today. As caretakers, we cook, launder, clean, over and over again. Martha's diary also opens our eyes to the lot of our earlier sisters as they lived through (if fortunate, they lived) an 18-month to two year cycle of pregnancy, birth, and lactation. <br> <br>Martha ministers to them both in body and spirit; and the entire, closely bonded community of post-colonial wives and mothers is depicted in her story.<p>"I returned home at 10 hour morn, find my house alone and everything in Arms. Did not find time to still down till 2 pm." How this still resonates as women try combine work in the outside world with the unrelenting demands of domesticity!<p>Kudoes to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich for this brilliantly edited, extremely necessary part of American history---a woman's life as told by observant, compassionate, hard-working Martha Ballard.   Ulrich has included statistics of maternal and infant mortality that cause one to question the wisdom of  the "heroic intervention"  style of obstetrics that came later:  Martha experienced only about a 4% loss rate, which stands up impressively  until the days when antibiotics reduced the mortality rate to insignificance.</span>
