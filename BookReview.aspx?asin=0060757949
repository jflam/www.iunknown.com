                    <span>Three Super Bowl titles in four years:  The Patriots are obviously able to manage in the era of free agency and the salary cap better than any other team before them.  Unless you've been away in Antarctica for the last four years, you know how special Bill Belichick, Scott Pioli and the rest of the Patriots coaches and staff have been.  Match those resources with talented, dedicated athletes who want to win, and you have something special indeed.
<br />
<br />Shortly after February ends each year, I find myself yearning for more about the Patriots.  I look at the official Web site every day, read newspaper and magazine articles, watch replays of the past season . . . and pine for more.
<br />
<br />I was glad that I had saved Patriot Reign to help me get through the never-ending off season until training camp opens and I can again sit on the sunny hillside at Gillette Stadium and watch my favorite team run its drills.
<br />
<br />Michael Holley was one of my favorite sportswriters at the Boston Globe during the years he was there.  His columns about the Celtics lifted a mediocre team into deliciously interesting scrutiny.  That made this book an even more "must read" event for me. 
<br />
<br />As you probably know, the Patriots (and especially their coach) are notoriously tight-lipped.  Who would have thought that they would open their doors to a sportswriter to follow them around for two seasons?  Well, that's what happened.
<br />
<br />As a result of that unparalleled access, we get a sense of the private Belichick as he steals a few hours here and there to be with his parents and family, we see the Patriots operate their successful 2003 draft in real time, we find out how Scott Pioli co-exists between two tough men (Coach Belichick and Scott's father-in-law, Bill Parcells), and we get a sense of how game plans are prepared and adjusted during the course of a game.  It's overwhelming to realize how much this organization takes on in pursuit of winning.  At the same time, we feel their pain when the 2002 season has more than its share of hiccups, when Coach Belichick is insulted on national television after the Lawyer Milloy release ("They hate their coach"), and as trusted veterans reel at the realization that no one is safe from the need to constantly upgrade the player organization. 
<br />
<br />You also find out that the approach behind the scenes can be brutally frank and profane.  That won't surprise you, but it will make you realize what it takes to produce all those wins that we all appreciate so much.
<br />
<br />The book has some serious weaknesses though.  Michael Holley doesn't seem to understand football as well as his does basketball.  As a result, his capturing of the coaching and managing process involved is a little more general than a passionate Patriots fan would like to read.  I would have liked to see more context about how other good coaches do it.  
<br />
<br />The book could have been written by anyone up until about the middle of the text . . . when the 2002 season opens.  The book would have been better if it was shorter up to that point.
<br />
<br />Naturally, the story finishes incomplete . . . without the astonishing season in 2004-2005 when the Patriots won back-to-back Super Bowl titles.  What was different about this season from 2002?  Inquiring minds want to know, but those minds will have to guess.
<br />
<br />If you have favorite players who you just cannot learn enough about, you will be somewhat disappointed in the book.  Players don't show up much in the text.  This is a book that's more about coaching and management than a player's eye-view of the games.   
<br />
<br />I hope that Mr. Holley will write a new edition to this book, or a sequel, that adds on the last season.  In addition, I hope he will write a book seeing these remarkable years from the players' viewpoints as well.  For instance, Troy Brown, who has done so much for the Patriots, is no longer a Patriot.  His story alone would make for a remarkable book.</span>

                    <span>As a lifelong Patriot's fan, please excuse me if I wax poetic about this book and this team.  But this book is one of the best sports books I have read. Michael Holley has succeeded in writing a straight forward book, which seemingly pulls no punches and has changed the way I view the owners of the Patriots, the coaching staff and the players.    Michael Holley uses a simple colorful prose (be prepared for some realistic but graphic language from players and coaches (I would think twice before handing this to someone under the age of 14 or even older)) in a fast reading book that makes you wish he had waited to include one more season before sending it to print.  The book reminds me of a roller coaster, where much of the ride is a steady climb but punctuated by dramatic and thrilling wild rides.  My only complaint is that a reader who is not familiar with some of the names in the book will never understand the characters as well as someone who has followed the sport and the team.  In essence, some level of knowledge of the people and the plays is assumed.  But do not under any circumstance use this as a reason not to read the book.
<br />
<br />If you follow the Patriots, be prepared to relive the best of times and the worst of times as if you were there again.  If you do not follow the Patriots, the wisdom imparted through this book is invaluable.  Besides having the best recount of the Patriots/Rams Superbowl game I have ever read, I learned lessons from this book that I will apply to my work and to my family.  The first lesson is that the support of family and friends is critical to providing a solid foundation on which to build excellence.  Beyond that, however, this book reveals that Coach Belichick has the unusual ability to take complicated situations which appear unmanageable and boil them down to the basics where they can be managed.  This is a skill we all could use.  Be prepared to read a book about a team that reached higher than anyone thought they could and acheived what few teams will ever achieve forever changing football.  </span>

                    <span>I thought Michael Holley's description of a team that had so many losing and dysfuncitonal seasons, to becoming the model NFL franchise, was truly terrific. It is a great easy to read book for those who don't read much and it provides a lot of behind the scenes stuff that you wouldn't find in any other analysis of how the team functions.
<br />
<br />It shows how everything in a franchise needs to be in order to have sucess; from a smart owner who knows that the key to success is communication with the coach, to the genius coach and his assistants who come up with mastermind schemes and motivational techniques, to the exceptionally intelligent players who may not be superstars but are supremely good 'football players', even down to the scouts and the combnines.
<br />
<br />This is a must read for any Patriots fan and any football fan for that matter. Awesome book.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed reading this book. Holley has a smooth easy writing style and doesn't get bogged down in retelling every detail. After reading this book I have a much better sense of why the Patriots are so successful.  I loved the antidote about Belichick and Tom Jackson.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Holley's book is better, for my money, than the typical "In Week 5, this happened, and then in Week 6 that happened" blow-by-tedious-blow chronology. I enjoyed "Patriot Reign" and learned a few new insiders-only facts about my favorite team. The Patriots granted Holley special behind-the-scenes access, and he reveals some previously private details of the Patriots operation, so I definitely give his book a "thumbs up" for Patriots fans. However, I do have some criticisms of this book:
<br />
<br />First, I was bothered by the constant swearing. Of course NFL coaches swear a lot. We all know that. So that point could have been made more subtly. Instead, it seemed that every third quotation had a swear word in it. I appreciate and enjoy verbatim quotations, but why not use "[darn]" or something that makes clear that a swear word was used?
<br />
<br />Second, and far more serious than the swearing, is Holley's verbatim repeating of coaches' unvarnished analyses of particular Patriots players and his naming of those players. Again, we know that the Patriots coaching staff forces itself to evaluate each player objectively. Holley quotes Larry Cook saying "You've got to be cruel at times." That's great. We get the point. Sentimentality plays no role in player evaluations. Patriots coaches are brutally honest. But Holley didn't stop there. He gave details embarrassing to particular players and named those players. Holley repeats, word-for-word, some brutal statements on p. 142 about a particular player whom I won't name here. I was astounded after Holley's book's publication that that player said all the right things to the media. Holley's revelations might have torn a weaker organization apart. To the Patriots, however, this book's bombshells proved just another opportunity to display their astounding ability to overcome adversity. Nevertheless, Holley probably should not have printed the entire swear word when a coach said, "I can't stand the mother----." And naming that player was cruel. Why not simply call him "Player X"?
<br />
<br />Third, there's no index. It's possible that later editions have one, but my "first edition" does not.
<br />
<br />Fourth, Bill Belichick's Patriots are such a tremendous organization that I believe this book regrettably undershot its potential for extracting lessons of widespread relevance and applicability in businesses and organizations everywhere. This book's subject is so compelling and interesting that it could have been a truly "great" book, rather than the "good" to "very good" book I believe it is. (I am obviously biased, but I believe my book, "Management Secrets of the New England Patriots," achieves what Holley's book might have.)
<br />
<br />I generally agree with Holley's analysis and enjoy his insider insights. But I am disturbed by his failure to exercise journalistic discretion. He could have filtered his raw information to make his points without needlessly embarrassing particular individuals. Nevertheless, "Patriot Reign" is a very good book for Patriots fans.</span>
