                <span id="Label1"><p>Now in its 15th edition, this classic movie reference, formerly known as <i>The Filmgoer's Companion</i>, has informed and delighted film fans for more than thirty years. Opinionated, witty, and packed with more information per square inch than any other film guide, <i>Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies</i> is as wonderfully unclassifiable as it is impossible to put down.</p> <p>Who's Who remains a treasure trove of information on who's who and what's what in the movies. Its more than 12,000 entries illuminate the stars of yesterday and today as well as the bit players and character actors, directors, producers, writers, cinematographers, composers, and all the other talent involved in making movies. You'll find sections on movie sequels, series, and remakes; themes and genres; technical terms; studios and production companies; cinema around the world; year-by-year listings of Oscar winners and other major awards; and a brief history of the movies from Chaplin to Carrey, Garbo to Kidman, Capra to Cameron.</p> <p>This updated edition features hundreds of new entries and offers scores of "quotable quotes," ranging from the revealing to the revolting; in addition to being exceedingly entertaining, they add a human dimension missing from every other guide to film facts and figures. Upholding the outstanding tradition of Leslie Halliwell, editor John Walker delivers the lively humor and keen insight that have always been the hallmarks of Halliwell's.</p></span>

                    <span>Unlike the excellent yearly "Halliwell's Film and Video Guide" "Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies" is a serious disappointment. True, there are more than 12,000 bios, but practically all of the biographical entries are taken up by a list of films with little actual biographical information. <P> For a director as important as Fran√ßois Truffaut the entire article consists solely of (1) the dates of birth and death; (2) the statement: "French 'new wave' director, former critic. Died of a brain tumour."; (3) the titles of his supposed autobiography and his book on Hitchcock; (4) the film list (UK titles only); and (5) two short quotes by Truffaut. I write "supposed autobiography" because the cited work is, in fact, not an autobiography at all but a collection of Truffaut's early film criticism. This makes one suspicious of other information in "Halliwell's Who's Who." <P>This inaccurate and stingy bio of Truffaut in "Halliwell's Who's Who" should be compared with the detailed bio in Ephraim Katz' "The Film Encyclopedia," where approximately 1000 words are devoted to his biography in addition to the complete list of his films (with both the US and French titles). Katz has had to limit the number of bios (about 7000 compared to Halliwell's 12,000) in order to be able to offer really useful information. I think his trade-off has been well judged.<P>For some film makers the biography in "Halliwell's" (apart from the film list) may be limited to two words, such as "American director." Eric Rohmer's bio is limited to a single smug and mildly insulting remark: "French director of rarefied conversation pieces." Robert Bresson fares little better. At the same time, UK directors like Ken Loach or Lindsay Anderson, worthy men indeed but whose importance is certainly far less than Truffaut's, receive extensive bios and a great many quotes. <P>There are about 120 pages of appendices in "Halliwell's Who's Who," many of which are both useful and unique to that publication. If you already own Ephraim Katz' "The Encyclopedia of Film" there is little reason to purchase "Halliwell's Who's Who in Film," except maybe for some of these appendices, an expensive purchase. On the other hand, if you already own "Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies," there is every reason to purchase Katz' encyclopedia.</span>

                    <span>Though advertised as a continuation (i.e. 14th Edition)of the "Filmgoers companion" it is only a list of people in the movies. Gone are Halliwell's definitions of movie tradecraft and lists of themes, individual classics and personal notes. A fine actor like Lee J. Cobb gets a single line, while Jayne Mansfield, known more for her off screen antics, gets many more. The quotes from the movie personalities is a nice touch, but when I look up somebodies filmography I do not want to see etc. at the end of an incomplete list.</span>

                    <span>Leslie Halliwell(1929-1989) was the publisher of this informative and extremely enjoyable reference book on many of the cinema's most influental figures. What sets Halliwell's great book apart from the others is that it includes not only the most famous of today and yesterday's stars/writers/producers/directors, but a great many obscure, but no less important names in the industry as well. Halliwell's book is also unique in that it includes a list of technical terms that are extremely vital in the motion picture industry, as well as a list of popular film series, and a complete list of Academy Award winners. Whether you are looking to be informed or entertained, Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies serves both purposes well, and is a compulsive read guaranteed to give die-hard film buffs hours and hours of endless reading pleasure. The book, formerly known as The Filmgoer's Companion, is actually a companion piece to an older favorite, Halliwell's Film Guide, also strongly recommended for the serious film buff.</span>

                    <span>This volume was titled "The Filmgoer's Companion" but this year changed to "Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies". Personally, I like the former title better. Fortunately, this is still the same book in regard to content. It has some great quips and quizzes for those movie buffs out there and great references for more obscure work that some of these actors/actresses/producers and directors did. Well worth the price!</span>
