                <span id="Label1">When Harold Payson--known to associates, friends, and his wife as Dynamite--began supplementing his boatbuilding work by selling boat plans, he got feedback from a number of customers who found the boats too difficult to build. Selling plans for boats that never got built went against Dynamite's Down East grain, and it was also, he figured, "a straight road to bankruptcy in the long run." He outlined the problem to Philip Bolger, arguably the most innovative small-craft designer around, and Bolger agreed, on one condition, to design a series of that would require no lofting, no jig, and no lumber that could not be obtained at any local building supplies store. The one condition was that Dynamite would build and thoroughly test a prototype of each design to wring out every bug before offering the plans for sale. The eventual result was the original fleet of six boat described in his first book, <i>Instant Boats</i>. <p>Here are eleven new Instant Boats to choose from, including three built with a new tack-and-tape method that eliminates most beveling. There are complete building instructions and plans for the Gypsy, a 15-foot, double-chine outboard speed boat; Windsprint, a 16-foot, double-ended, lug-rigged sharpie; and others. (Full-size plans are available from the author; you can build directly from the book, but the purchase of larger-scale plans will make the task of scaling off the patterns easier.)  </span>

                    <span>If you follow the directions you can see success in a short amount of time if you choose a boat suiting your skill level. There are many boats presented here and not all are for the first time builder with limited skill. ANYONE can build a Tortoise (Basically all straight cuts and little in the way of wood is required its a two 4x8 sheet boat). I don't see spending [money]on those materials. I live in Southern California too ant materials can be expensive but please! There are more than a few people who have built boats from this book! Just know your limits and what kind of success you desire. Start reasonable and this is a great book to get you there. I can't think of any book that can get you there easier. This book is not outdated or hard to understand. Read and re-read it, then get to work.</span>

                    <span><P> When you combine the building genius and straight-forward writhing style of Harold Payson with the amazing, easy to build marine designs of the notable Phil Bolger, You have a sure winner!<P> The book combines general technical knowledge on boatbuilding with a large assortment of plans. This book allows you to build everything from a six foot row/sail boat, aptly named the tortise, to a classic looking, incredibly fast 25 foot schooner, simply called 'scooner'.   <P> It is written with the beginner in mind, giving only small ammounts of technical information. The construction methods are virtually fool proof, and you can emerge from your workshop in a weekend with a complete boat, ready for the water.</span>

                    <span>I bought the book, [followed the author's advice and] bought plans from him, and have built two of his boats. One serves as a tender on my larger Bolger boat, a role it has played without complaint for three years. The other I gave to a friend so she'd learn to sail (Success!). These boats are not classics, but they WORK! Dynamite Payson shows you how to make a proper, safe little boat, based on the designs of Phil Bilger. For inspiration I'd recommend Phil Bolger's book "Boats with an Open Mind".</span>

                    <span>I had suddenly decided to build a boat, and ordered a set of 6 books. This was the first to arrive and I have mixed feelings about it. The book is great, it tells you all about the materials you CAN find in your area rather than things you cant find. It tries to simplify building processes as much as possible and the designs seem to be truly within my reach.<P>The problem is that the book assumes that you know all the boat terms, I grew up in the desert, we barely know there is something called a boat in existence. Now I buy this book and uses all sorts of nautical terms. I can tell that if I knew what these terms meant, I could have actualy done something about it.</span>

                    <span>A great book about simple, straight forward boatbuilding. The author presents information and designs on building boats using a tack and tape method and a more convential framing method. I've built one boat from this book and am starting a second one. Payson's boatbuilding information or Bolger's designs alone are worth the price of this book.<P>I have to take to task the two reviewers who have indicated this book short changed them. For starters, I think the author is an honest person. In one reviewers case, the problem is a lack of plans. I've bought plans for both the boats I built because it makes building easier. For both boats, the plans were in the book. This is generous of the author considering he earns some income from plan sales. In the second case, materials price seems to be the problem. The book was published in '85, so some inflation should be allowed for. Even so, for half of his total investment, the materials for that particular boat could have been bought including epoxy adhesive and bronze oar fittings. The author also points the several levels of materials that can be used to build these boats, explaining how this affects the finished boat. Another thing the author points out is that boatbuilding takes imagination and perserverance. A lack of both of thse traits is the real problem facing the two reviewers.<P>If you want to build a Bolger instant boat, this book is great to have on hand. The author helped work the bugs out of these designs. You can't get better help than that.</span>
