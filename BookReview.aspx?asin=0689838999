                <span id="Label1">The ingenious Robert Sabuda returns for yet another inspired pop-up  book, a follow-up to <I>The 12 Days  of Christmas</I> and <I>The  Christmas Alphabet</I>, that retells Clement Clarke Moore's classic yuletide  rhyme. <p>  Sabuda remains a master of the medium, constructing a series of varied and  well-engineered scenes: Santa pops in and out of the chimney, beds fold out, a  window shade rises and falls, and, in a clever nod to Moore's  not-a-creature-was-stirring text, it's a family of <I>mice</I> who are receiving  Santa's nighttime visit. A pull-out tab even lets readers interact, when Santa's  sleigh glides out on the clouds and over an intricately realized village. It's  hard to pick a favorite scene here, but you can bet that kids will love the  book's <I>pop de r&#233;sistance</I>, in which Santa's lead reindeer nearly fly right  up your nose (if they don't knock you out of your chair first).<p>  The book's first-rate production and lively pop-ups are enough to recommend it,  but Sabuda goes one better by showing the thoughtful restraint to make most of  the pop-ups almost entirely white. A few accents of color catch your eye  (Santa's red suit and silver pipe), but--as befits such a dynamic book--the  visual focus stays on the action. (All ages) <I>--Paul Hughes</I></span>

                    <span>THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS is this year's Sabuda masterpiece to be added to his growing list of amazing works. To go along with Clement Moore's famous poem, Sabuda gives us eleven gorgeous, complex pop-ups that really DO pop up. At the same time, it's really rather elegant. Most of the pop-ups are in simple white with silver embellishments. This is SO much fun! Santa and the reindeer quite literally jump right out at you. Look for subtle things, like the minute hand moving on the clock, and the window shade going up. And at the end you get a whole little village. WARNING: This book is NOT toddler-proof. This is a work of art. By all means, share it with the children. They'll love it! But keep it just far enough away from their eager fingers. Do NOT miss this one!</span>

                    <span>A got started on collecting pop-up books when I encountered a book by Robert Sabuda called "Twelve days of Christmas". It was an astounding book, quite unusual in that it was mostly white. The engineering was amazing. That book led me to buy and collect pop books of which Robert Sabuda's books occupy a high place indeed. His work stands out due to its complexity and yet has the ability to surprise and delight. Each popup in this book is nigh near what is impossible to do out of paper and yet he has done it. The last scene with the little village spread out in a snowy wonderland is a treasure. I will have to buy an another book, just so I can put one away and have one to look at admire and play.</span>

                    <span>I thought this would be a fun way to share "The Night Before Christmas" poem with my 9-year old. The folks who were fascinated by the engineering and awed by the complexity of the pop-ups were my husband and I! This is a keeper, and a great classic Christmas present to give to adults with a sense of whimsy.</span>

                    <span>We bought this book for xmas for my 6 year old. She thought it was neat the way the pictures popped out, but some of the stuff was so glued and folded that the image would get stuck and not pop like it should. We struggled trying to get Santa and the reindeers to circle the village in the last few pages. It was frustrating that not every image worked like it should. Otherwise it was a decent xmas book.</span>
