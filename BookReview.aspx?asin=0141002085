                <span id="Label1">Drawing upon forty years of experience from his own sports and celebrity management practice, Mark H. McCormack is back with common-sense advice aimed at business owners and would-be CEOs. McCormack's tips include: <br><br> * End your day on time<br> * People who say they can keep a secret usually can't<br>  * It pays to overestimate your competition<br> * The best ideas cannot be stolen<br> * Know when to say "It's none of your business"<br> * Get paid for thinking rather than doing<br> * Time in front of the customer is the best time of all<br> * Be wary of unanimous agreement<br> * Not every budget deserves your respect<br> * Learn the art of picking up the check<br> <br><br> In ninety brief chapters that range in topic from getting ahead to staying competitive, McCormack makes clear that doing business in today's climate still involves the same basic elements of human interaction-intelligence, creativity, and efficiency-that have always meant the difference between success and failure.</span>

                    <span>I started reading business books with Mark McCormack's "What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School" years ago. So, I couldn't resist "Never Wrestle with a Pig," and am glad I picked it up. McCormack reminds us of the fundamentals and basic goals of business in order to succeed and prosper - whether today, tomorrow or way back in the 20th Century. I'm done wrestling with pigs, but I am going to give humans in business more chances with my refreshed knowledge from McCormack. It's a quick read with long-lasting benefits.</span>

                    <span>I usually tend to find career development/strategy books simplistic and mind-numbing. After having my attention caught by the title of this book though, I decided to give it a try. I couldn't put it down and have already recommended it to many people. The format is very reader-friendly with McCormack's having done a great job of packaging his points in morsels that are easy to absorb. You'll probably find yourself nodding in agreement with his bits of common sense as you're reading. It's the kind of book that you want to share with everyone, but on the other hand keep it to yourself because what you learn from this book will make you appear like a genius. The only detraction from the material is that the author does come off as pompous at times, but looking at his accomplishments, I think this attitude is warranted.</span>

                    <span>The book was quite clear and informative. It had many experiences that were shared and communicated well. It did give me many interesting tid bits and pointers, but -<P>I started to get the feeling that the author was really full of himself, and it seemed after a while that he kept saying: "only after I stepped in did things improve most of the time because I am such a smart guy..."<P>That started to wear me down and it started to get a little annoying. If it wasnt for that, the book was good. <P>I would not recommend this book to any friend of mine because I think there are other books out there that tell the reader more with less personal glory attached to it. <P>Perhaps I should read biographies more?</span>
