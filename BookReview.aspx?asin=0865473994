                    <span>The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma
<br />
<br />This is a very worthwhile contribution to the literature of "enlightenment". The book covers 4 items: Outline of Practice; Bloodstream Sermon; Wake-up Sermon & Breakthrough Sermon. By far the most interesting are the Bloodstream & Wake-up Sermons. The 4th item is of marginal interest since it simply presents a more or less standard view of the Mahayana Dharma in relation to mind and form. The wake-up sermon provides many clues for use by the "somnambulant" designed to make them aware of their status and the Bloodstream contains useful viewpoints concerning states of mind.
<br />Perhaps the most striking thing about these two chapters (shorn of Buddhist terminology) is the extent to which the material parallels comments made by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. There is the same sense of spontaneity and freedom about the statements and it makes one wonder why the last chapter of the book is so different from the others. It is almost as it the last chapter represents the tendering of Bodhidharma's dues to the Mahayana group with which he was associated and, in turn perhaps he was permitted to teach a Dharma based almost exclusively on his own insights. Who is to know?
<br />Highly recommended, 5 stars.

                    <span>If you haven't noticed by now, truth is not exempt from change. This wonderful traslation of some of the core teachings of the credited founder of Zen, Bodhidharma, makes this very clear to me. Everytime I read this tremedously important work new insight comes forward, making clear how the "way" is never locked in place. Not to mention this is one of very few books out there in English which gives an account of some of this famous master's teachings. <p>If you read this book with a sincere effort to realize this life, it will no doubt give you what you came for. As for a book of mere entertainment, this is not that. It is thought provoking, the meanings of every page are not spoonfed to us. We are left to search for their meanings within on our own, Red Pine simply tries to present us with the original sayings. Commentary can often confuse someone into believing that the observation an uthor makes is one and the same with what was originally said. I like how Red Pine does not do this. I believe the best translator's try their best to present us with the closest accounts as possible of what the original work was about. I believe Red Pine has certainly done this.<p>Enjoy this book:)</span>

                    <span>I sincerely repent of my previous review which slandered these wondrous tracts. I was foolish and heedless in doing so.  Suffice to say, if you want to get the jist of what Zen is outside of the "Ah, how pretty the trees in Oneness." Buy this book and some of the others by Thomas Cleary. They're all quite nice.</span>

                    <span>Red Pine (aka Bill Porter, author of ROAD TO HEAVEN and a celebrated translator of Buddhist poetry and scripture) gives us a spirited translation of four talks attributed to Bodhidharma even though debates over authorship, and even the existence of Bodhidharma as more than a legend, have not rested.<p>Bodhidharma's "Outline of Practice" outlines the dharma as this Brahman-born monk taught it in China after being sent there by his teacher, Prajnatara.  A confusing distinction made in these talks, especially the "Outline," has to do with what Bodhidharma calls "reason" (again, in this translation) and meditation practice.  They are presented as two avenues to "zen," but the definitions make it hard to distinguish them.  Throughout, there is an inside/outside (or mind/body) kind of thinking which may be expedient thinking for the sake of his students, or his own enduring mind-habit.<p>Otherwise, his teaching is very clear: attain your true self, attain what the Heart Sutra is talking about; and at that point, what is there to do?  Realizing the paramitas without a trace of actor or action, the student can use form with a clear mind and help others.<p>In the "Bloodstream Sermon," there are questions and answers, as Bodhidharma teaches and occasionally spars with monks in China (at a time when Buddhism in China was heavily philosophical).  Bodhidharma has mastered the philosophy enough to turn it on its ear and make it point these sleepy students to "just doing it."  If you do not find your true self, he says, all invocations, offerings and precepts are useless.  "The thousands of sutras and shastras only amount to a clear mind."<p>With the "Breakthrough Sermon," the conceptualizing gets pretty convoluted.  Dharma speeches are like acupuncture needles, and what may have pointed directly 1,500 years ago becomes mysterious.  This talk refers to the Nirvana Sutra and the Sutra of the Ten Stages, which were revolutionizing Buddhism in China.  <p>It is interesting to watch how Bodhidharma intercepts questions which are often reverently Buddhist and spin them around to the three poisons (anger, greed, delusion) and their need to practice just now.  And yet one might wonder that even as he criticizes external devotions, he seems to be making something special about "inner" work and enlightenment.  Is there such thing as practice without inside and outside?</span>
