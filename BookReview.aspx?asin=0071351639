                <span id="Label1">Telephony can be confusing, particularly to people who have spent the  bulk of their careers on data networking technologies. <I>The New McGraw-Hill  Telecom Factbook</I> explains telephone technologies clearly and in detail, with  the goal of providing essential and background information to readers who need  to buy and manage telecommunications products and services. This book covers  relevant technologies, naturally, but also recognizes that commercial and  regulatory considerations have significant effects on telecommunications. It's  an informative and readable snapshot of the telecommunications industry at the  turn of the millennium.<p>  As a rule, telephony is explained in terms of its general concepts, which helps  offset the tendency here to refer to North American carriers, trade names, and  laws in examples. You'll find plenty of formulas, and sample calculations  enhance their value. Instead of just stating the Erlang-C formula, for example,  the book shows how to analyze a call center's load pattern for purposes of  provisioning equipment. <I>Telecom Factbook</I> also distinguishes itself from  other general telecommunications texts with its detailed comparisons of  competing technologies. Usually, you'll find descriptions of each technology  that fits a given need, plus supporting conceptual diagrams. Grids help clarify  the technologies' relative strengths, too. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Data and (especially) voice communications, discussed in  a detailed survey form that's ideal for engineers who are exploring alternative  solutions, as well as for managers. Coverage includes the standards (both de  facto and de jure) that govern equipment, plus the commercial and legal  restrains that color the telecommunications environment further.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be invaluable as a comprehensive source of information about telecommunications networks and related subjects. Unlike many other texts, this book does not assume that the reader is a consultant in the industry or has a strong engineering background. Even the choice of each chapter subject is carefully thought out so as to save the time and effort required of the businessperson who needs focused knowledge quickly. Pecar and Garbin do a great service by providing an outline, or basis for research of the expansive technologies and practical and historical approaches to the challenge of telecommunications. This book will see a lot of use in my office.. if I can keep it there.. It usually ends up in somebody elses!.</span>

                    <span>This insightful work brings the divergent worlds of voice and data together.  It provides a clear view of converging information technologies and implications for business processes. The Factbook is an indispensable guide to sound management decision-making.<p>Our telecommunications group has adopted the Factbook as its principal desk reference.  And when it's needed, it's needed badly, so we each have a copy.<p>The Factbook is our go-to survival tool in today's information network jungle!...</span>

                    <span>Pecar and Garbin have the rare ability to convey a complex technical subject in an easy to understand manner.  The New Telecom Factbook can be read from cover to cover, piecemeal, or be used simply as a reference manual. This book weaves the confluence of Telecom Network Architecture, Technology, Regulation, and Services into a story of amazing clarity.  If you need to rapidly come up to speed in Telecom, I highly recommend this book.  If you are getting started in Optical Networking this book will be an important tool to help you place the optical build-out into perspective. I enjoyed reading this book and will refer to it often. -Brad Boersen, MIT System Design and Management Program</span>
