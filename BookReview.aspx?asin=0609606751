                <span id="Label1">"A room may be crammed with hideous furniture, be painted in shrieking shapes or have the sort of patterned carpet that makes you feel giddy, but you have to rise above this and see only the structure that lies underneath," says decorator Nina Campbell. In <I>Nina Campbell's Decorating Secrets</I>, the acclaimed British interior designer takes you through the most integral steps of home decorating, room by room. <p> Nina Campbell's signature design is "layering," which means every element--the furniture, wall coverings, carpet, lighting, accessories--should complement each other and the overall scheme of the room. She starts with the hall, the first impression of your home, then moves into the drawing and sitting rooms, the dining room, the kitchen, the study and library, the bedrooms, and then the bathrooms. Campbell uses her own home and other posh London residences as her examples, but you may not have this many rooms, the wallet, or the will to acquire them; however, you can still come away with ideas for your own home. The style she prefers is lush, rich, and elegant but some may find a Campbell-decorated home overstuffed and ornate. Whether or not you're a fan of chintz, you can still find inspiration from her thoughtful process, her emphasis on harmony between function and aesthetics, and her insistence on a comfortable home in which you can have both private retreats and areas for entertaining. "Your home is an extension of your personality," she says, "and it is this that you want to capture when putting your decorative scheme together." <I>--Dana Van Nest</I> </span>

                    <span>I just started reading decorating books and so far this has been the best one. It gives advice on what you need to think about before decorating and the specific elementS a room needs to successfull. This book gives you the underlying principles that can be applied to many differnt styles.</span>

                    <span>English designer Nina Campbell has rewarded us with yet another piece de resistance. Brimming with sumptuous photographs (all of which left me salivating), this book has quickly become my perennial favorite. DECORATING SECRETS is robust in every area, not just a few, and seems to appeal to a wide audience. <P>This book is more than just tassels and fluff. Firstly, Nina makes it clear that she is a traditionalist. "...I am not advocating the minimalist approach - anyone who knows my look would realize how alien that is to me..." Secondly, her sage advice is for appropriate for every designer, regardless of budget limitations. If the photographs are not your speed, then pay strict attention to her words, you can adapt the ideas presented to a home of any size.<P>In essence, what makes this book stand out head and shoulders above the others is the combination of Nina's elegant writing, her down-to-earth presentation, inspiring ideas and -- the details, details, details! She deftly explains what a novice designer needs to know before tackling a project, and then walks through the process room by room. She also addresses small spaces, a topic usually covered under separate titles. Most of the photographs are close-ups, which enables readers to catch specific details and replicate the looks most inspiring to them.<P>If you are confused by the myriad of decorating books on the market today, and are looking for that one book that you can use over and over again as a quick reference guide, this is one I would recommend hands down. I also suggest that you check out Nina's other book entitled The Art of Decoration. My copy is two years old and very tattered.<P>Cris Cunningham</span>

                    <span>I TRY to live like this. Part of the art of living beautifully is hiding and improving the not-so-beautiful. Nothing fancy about that. If you're as tired of pictures of spare, beige rooms as I am, this is a wonderful book, full of color and elegance and a variety of styles in an English context. There is a far wider scope of styles and accessories than in many design books, and the use of international motifs and accessories always fascinates me. If you like layers, color, and variety in a traditional to transitional style, this is a beautiful and educational read.</span>

                    <span>I think if your decorating style is very "over the top" Brittish Proper, you may like this book. While I liked looking through this book one or two times, it is not one that I take off the shelf for inspiration very often. I didn't find any "secrets" on decorating in this book - except for putting fringe and tassles along the ceilings and in corners - YUCK! It is a book with pictures and tips you would expect to find in a five dollar magazine.</span>
