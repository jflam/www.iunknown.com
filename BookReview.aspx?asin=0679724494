                    <span>I saw the movie, KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN several years ago and fell in love with it, but I'd never read the book until last week. As wonderful as the movie is, for me, the book is even better. I was fascinated by this story from the very first page and that fascination only grew until I reached the book's surprising end. <P>KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN begins as a character study of two very different cell mates in an Argentine prison. Molina is a former window dresser who deals with life's uncertainties by escaping into fantasy via his love for the cinema. Valentin, a political revolutionary, is very much the opposite and appears, at first, to be well-grounded in reality. Gradually, however, the two men find common ground and their relationship deepens into something both lasting and life-changing. <P>By the time I got around to reading this book, I'd forgotten much of the film's plot, especially its ending. I was fascinated with the interplay between Molina and Valentin and absolutely mesmerized by the twist Puig gives their relationship...not once...but twice. This story ends on a surprising (at least for me) note, but one that "fits" perfectly. KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN is the kind of book you can't put down until you reach the end and after you do, the story stays with you. It lingers, ensaring you in its web. <P>The bulk of KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN is written in dialogue. Any description of the prisoners's surroundings (or of Molina and Valentin, themselves) is left to the reader's imagination. I know some readers may not agree with or like this choice, but I thought it was perfect. This is very definitely a character-driven novel (and a claustrophobic one at that) as opposed to a plot-driven one and telling the story through dialogue only deepens and enriches our insight into the psyche of the two men involved. <P>I loved KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN. It's not upbeat and it won't make you feel good, but it is luminous and mesmerizing from the first page to the last. Puig's style differs greatly from that of other great Latin American writers, but he's just as important and just as influential. This is one novel I think everyone should read.</span>

                    <span>This book was recommended to my by a very enthusiastic friend, and I must say, having finished the book, I understand why. Roughly, the story is about two men in prison: Luis Molina, the homosexual window dresser, and Valentin Arruiga Paz. That, however, only begins to describe it. It's also about movies: Molina tells the plots of movies, partially to pass the time, partially because these movies -- living these movies -- is his escape. He prefers the movies from the forties and fifties, with the real divas, short hair, lots of blood-red lipstick . . . The movies aren't just time-passers, either: they reflect the events of the book.<P>The style is one of the most outstanding features of the book. It is almost entirely in dialogue, with some brief spates into play-format and a couple of police reports. It varies with the setting. There are also a couple of sections in stream-of-consciousness, where one receives Molina's movies as he thinks of them, no bothering with sentences. It all contributes to a wonderful effect.<P>I have, however, heard, that although this is the only translation available, it isn't the best. For example, Molina refers to himself as a woman throughout the book in the Spanish version. Although this isn't as possible in English, one could have made more of an effort, to preserve the feel of the original.<P>So go learn Spanish (if you don't know it already) -- but read this first!</span>

                    <span>Since there are already so many reviews for this excellent book, I will limit my contribution to a few comments on the footnotes. They are not mere postmodern flourish, nor are they superfluous. They function in several ways. First, they mark a certain reception of psychoanalytic theory in Argentina. Secondly, although in the beginning they correspond to the story (in the tradition way that footnotes do -- as elaboration on a point that cannot be contained in the narrative) they begin to loose their direct correspondence as the story continues. This "unraveling" corresponds to the unraveling of the framing device (most importantly the telling of stories), which traditionally is a narrative structure that functions to hold sexual desire at bay. In other words, the footnotes lose their hold as the characters become closer, sharing more personal facets of their lives, and eventually becoming sexual. In this way the footnotes subtend the narrative in such a way as to track sexual desire and the confusing and contradictory aspects (and theories) that attend to it. I think it is essential to read the footnotes along with the narrative since they add to Puig's experimental narrative style. If they are confusing, that is the point. Unexpected desire, like love, always is.</span>

                    <span>Some very thoughtfully written responses (Rebekah, reader from Seattle, Jenna, pjmittal, et al). And some good synopses as well (be careful though, Erika's, while well written, is a bit of a spoiler).<P>Since the above topics have been so adroitly covered, I won't dwell on them. But I couldn't resist seconding Stephanie Zuercher: one of the most interesting things about this novel is the choice Puig made to use dialog, almost exclusively, to tell the story. As you read consider this technique & the fact that you still get an excellent picture of the setting. Masterful prose styling. & very original. I can't think of another writer that's done the same (but I'd be interested to hear if anyone else can; please throw the author's names/titles my way, as would love to read them).<P>& for those that didn't understand the use of footnotes or didn't like them--it's merely a post modern flourish (perhaps an homage to T. S. Eliot's _The Waste Land_?). Ignore them till you reach the end then go back and read them. Or ignore them entirely. But read the book. It's an A+</span>
