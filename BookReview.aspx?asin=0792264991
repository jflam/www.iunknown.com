                    <span>Organization is well above average but it's not a textbook so the index is still not as strong as a textbook.<BR>But, it is a how-to book and chapters are to the point, clearly written. It's sitting with my other reference books, now that I've read it. Very handy ref. book.</span>

                    <span>This book describes what you need to know to make good pictures of people. The book begins by discussing composition and then turns to equipment and lighting. The book then focuses on various types of people photography: street photography; people in action; portraits; familar subjects (family members) and the photographic essay. The book includes a list of useful web sites and explains how three professional photograhers work. They are Cary Wolinsky, Sisse Brimberg and Lynn Johnson. I love these different viewpoints because they provide food for thought.<BR>The photographs leap off the page. They are stunning and make me want to get out and photograph. I highly recommend this book. It also is of a size that will easily fit in your camera bag.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book along with the companion book on Landscapes. A lot of the same material is covered, and in both cases I think does a pretty good job. The material is dealt with systematically, discussing both machinics, technique and composition. <P>Like other books that survey a broad subject, I think it tends to miss some specifics that would be necessary to really learn at a detail level. For example, the discussion of flash photography discusses built-in flashes, dedicated flashes, and studio lighting all in one short chapter, but in not enough detail to help you make much progress with any.<P>I did like the sections by other National Geo photographers who wrote a couple pages describing their thoughts and delivering advice.<P>So this is a pretty good book and is one of those things you should read even if you know most of what it has to say.</span>

                    <span>Hello All,<P>Ok, so I needed some help to shoot a few pics of family and friends so, I picked up a copy of this book. My first impression was that it seemed to have some good tips and techniques but, upon reading it thoroughly, I have to say folks, this one falls a bit short. I have made the move into the realm of digital media and as such, am hungry for help IN THOSE AREAS. This book just doesn't go there enough for me. Sure, you'll get plenty of tips pertaining to FILM media but, what I want is DIGITAL!<P>Would I buy this book again, probably not BUT, if I was still using film, then this book would fill the bill.<P>Ciao All!!</span>

                    <span>The People and Portraits Field Guide continues along one branch of the first NGS field guide. Somewhat more advanced composition and technical advice is provided, tailored to the specific art of capturing people in their environment. Caputo writes a book that is not only succinct, but also enjoyable to read. <P>Continuing with the format of the original are the profiles of National Geographic photographers, each with their own set of advice. This is a primary strength of this set of field guides and something that separates them from other books. The bios are interesting reading in themselves and give a brief glimpse into the work and vision of different artists.</span>
