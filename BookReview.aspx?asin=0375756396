                <span id="Label1">The ancient Romans were responsible for many remarkable achievements&#8212;Roman numerals, straight roads&#8212;but one of their lesser-known contributions was the creation of the tourist industry. The first people in history to enjoy safe and easy travel, Romans embarked on the original Grand Tour, journeying from the lost city of Troy to the Acropolis, from the Colossus at Rhodes to Egypt, for the obligatory Nile cruise to the very edge of the empire. And, as Tony Perrottet discovers, the popularity of this route has only increased with time.<br><br>Intrigued by the possibility of re-creating the tour, Perrottet, accompanied by his pregnant girlfriend, sets off to discover life as an ancient Roman. The result is this lively blend of fascinating historical anecdotes and hilarious personal encounters, interspersed with irreverent and often eerily prescient quotes from the ancients&#8212;a vivid portrait of the Roman Empire in all its complexity and wonder.</span>

                    <span>This has got to be the most original travel book I've ever read. I bought it because I've been to Italy and Egypt, and am planning a visit to Greece this summer, but I think anyone with a love of travel would enjoy it. It makes ancient history alive and accessible (I used to love 'I, Claudius') through human interest -- sightseeing, food, a fair bit of sex (who knew the Romans were THAT ribald?) I learned a huge amount about the Roman world without even realizing it -- the small details pile up until you feel like you've actually been to the Empire yourself! Anyway, I thought it was a hoot. The bit at the end about his visit to a Nubian wedding actually made me cry with laughter.</span>

                    <span>This is a truely a very enjoyable piece of history and travel writing showing that we are not that far from the ancient Romans who had their own travelling itches to scratch. It tells of a journey from Rome through Italy and onto Greece and Turkey and then to Egypt. Perrottet is an engaging writer and can mix history and anecdotes together beautifully. The complaints ofthe Romans should very similar to today's tourists. I enjoyed the stories of his long suffering girl friend and their often hilarious adventures. The chapter on Capri is a great tale.<P>Having just completed the Italian leg of the journey, Perrottet is often spot on in his descriptions of Naples and Capri. <P>I like the way Perrottet blended in the stories of the present with travel stories of the past. A very intelligent and funny book that is highly enjoyable on every level.<P>As an Australian reader, I liked the way he linked the site of Gallopoli to the main narrative and showed that for all our civilisation, we have moved only a short distance from the Romans.</span>

                    <span>If you have any interest in Classical history (especially the more human, socio-economic and religious aspects) and/or enjoy tongue-in-cheek travel writing by authors such as Bill Bryson (A Walk in the Woods) and Tony Horwitz (Confederates in the Attic), then pick up Tony Perrotet's illuminating and hillarious look at tourism, ancient and modern. At just under fifteen dollars, this book provides entertainment and erudition without the need for mortgaging the home on airfare, Mediterranean tourist trap hotels, Russian made rent-a-car deathtraps or dodging terrorists at the Valley of the Kings. Pagan Holiday is a a great summer escape!</span>

                    <span>In the year 5 BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus was presented with a small oval map of the known world. A larger version was hung in the public colonnade. There the public could see the known world as it stretched from Spain to Britain to India to Arabia to Northern Africa. For its time the map itself was a feat. A team of Roman scientists had poured over the charts of surveyors sent to every corner of the Empire. The map inspired the first tourist industry in the world. The Grand Tour of Antiquity started in Rome, of course, wound through the Greek Isles and Asia Minor, and then sailed up the Nile to Aswan. <P>Tony Perrottet calls this the "Route 66" of Antiquity and aptly calls the first edition of his book by that name. Inspired by the map, Perrottet decides to make the same trip. This book is a combination of what it was like to travel in Antiquity and what it is like to travel the same route today. Though separated in time by 2000 years, so much of travel is still the same. I cannot help but notice that Perrottet has written about the wilder, crazier, mis-adventurous side of traveling. His travels are like those currently portrayed on the Travel Channel. I cannot help but picture him with a sly grin on his face as he tells the stories of his travels. After this one should read Lionel Casson's _Travel in the Ancient World_ (which Perrottet depends upon quite a bit) just for comparison.</span>

                    <span>There were moments that I laughed out loud, and then there were moments that I felt the copy dragged a little bit. But overall, not a bad read. Les, his pregnant girlfriend is amazingly tolerant. Thought it was strange that she felt that she couldn't stick around for the English-speaking monk in Greece<BR>for fear that he might convert her, but then she volunteerily consumes a meal prepard by an obviously ill man in Turkey ("he wiped his nose on the back of his hand and continued to cook"). No big surprise that she turns up deathly ill the next day, but she wanted to maintain diplomacy. There were some great literary quotes in the book, references to Homer, and a lot of fun trivia.</span>
