                <span id="Label1"><P>PHP has rapidly established itself as an extremely popular open-source server-side scripting language for creating dynamic Web pages for e-Commerce and other Web applications.  It runs on any Web server, and it offers a simple, intuitive, and universal solution for easy-to-program dynamic Web pages.</P><P>The latest version of PHP is a major new release that includes a new scripting engine which greatly improves the object model, adds exception handling, and provides a much better infrastructure for the integration of external technologies like Java or .NET.</P><P>This version of PHP requires significant changes in the way most Web developers approach their programming tasks, and the <I>PHP Developer's Cookbook</I> shows how to accomplish these common PHP taskes using the new version.  The main content of the book is presented in a problem and solution format, logically organized on a topic-by-topic basis.  Each question specifies a goal, and the following text provides a detailed solution that achieves the stated goal along with any additional related information.</P></span>

                    <span>I am a newb when it comes to PHP, but not when it comes to programming in general. The Content is very cleanly laid out. It is straightforward, but by no means simple. For using some detailed code, I was surprised at the lack of commenting on the code. He steps into some areas not expected by me. For instance, he lays out some XML / XSL based code that I was itching to know and now I do! <P>However, he also covers some topics that are so basic that I felt it hurt the book overall... I learned most basic code from such books as Sams Teach Yourself PHP in 24 hours... so to cover the few basic topics like he did felt more appropriate for a beginners book... But he does make up for it with some VERY in-depth code. Just wish he commented his advanced code to help the newbs a little more... <P>If you're going to get a book to help you with specific issues? This is your book... (as long as your issues are his) If you want to learn PHP? Get Sams Teach Yourself PHP in 24 hours...<P>Either way, do yourself a favor and check out the Index here on Amazon... You might just find exactly what you are hoping to do, in which case, his coding is great...</span>

                    <span>Becoming more advanced in the field of PHP programming, I needed a solid reference to help me along the way. This book did just the trick.<P>It gives problems and solutions to everyday problems that programmers face, and conveniently groups the examples by category, such as strings, arrays, etc.<P>PHP Developer's Cookbook helped me with many of the tasks that I was currently embarking upon, and looking through its contents helped me find new and better solutions for current and future problems.<P>A word of warning, however, this book will probably NOT teach you PHP. The categories are not placed in a good order for beginners, but are great for those of intermediate and expert programmers alike. If you are new to PHP, I would say look elsewhere, say PHP Essentials, but I would recommend that you definetely keep this text in mind if you decide to further your PHP skills. Strongly recommended for intermediate and expert PHP programmers.</span>

This isn't "PHP Cooking for Dummies" ... and I, for one, am glad.</span>

I've found this information helpful in solving future problems, as I learned what was going on under the hood, therefore, I knew how to optimize the solution.<P>An excellent book, if you want solutions to problems that you'll constantly encounter, its meant to be a reference on the programmer's bookshelf, not a way to learn PHP (although it definitely has _improved_ my PHP knowledge), ....<P>...</span>
