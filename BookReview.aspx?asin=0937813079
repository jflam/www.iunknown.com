                    <span>I sm the author of the book and I wanted to alert readers that the second edition is not the most recent edition of the book. The second edition was published in 1997, not in 2002, as Amazon.com's listing states. The third and most recent edition was released in 2002. In between official editions, I also update the book. The latest printing--the 18th--will have 26 new pages, plus updated maps of Hollywood. It will be ready to ship in June 2004. <P>To order the most recent edition of the book, make sure you click "All Editions" and then click "Third Edition." Contrary to what you might read, Amazon.com has plenty of books in stock. <P>If you have any questions you can e-mail me at through the North Ridge Books web site.</span>

                    <span>There must be 50 Hollywood homes books on the market. If you visit Beverly Hills, a tour-bus or map salesman will gladly take your money. But W. Gordon's remarkably accurate and truthful guide will spell out where the buses point out homes where movie stars never lived. Gordon provides detailed directions and maps to the sites you want to see. And loads of "goodies" and information. He shows you how to get to Arnold's palatial block of homes in Brentwood, and warns that driving there is a $ 500 fine and possible jail time! Wow! He also gives directions to Rudolph Valentino's original 1920's mansion(and much, much more). Forget the B.S. Here it is. When I e-mailed him for an up-date, he gladly provided it for free(see the book). Why waste time driving around freeways?</span>

                    <span>This is a not so typical tour guide which provides its reader with a lot of bang for his/her buck. It provides information which is fairly accurate regarding the living (who tend to move quite a bit). The listings provided for death scenes are very accurate (assuming you only die once). Ditto for burial sites (assuming that remains stay put in one place.....unfortunately, that isn't always true as I seem to always be finding out). What is really impressive about the many editions of this book that have been published to date is that the author constantly updates the information in the book, so that it is as accurate as it can be given the odd and fluctuating state of celebrity mindsets (and fortunes). <BR>So if you are willing to assume that some of the information may become outdated, you will probably enjoy this book quite a bit.</span>

                    <span>I purchased the first edition in 1995(?) and have purchased revised copies since then (frankly, I don't remember the # of revisions). The information in the book is very accurate, but you have to keep in mind that celebrities move quite often. That's why you will periodically need an update (duh!). The book is laid out by communities/neighborhoods, and this feature is very helpful in preventing a lot of backtracking. It's a great book for a first time visitor to LA or a habitual return tourist such as myself, who is always looking for something fun and/or new. As the author warns.....remember to respect the privacy of these people. I'm sure they don't like having this information readily available to tourists.</span>
