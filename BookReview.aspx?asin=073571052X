                <span id="Label1">"C++ XML" is a book exclusively devoted to the power and complexities of integrating XML standards into C++. As a developer, this is a book you cannot miss. "C++ XML" addresses all major standards, toolkits, and types of applications dealing with XML as a format for representing and exchanging data, as well as XML behavior, from a C++ standpoint. It explains the implementation of applications and reusable frameworks for all major XML purposes exclusively using C/C++ parsers and toolkits, such as expat, Xerces, Xalan, libxml2, and Microsoft's MSXML.The high-end theory and examples in this book - such as development of OpenGL applications, Visual Studio Wizards to automate DOM procedures, GIMP extension to interpret XML scripts, and more - and its exclusive C++ orientation - separates this work from any other resource (online and offline). It is a must-have for any programmer interested in a specialized, complete, and detailed view of XML technologies.This book will show you how to master:-All major XML technologies addressed exclusively from the C++ perspective (C++ SAX, DOM, XSLT, Xpath, and more)-Every aspect of efficient server-side, standalone, and client-side C++ development for XML-Extensions to your C++ programs, allowing seamless XML and database integration-Advanced techniques for the development of Windows and graphic Linux XML applications-Important concepts using examples showing applications of C++ libraries and XML (MFC, OpenGL, ODBC, GTK, and more)The CD-ROM included with this book contains:Hundreds of MB of working code, showcasing C++ exclusive applications of all major XML standards and toolkits, including (but not limited to) MSXML, Xerces, Xalan, Xpath, XSLT, SAX 2.0, DOM Level 2, and SOAP. Every line of code in the book is supported by a working program.</span>

                    <span>This book is devoted to C++ developers with aim of integrating XML technologies. The author assumes basic knowledge of C++ and XML.<BR> <BR>The first chapter summarises the concepts used in XML and DTD. DTD limitations are addressed in chapter 15. XML fragment examples are used throughout the chapter.<P>The second chapter gives a brief over view of the XML family of technologies (including XLink, XPointer, XPath and XML transformation).<P>Chapters 3 - 8 discuss processing XML with C++. Topics include Event-driven processing (expat - non validating XML parser) and C++ wrappers and example code.<BR>Chapter 4 cover SAX and C++ with fully code example (XML trimmer). Chapter 5 goes further into detail about SAX C++ 2.0 and more advanced topics. Chapter 6 and 7 show the power of DOM. The chapters include an XML editor with full source code.<BR>Chapter 8 provides a detailed look into SAX and DOM from an Advanced C++ programmer perspective, covering design and memory allocation.<P>Chapter 9 introduces XML Schemas, TREX and other modeling languages. Chapter 10 looks at both XPath and XPointer with C++ source code examples. XSLT Transformations are described in chapter 11, with examples of using conditions, low and high level api. The chapter concludes with a sample application (vxslt). This chapter could have been much longer and more detailed, however the author gave a good overview of XSLT.<BR>MSXML, Xerces and Xalan are the main toolkits developers are using to implement common activities. Chapter 12 presents these toolkits with simple C++ examples.<P>Chapter 13 is interesting because it is about XML Messaging and creating XML-based extension languages for C++ programs. Chapter 14 focuses more on XML messaging with an overview of SOAP and XML-RPC. The final chapter covers XML's role in database representation, such as serialisation and communication of database data.<P>Some of the code examples are Microsoft Visual C++ specific but most code should also work with other C++ compilers on other plaforms. The author has done a good job in summarising the main topics of interest for C++ developers and does not venture into too much unnecessary detail. We would recommend this book to all C++ developers what really want to make use of XML in their applications. visualbuilder.com</span>

                    <span>Although XML is a buzzword du jour, its acceptance in the C++ world<BR>is surprisingly slow, especially in non-Microsoft environments. This<BR>is mostly due to the lack of an accepted and standardized API. The<BR>standardization process is painfully slow and even though there are<BR>a number of publicly available parsers with C++ bindings, they vary in<BR>their approach to XML processing as well as in the minute details that<BR>make them work with some C++ compilers but not with the others.<P>In such an environment, a book devoted specifically to processing XML<BR>using C++ is mostly welcome. Read below and decide for yourself.<P>The good: <P>- the book covers all major XML processing technologies<BR>available for C++ programmers. It provides examples and explains the<BR>difference in various approaches. <P>- It will not bore you with XML basic description, excessive quoting<BR> of XML standards, or useless hype (99.9% of XML books out there are<BR> plagued with all of the above).<P>The bad:<P>- Even though all of the technologies are compared, the comparison is<BR> crammed in the back of the book, after the chapters describing all<BR> of these technologies in great detail. This sounds like a poor<BR> choice, because these technologies are very different from each<BR> other and different tasks require different approaches. A good<BR> overview and comparison of all of those in the beginning would be<BR> much welcome. It would give readers an idea of what technology to<BR> choose.<P>- Most of the large examples are Windows-oriented.<P>- Source code for the examples is only available on an attached CD.<BR> It is not available on-line, which is a shame - I though we've<BR> already passed the stage of "proprietary examples." Apart from other<BR> obvious advantages, having examples on-line would facilitate<BR> contribution of patches and improvements from the readers.<P>- Speaking of the examples on the CD, they are presented in the worst<BR> manner I've ever seen. The examples I've played so far are bundled<BR> with XML parser distribution (each of them!), have plenty of<BR> temporary files around (like editor backups, or files that Visual<BR> C++ produces). Even those examples that are supposed to work in both<BR> UNIX and Windows come with no Makefiles, the source code looks and<BR> feels rather immature (I though, one learns to NOT supply an<BR> identifier to #endif directive during the 1st year of C/C++<BR> education). All in all, each example I've seen so far feels like a<BR> quick hack, hastily cooked up and released without a mere attempt to<BR> make it look presentable. This is really bad, since, given the<BR> scarcity of books on the subject, there will be plenty of people<BR> fighting with the source code from the book.<P>The bottom-line: this books falls way short of my "golden standard"<BR>(UNIX books by W. Richard Stevens). Nevertheless, it seems to be the<BR>only book on the subject and it does cover all major technologies. If<BR>you need to work with XML in C++ - buy this book. Once a revised<BR>edition is out (or a better book appears), switch to it.</span>

                    <span>Some people believe in pages, the more the better. I do not think so. With wealth of information on the Web, it is not hard to generate a thick book by cutting-and-pasting. But it requires hands-on experience, good judgement, thougthful evaluation, and careful selection to generate a book like this one. I like the concise and right-to-the point description, especially the UML diagrams, which make the points clearer.<P>Moreoever, thick books with too many details can get out-of-date quicker because it is the details that obsolete quickly.<P>Equipped with the basic concepts learned from this book, one can confidently surf the Web for more detailed and up-to-date informaion.<P>I think this book worth every panny I paid.</span>
