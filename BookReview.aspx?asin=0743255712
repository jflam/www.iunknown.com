                    <span>For the bulk of my voting life I was registered as "no official party." As I aged, I came to despise the Democrats as much as the Republicans as basically self-serving and spineless. I had voted republican when I first voted, then many years of voting anywhere from green to independent, basically voting for the best candidate that represented the US citizens and not their own special interests. <P>I was disappointed Al Gore decided not to run again, because I believed the Democratic party derailed his campaign and had he gone with his instincts he would have run a very different campaign in 2000. I was never a Clinton supporter, but he got my support because I respected Al Gore. I had never contributed to a political campaign, and never volunteered. The most I did was sign petitions, vote, and write letters.<P>Buying this book confirmed what I had been thinking for some time...that Howard Dean is a giant among men...the first politician to come around in my lifetime who has a backbone and stands up for what is right...regardless of consequences. The fact that the Democratic party fears him as much as the Republican party only makes me respect him more, because both parties need major revision and need to start representing the American people instead of their own special interests.<P>In this book you learn about a man who is quiet humble, hard working, honest, and insightful about his own strengths and weaknesses. He doesn't condescend or pander to his audience. It is a simple book about a strong, courageous and unassuming man. His dedication and respect for his wife is something not often seen in candidates of either party, and his ability to learn from mistakes and redirect without selling out is what is sorely lacking in our government. I believe Howard Dean understands community, and unlike the rest of the Dems or Repubs, wants the people to have a say in their own government and to unite rather than divide. While any candidate would be better than George Bush, the American people are sick of business as usual as far as politics is concerned. No other candidate will lend a voice to the people and be the leader who can change this country for the better. <P>We can be strong again instead of the cowards we have become under the Bush regime. If Howard Dean is not the 44th president, HE will be no worse off. He has already had several successful careers. We, the great people of this country, are the ones who will be negatively impacted, censored, threatened, living under a dictatorship this government has become. Regardless of who wins the election, Howard Dean has awakened the sleeping giant, we, the American people. <P>We will continue to grow our communities; we will no longer be silent, marginalized to the corporate interests and far right monopolized media. We will no longer tolerate Republicans who destroy our country and Democrats who do nothing for fear of risking their political careers. We will unite, we will fight, we will knock on the doors of every apathetic American and get them to take a stand in their own life and liberties. <P>This is just the beginning, Howard Dean's candidacy. I believe him when he says this is not just about electing a new president, it is about TAKING BACK AMERICA. Unlike all the other candidates, Howard Dean is beholden to only one special interest group...we, the American people. His accountability is to us. I am now a volunteer for Dean, a contributor, and an ardent supporter. As a patriot and positive reformer, I AM Howard Dean's special interest.</span>

                    <span>Howard Dean's Winning Back America was a pleasure to read, an optimistic balance between autobiography and political philosophy, from a passionate and intelligent medical doctor who served as a five term governor of Vermont, who is currently the frontrunner to be the Democrat nominee to challenge Republican George Bush in 2004. <P>The reader is immediately struck by the sense that this book is one of very few in the political world which is NOT ghost-written. The 15 chapters on topics ranging from Dean's personal background to geopolitical strategy are written in a highly conversational and inimitable style, as if Dean spent a few nights with a tape recorder for later transcription. <P>In the course of 179 pages, Dean traverses miles of relevant issues with characteristic insight and common sense. This reader's only disappointment was that the book lacks some of the depth Dean is capable of, if only due to the book's brevity. <P>The author's passion on civic life and good government is manifestly evident in his evocations of Theodore Roosevelt as his champion of an environmental vision that has withstood the test of time. Dean presents healthcare and balanced budgets with the vision of Kennedy - extolling the nation to do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. <P>The book's introduction is a call to civic action, to work together in common cause, to restore America's sense of community, after years of being divided by past and present administrations on matters of race, gender, sexual orientation, and income. <P>The reader learns about Dean's roots as the eldest of four boys in a well-established family with American roots which can be traced back to the 18th century, his youth in East Hampton, his decision to choose medical school over a life in the investment banking business (explaining the one part he did like about investment banking was the money management), his global travels, his days at Yale, and how he met his wife Judith Steinberg.<P>While establishing his medical practice in Burlington, VT, Dean became involved in local politics after successfully campaigning for a bike trail around Lake Champlain. He served as Lt. Governor while maintaining his medical practice, becoming Governor at age 43 in 1991 upon the death of Richard Snelling, whose example Dean admired as a "person of integrity who wanted to run the government properly without regard to party". Dean proceeded to win five two-year terms as Governor, and here tips his cap to 30-40% of the Vermont Republicans who supported him (in addition to his Democrat and independent support), primarily for his fiscal responsibility.<P>Dean makes reference to his legendary "cheapness" in an amusing anecdote about a suit he bought at JCPenney in 1987 for $125, a story of Dean's utility and frugality (he still wears the suit), reminiscent of the charm from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger at a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder's meeting.<P>The reader also learns about the death of his younger brother Charlie, how Dean overcame this loss, and how Charlie's death shaped Dean's outlook on life. <P>The second half of the book focuses on Dean's candidacy for President of the United States, our current situation and his ideas for the future. Dean points out that he knew George Bush as a straightforward man back when they were both Governors, and expresses his alarm at the radical departure from the relatively moderate governorship Bush provided in Texas (moderate by Texas standards anyway), and Bush's jerking the nation sharply to the right upon becoming president, contrary to Bush's past record and his campaign promises.<P>Here Dean spends several chapters focused on solving the issues of today's America - from job losses, budget deficits, the threat of terrorism, environmental degredation, and loss of community, to global epidemics and strife that threaten to engulf us all. <P>Dean makes his vision for America clearly stated in his views towards multilateralism and international cooperation, economic fairness, balanced budgets, and equal rights for all. Throughout, he emphasizes the values of truth, innovation and moral clarity in leadership. He makes a passionate and effective call for providing all of America's citizens with healthcare and secondary education, and how to make these things available and affordable for all, for the good of all.<P>He closes with the words of Marin Luther King who said "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter", and Dean repeats his constant admonition that "I am not going to tell any American that I can solve all their problems. That power is in your hands, not mine." <P>An excellent book which I can only hope to scratch the surface of in such a brief review, Howard Dean's Winning Back America is candid, timely, and highly recommended.</span>

Too bad regular americans didn't take the time to really listen to what he has to say. Get the book and learn something. It is worth it!</span>

                    <span>Dean makes a lot of good logical arguments on how to turn the country around. He is not the loose cannon that the conservative press makes him out to be. We need more free thinkers like Howard Dean. Sure, he is not perfect, but he adds a great deal to the national debate on important issues like health care, education and national security. <P>Jeffrey McAndrew<BR>author of "Our Brown-Eyed Boy"</span>

                    <span>This is an EXCELLENT book, I was actually quite surprised to discover. I didn't expect the Governor to come across well in written words ... I thought the book would be just a ghost-written, watered-down version of the campaign speeches ... sort of like a book you might expect from G.W.B. I should've known better. Instead, I found the book to be very inspiring; quite easy to read ... and in complete harmony with the truth I know. <P>You'll read it more than once.</span>
