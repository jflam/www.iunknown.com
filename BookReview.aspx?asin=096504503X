                    <span>This book might not be for every rider.  But the data on the different kinds of plans that one can make in relation to riding I think is excellent.  Also, when you see the comments by Wayne Rainey (a hero of mine for sure), then you know this information applies at the top level of riding.  <p>Also, the section on one's sense of speed--I've been doing some racing and around racetracks for years, and there isn't anyone else that even talks about this (not in a fashion I can understand that is).<p>The checklists that Code provides at the end of the chapters can really help pinpoint a riding problem.  That is valuable to me.<p>Again, not for everyone, but a little reading of this book, and a little patience with one's own riding can equal big gains.  Well worth it.</span>

                    <span>I have roadraced for about 5 years now and have used the checklists in this book MANY times to help answer questions that I didn't even know existed within myself.  <p>Having this book handy helps since I don't always have Keith there to ask me the proper questions.  There are certainly things that should be thought out after a ride or practice session and this book HAS THE QUESTIONS to think with!!!!!   I really recommend this book to anyone who wants to ride faster and/or better through those twisty corners.<p>GREAT BOOK!<p>Stoney Landers</span>

                    <span>Soft Science of Road Racing Motorcycles is quit a good book for tuning your race bike. But it's intended for recrational use. For real racer's it's to basic. While tuning my own bike it was usefull to use the books.  The comments are also very handy. It does explain tunning a lot of  different bikes so it can be very wide used. All in all it wasn't a bad  book at all espiaccialy if you are a 'recrational' racer!</span>
