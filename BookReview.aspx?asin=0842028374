                <span id="Label1">This book provides a first-hand, grassroots look at life in Cuba, including very vivid descriptions of its people and places. <i>Real Life in Castro's Cuba</i> illuminates the human face of Cuba, which over the years has largely been hidden in the shadow of Fidel Castro. <P> <i>Real Life in Castro's Cuba</i> is written by Catherine Moses, who lived and worked in Cuba as a press secretary and spokesperson for the United States from 1995 to 1996.  This compelling, compassionate portrait contains personal observations about the Cubans' struggles, triumphs, hopes, and daily compromises to survive.  The Cuban population lives with a deteriorating infrastructure, forcing many hardships on the people, including a scarcity of food, fuel, clothing, medicines, and other basic needs. <P> The author's detailed cultural account of Cuba introduces the reader to everyday Cubans: from party officials to dissidents to everyone in between.  It shows how Cuba's socialist system works and gives reasons why Fidel Castro is still in power.  <i>Real Life in Castro's Cuba</i> also describes the significant role of religion and spirituality in the life of Cubans.  Although Moses expresses regret over the state of U.S.-Cuban relations, the purpose of the book is not to choose up sides.  Instead, the book is designed simply to introduce readers to real life in Cuba. <P> The book's unique approach allows an intimate picture of life in a faded Marxist regime.  As the author writes, "Cuba is a curious mixture of Spanish Caribbean, socialist ideals gone awry, memories of what was, and a desperate need to survive."</span>

                    <span>Having read portions of this book while on a recent visit to Havana, I was a bit disappointed by the difference between Moses' words and my own daily experience. This may be a helpful book to read for anyone looking for a general sense of Cuban culture, but it can't be read as an accurate documentation of Cuban reality, and Moses' perspective and motivations must be kept in mind at all times. <P>For all of her denouncing of the Cuban "party line," Moses doesn't stray far from the U.S. government's policy, which is to be expected - she worked at the U.S. Interests Section during 1995 and 1996. One thing worth remembering of that period compared to the current day is that the Cuban economic situation has somewhat improved since Moses' experience - though the "Special Period" instituted at the fall of the U.S.S.R. has not officially ended, the worst has passed for the moment. Of course, there's no denying that Cuba is economically depressed, and extremely so - but Moses' portrayal of Cuban life is a bit exaggerated for Cuba in 2001. <P>Moses may favor ending the embargo, but only as a means of encouraging free exchange of U.S. anti-Castro publications and the market-dominating manufactured goods of consumerism. She consistently downplays the severe economic effects of the U.S. embargo (rightly called a "blockade" by Cubans - it's more international than bilateral), instead blaming the ever-popular failure of socialism. She should notice that this "failure" has produced systems of health care and education that the U.S. has yet failed to imitate. Never does she acknowledge that perhaps the U.S. could learn something from Cuba, only seeing the great wisdoms of capitalism that tourists and U.S. propaganda might distribute. <P>To be sure, Moses' perspective of Cuban life is not fully wrong, nor direct U.S. propaganda - but just because she has the freedom to separate her opinion from U.S. policy doesn't mean she does. She's right that the Castro regime is fundamentally flawed and denies many liberties, but she would do well to put these elements of Cuban life into perspective - instances of the U.S. government cracking down on dissent and violating human rights may be less publicized, but no less significant. <P>While Moses certainly learned a great deal in her time in Cuba and tells her experience honestly, she never fully escapes the paternalistic condescension so common to U.S. "Imperialists." Perhaps an accompanying "Real Life in Bush's United States" would put some perspective on this book, but failing that, a reader would do well to find a more genuinely Cuban perspective - my tourism guide was more balanced than this, and even Cuban government propaganda would make a decent counter-point to Moses' limited thinking. Do not expect an objective opinion from an agent of the "Empire," and you won't be disappointed.</span>

                    <span>All those whose interest in Cuba has been caught by the plight of little Elian Gonzales would do well to read Catherine Moses' evenhanded and compassionate take on Cuba. Ms. Moses, a diplomat assigned to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana for 20 months, writes with the painterly eye of a fiction writer yet also with the precision of a scholar, which she is. With no exploitative interests in Cuba, hers is a unique position from which to view this society. Her book is rich in details about the daily life and work of the people, the history of the revolution and the American relationship to Cuba in recent years. Those who need a refresher course on the Migration Accords or the Fifth Party Pelenum can learn the details here. What is most powerful about the book however, is not its delineation of politics and policy, but its deep appreciation of the spiritual vibrancy and love of life of the Cuban people. If you are interested in Cuba, I can't think of a better place to start.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Dry and poorly organized, this book is little more than a series of disjointed ramblings loosely divided into chapters. Ms. Moses apparently wrote down her remembrances as they randomly popped into her head, but she never went back and edited them to put them into any semblance of order. Back and forth she goes, in one sentence telling how the Cubans are oppressed, in the next telling how they are resourceful and able to make do with the very little they have, how they see no hope, then that they see the light at the end of the tunnel. What she relates is so generalized that one could easily substitute the name of any oppressed group of people for "Cuba" and be telling their story with equal (in)articulation.<P>Especially irritating is the fact that she mentions numerous individuals, and whether a revered patriot or her kindly next-door neighbor, she describes each in terms as mundane and pointless as skin tone and intelligence level, attributes some blasé word or phrase to him or her meant to be clever or all-knowing, then rarely mentions that person again. Worse, her final statement about that person is often something to the effect of, "I'm not sure whatever became of him."<P>Referring again to the book's generalities, most readers will already know that the Cubans are an oppressed people; that they live in a police state that (like every police state) follows their every move and metes out punishment to those who do not toe the line; that they (like all oppressed peoples) are conflicted by a love for their homeland and the idea of chucking it all for another place and a better existence. Again, in my estimation these are commonsensical, everyday notions. It is not necessary to have lived in Cuba to understand them. And although there has to be a wealth of knowledge available from someone who has lived there, it is to be found in some other book. This one does nothing to impart the Cubans' unique plight, and after reading it, the reader will know little more about Cuba than he or she probably already does.</span>

                    <span>Some of the other reviewers for this book have forgotten that no book exists independently of its author's experience. Unless one has preconceived notions about how life in Cuba "should be" rather than how it is, the mere fact that Ms. Moses lived in Cuba as a U.S. government employee is neither to her credit nor her discredit. Much more significant is the fact that Ms. Moses provides a perspective few Americans are able to have. It is ridiculously cynical (and even sensational) to suggest that Ms. Moses is simply spouting a "party line" - certainly she hoped for more cogent, astute readers. It is much more reasonable to assume that her book is a reflection of her honest experience, rather than an homage to her "bias." <P>It is worth noting that this book is a useful first glance, yet hardly sufficient pre-trip reading for anyone planning a trip to Cuba. As a university Spanish professor who leads student trips to Cuba on a fairly regular basis, I do recommend it to student participants as pre-trip reading, but balanced with some other types of analysis, such as Jane Franklin's "Cuba and the United States: A Chronological History," which is decidedly more "pro-Cuban" (sold freely in Cuba, incidentally). <P>Only by taking a balanced approach to Cuban issues can anyone hope to unravel the intricacies of Cuban society and U.S.-Cuban relations. Does any one book give a complete and accurate picture? Of course not. Does Moses' book capture the honest experience of an American living in Havana at an interesting time in history? Most definitely.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Reading the long-time review-of-the-day by Ms. Abbey, I find myself wondering if she read the same book I did. In each instance, her criticism is diametrically opposed to my perception of the book's intent and content. I did not see Ms. Moses showing "naïve judgment of the successes of the revolution." Rather, I read a deeply personal description of "los Cubanos." This is not a political work. Ms. Moses has chosen to not condemn governments, but to depict with crystal clarity the day-to-day struggles faced by those who would continue to live in Cuba.<P> I certainly did not find her comparisons between life in Cuba and in the USA chauvinistic. Furthermore, I consider Ms. Abbey's suggestion of comparing Cuba to other Caribbean or Latin American countries intellectual snobbery. If one is trying to bring home to a lay readership the realities of Cuban life, one doesn't compare it to an equally foreign standard. For example, if I want to convey to American readers how much an item costs a German, I convert the price to US currency, not that of neighboring EU-mate Austria. This is not an example of American economic egocentrism. It is merely ensuring that the reader understands the writer. Ms. Moses compares Cuba to America because that is the standard Americans know.<P> Regarding the embargo, again I do not believe Ms. Moses discounted its impact. She did not blame the deprivation of Cubans on the embargo, but neither did she blame it on Cuban governmental mismanagement. She described conditions with a minimum of editorializing, either pro- or anti-Castro. (While I can only speculate, rather than a defense of US policy, I read opposition to the embargo "between the lines" of her writing.)<P> I was not surprised by her reaction to the Cuban government's treatment of gifts of books and printed materials from the US Interests Section. Once I recognized the obvious affection Ms. Moses holds for Cubans (which Ms. Abbey acknowledges), I saw hurt in her reaction to their rejection. Whether Ms. Moses is old enough to remember Red Scare days is not important since her reaction is not revulsion to a political ideology. It is the hurt felt by a friend when a gift is rejected. Yes, that may be a trifle naïve given her official position, but it is nonetheless admirable. Would that all US diplomats felt so toward their assigned countries.<P> Ms. Abbey's review seems to come from a belief that a book on Cuba that fails to condemn US policy thereby defends it. Wrong! Ms. Moses' descriptions of the Cuban people transcend policy and politics. This is as it should be since the subjects of her description have no opportunity to affect either. They are "los olvidados" [the Forgotten Ones] and Ms. Moses has spoken eloquently on their behalf.<P> What is this book NOT? It is not a travelogue, although the beauty of the island is described in detail. It is not a political screed against the Castro regime or US policy, although their grass-roots effects are the basis of the book. It is not a detailed analysis of the history of US-Cuban relations, even though the lingering connection between our two countries is described with sensitivity, almost suggesting a feeling of love lost. Finally, to use Ms. Abbey's phrase, It is certainly not a "myopic view of 'the world according to Uncle Sam.'"<P> "Real Life in Castro's Cuba" is a well-written, deeply personal description of the Cuban people. I defy anyone to read Ms. Moses' account of meeting a Cuban army veteran wounded in the war in Angola and not be moved. The picture on the cover of the paperback edition captures the essence of the entire book. The children are next to a well-paved road, but three are sharing a horse with a blanket for a saddle and a rope for a bridle. The fourth girl is on a man's bike far too large for her, and they all lack shoes. Yet, they are smiling warmly. This book was definitely not written by a US State Department apologist, but by one who obviously has "el alma de una Cubana" [the soul of a Cuban].</span>
