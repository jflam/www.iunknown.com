                    <span>There is no framework, nor any theory; you may find many of the "tricks" are common-sense but which are we commonly overlook or neglect. A book that teaches you tactics that can be put into use right away. It is worth to read this book</span>

                    <span>While the market is flooded with books on how to pitch, sell, wrangle and close a deal, this book rises well above most of them. Author Roger Dawson takes salespeople step by step through the economic and psychological aspects of successful negotiating. Expertly and conversationally written, and strategically structured, this book actually delivers what its title promises: plenty of secrets about power negotiating. View your job in sales as a chess game you can control because you know the rules, from the opening gambit to the power plays in the middle, to the all-important close. If you've read Dawson's Secrets of Power Negotiating, you'll find a good bit of repetition here, but even when he cites the same gambits, he discusses using them to make sales. You only need to read one of the two books, but we [...] say make it this one if you're in sales. Learn these gambits, so you can say, "Checkmate."<br /></span>

                    <span>I have read a lot of material on selling and negotiating and wish I had  read this book by Roger Dawson a long time ago. Concise yet comprehensive  in terms of content, this book will undoubtedly throw light on how to  manage a successful sale through careful negotiation from the initial  contact to closure.</span>
