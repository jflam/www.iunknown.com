                    <span>I am fortunate to have an autographed copy from when Mr. Skoudis taught a SANS class I attended; and have had to take a lot of time getting it read in the meantime.  This is the book that I would recommend to anyone that would learn the workings of worm, virus, trojan horse and other malware - not how to write them, but how to understand and deal with them.  The information on setting up a lab to examine these critters is a good start for those wanting to understand attacks - but like other reviewers have said, this book is not for one without a grounding in computer security.</span>

                    <span>This book provides the best review of malicious software that is presently available.  If you need a comprehensive reference then this is the book for you.  The author is a well-known and respected security analyst and this book provides solid information at a level suitable for the system administrator. Unlike so many books of this type, it is not a camouflaged endorsement of some vendor's products or a simplistic and alarmist text.
<br />
<br />Topics covered include:
<br />- viruses, with a brief history and description of the various types and their mechanisms;
<br />- worms, again with a brief history and description of the various types and their mechanisms;
<br />- mobile code, including browser scripts, ActiveX controls, Java applets and mobile code as it occurs in email clients and distributed applications.  Given the increasing amount of mobile code, this is particularly valuable;
<br />- backdoors, particularly Netcat and VNC but covering some others as well;
<br />- trojans inlcuding wrappers, source poisoning and browser co-option;
<br />- rootkits for Unix andWindows;
<br />- kernel-mode rotkits for linux and Windows;
<br />- possible modes, including BIOS and microcode attacks.
<br />
<br />"Encyclopediac" is the only description I can give, but be warned that it's not for the general reader, or for newbies.</span>

                    <span>One of the most comprehensive books I've seen lately on malware is the title Malware: Fighting Malicious Code by Ed Skoudis with Lenny Zeltser (Prentice Hall).  
<br />
<br />Chapter list: Introduction; Viruses; Worms; Malicious Mobile Code; Backdoors; Trojan Horses; User-Mode Rootkits; Kernal-Mode Rootkits; Going Deeper; Scenarios; Malware Analysis; Conclusion; Index
<br />
<br />In each of these chapters, the authors give a brief history of that malware type, an in-depth explanation as to how they work, and complete coverage on how you can help prevent getting damaged by it.  Each chapter wraps up with a conclusion, a summary, and the list of references for the chapter.  For readers looking to find detailed information, they won't be disappointed.  For readers looking at receiving their first exposure to the material, the writing style is easy to follow and doesn't overwhelm.
<br />
<br />I personally enjoyed the chapters on Malware Analysis and Scenarios.  The Analysis chapter gives you an excellent outline for setting up a malware analysis lab.  You'll learn how to set up the hardware, protect yourself against leakage to other networks, and what software is needed to do your analysis.  Following this outline, you'll be well-prepared to track down bugs like a pro.  The Scenario chapter is also excellent.  The authors set up three malware scenarios with actual people and configurations, and show how certain choices and mistakes can lead to disaster.  There's lots of good learning material here.
<br />
<br />Great book, excellent material, and a definite must for your security bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>I reviewed Ed's "Counter Hack" in Nov 2001, giving it five stars as the perfect introduction for newcomers to the security field.  2 1/2 years later I'm happy to say "Malware" delivers the same quality, clarity, and insight that made "Counter Hack" a winner.  My only regret is not having read and reviewed "Malware" sooner!<p>One of the impressive aspects of this book is the degree to which it is "future-proofed."  Ed looks at current threats like worms, viruses, trojans, and user- and kernel-mode rootkits, like any author might.  He then takes malicious software to the next level, from the kernel to BIOS and finally to CPU microcode.  These BIOS- and microcode-level attacks are still largely theoretical (aside from BIOS-destroying code), at least as far as the public knows.  When the world sees these threats emerge, "Malware" will be waiting to explain their capabilities.<p>Ed writes exceptionally well, bringing coverage of Linux and Windows kernel internals to the masses.  I enjoyed learning about the trojaned Tcpdump distribution, anti-forensics, DLL injection, and API hooking.  Lenny Zeltser's chapters on malware analysis were helpful as well, and I recommend attending his reverse engineering classes.  The book also shines with respect to skillful use of tables and diagrams to explain key points.  <p>The only technical inaccuracy I found was the proposition that UNIX filesystems maintain a c_time as "creation time" (p. 319 and elsewhere).  c_time is "change of inode time," like changing permissions on a file.  Windows' NTFS "c_time" is indeed "creation time," however.  I also found myself skipping many of the author's analogies, like the king, knights, castle, etc. story in the BIOS/microcode discussion.  Ed's writing is clear enough that anyone with some technical experience should be able to understand his points without falling back on analogies.<p>I highly recommend "Malware" to anyone who wants to understand the capabilities of our digital enemies.  Many other security books are vulnerability-focused, spending time explaining ways to subvert, breach, or abuse poorly designed or deployed applications.  "Malware" is threat-oriented, showing the capabilities of intruders and their code.  This knowledge will change the way you think about security and the trustworthiness of your systems -- especially those exposed to the harsh reality of the Internet.</span>

                    <span>Working with a computer that doesn't want to behave on its own is frustrating enough. Between buggy code and the blue screen of death, many of us have wanted to throw our computers against the wall. Unfortunately, not only do we need to deal with these wonderful, little problems, but we also need to deal with programs that are intentionally trying to inflict problems on or through our computers.<p>These programs, collectively called "malware", include many different categories; however, we know them best as the "virus", "Trojan horse", "rootkits", "backdoors", and a lot of others. These malware tools (based on "mal", the Latin word for "bad" or "evil") are the bane not only of system administrators but also of the average home user who just doesn't know any better.<p>"Malware: Fighting Malicious Code" by Ed Skoudis is meant to educate the reader not only of the dangers of malware but also of ways to combat malware.<p>"To defeat your enemy, you first must know him." - Sun Tzu<p>This phrase is the core philosophy of this book. This 647-page fighter's manual is the computer-age version of Tzu's "The Art of War", except in this case the war is between you and the low-life morons who create the programs that facilitated the need for Skoudis to write this book.<p>I found this book to be far more fascinating than I thought it would be. After all, how exciting can a book about virii and Trojan horses really be? "Malware" is written with a surprising amount of detailed, historical facts, real-world examples, and light-hearted humor that help to keep your attention. The author also takes extra steps to differentiate between the various types of malware. After all, how many people do you know who continually (and incorrectly) use "virus", "Trojan horse", and "worm" interchangeably? How many of you are guilty of it yourselves?<p>"Malware" covers a lot more than you would probably expect such a book to cover. Not only does it cover the more commonly-know malware, such as virii, Trojn horses, and worms, but it also covers topics like ActiveX Controls, Java applets, JavaScript, backdoors, and many others. It also contains a great deal of information on root kits, both user and kernel modes.<p>Sections of the book even go deeper into the possibilities of malware attacks against the system BIOS and microcode.<p>Those who expect this book to deal primarily with Windows will likely be surprised in the amount of detail that is given to UNIX (primarily Solaris) and Linux as well as Windows. In fact, each of these have their own chapters with respect to rootkits and kernel attacks. These chapters can be very dry, but there is a great deal of information in these chapters that any serious system administrator who is interested in security (as we all should be) should read.<p>The author goes into respectable detail regarding how the various types of malware attack and propagate, not only from a basic functional point of view but also from a detailed step-by-step method to explain exactly what each type of malware does at any given step.<p>An entire chapter is dedicated to analyzing malware. He gives solid theories on how to best set up an environment that will help you to detect, analyze, and build up a defense again malware before you introduce it into your organization. As many system administrators have found out at one time or another, sometimes spending time to find a prevention is much better than wasting time to fix a problem that is allowed to propagate. More often than not, playing "clean up" takes far, far more time than the time it takes to prevent an outbreak in the first place.<p>With the exception of the excessive dryness of and technical knowledge needed for the various rootkit chapters, I actually ate this book up. The majority of the book is not a difficult read, and I found it fascinating to read how these programs have evolved. In fact, malware has been around a lot longer than most people suspect.<p>The only problem that I had with the book is that the author was very clearly trying to not anger anyone, which I think forced him to not be straightforward on some issues. In particular, he has a whole chapter about ActiveX malware, yet he very blatantly neglects to mention the easiest and most obvious method of avoiding ActiveX problems - STOP USING INTERNET EXPLORER AND OUTLOOK! These are the only two major tools that use ActiveX since ActiveX is a Microsoft-proprietary component. So, to defend yourself against Internet Explorer and Outlook malware, such as plug-ins that take control of IE, STOP USING THEM! Mozilla, Netscape, and Eudora are free and work beautifully! There is no shame, anger, or bias in telling the truth that the best way to avoid ActiveX problems is to use tools that do not use ActiveX. I'm sure that he knows very well that this is the truth, considering the huge amount of detail that the book entails; but I am very certain that he neglected to say it because he (or the publisher) was skittish about upsetting the All-Powerful, All-Mighty Bill, which is completely unfair to the reader. Yes, I'll admit that I'm being anally retentive on that, but there is nothing wrong with saying, "Hey, folks! There are more secure alternatives out there that (gasp!) have nothing to do with Microsoft!"<p>Regardless, this book is a must-read for any security administrator who thinks he's knowledgeable about these matters. If you're a security administrator who thinks that you know just about all there is to malware or that a firewall and a virus scanner are all that you need, I can just about guarantee that this book will have your intelligence ego eating humble pie. The fact is that the enemy is far more complicated and intelligent than most network administrators will admit, and this book definitely helps you to know your enemy.<p>And just consider that the enemy will only get more intelligent and devious in the future.</span>
