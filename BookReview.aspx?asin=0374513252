                    <span>I bought THOUGHTS IN SOLITUDE because over the years I have become impressed with Thomas Merton's writings and because of a prayer that appears in Chapter II of Part Two of this book; the prayer was given to me several years ago and has become one I have prayed often. Merton makes it clear at the beginning that THOUGHTS IN SOLITUDE is not a book that everyone will enjoy or even learn from. The book is simply a collection of some of Merton's writings and prayers about living the life he was called to live; a life lived in solitude. The writings that make up this book are quite short. However, they are not light reading. In order to get the gist of what Merton was writing about and to allow the text to really soak into my conscious, I found myself having to re-read sections many times. I found the first section of the book to be more applicable to my life than much of what was written about in the second section, but there are some very useful bits there, too (the prayer I mentioned, for instance). I took a lot away from this book and it helped me revaluate the importance that solitude has in my spiritual life.</span>

                    <span>The title of this book derives from 1953/54 when Merton was able to enjoy special opportunities for solitude and meditation; the contents of this book are thoughts on the contemplative life and fundamental intuitions that seemed, at that time, to have importance. As such, the chapters do not necessarily relate to one another and are, as the title suggests, a collection of thoughts while in solitude.  "It is quite likely that intuitions which seem to be most vital to the writer will not have much importance for others, who do not have the same kind of vocation." For the writer, these reflections on man's solitude before God and man's dialogue with God in silence are essential to his monastic way of life. It is a counterbalance to totalitarianism and the murderous din of materialism that must not be allowed to silence the voices of the Christian Saints, Oriental sages like Lao-Tse or the Zen Masters or Thoreau, Martin Buber or Max Picard. "What is said here about solitude is not just a recipe for hermits. It has a bearing on the whole future of man and of his world and especially, of course, on the future of his religion." Part I is composed of 19 thoughts on aspects of the spiritual life; part II of 18 thoughts on the love of solitude<p>The desert, supremely valuable to God because it has no value to men, is the logical dwelling place for the solitary with nothing between himself and his Creator. But as man has moved into the desert for testing nuclear weapons or building casinos, the desert moves elsewhere. The new desert is despair.<p>All temperaments can serve as material for ruin or for salvation; if we make our temperament serve us we can do better than another who serves his temperament. The things we love tell what we are. A man who sins but does not love his sin is not a sinner in the full sense of the word. Even if we are temperamentally inclined to anger, we are still free not to be angry. We are free to desire either good or evil. Too many ascetics fail to become saints because their rules and ascetic practices have merely deadened humanity instead of setting it free to develop richly, in all its capacities. <p>Jesus had a clear vision of God but experienced our human emotions of affection, pity, sorrow, happiness, pleasure, grief, indignation, wonder, weariness, anxiety, fear, consolation and peace. If we are without human feelings we cannot love God as we are meant to love Him - as men. <p>Our five senses are chilled by inordinate pleasure. Penance cleans the senses and gives them back their vitality. Lack of self-denial and self discipline is the cause of mediocrity of much devotional art, much pious writing, many sentimental prayers and many religious lives. "Some men turn away from all this cheap emotion with a kind of heroic despair, and seek God in a desert where the emotions can find nothing to sustain them. But this too can be an error. For if our emotions really die in the desert, our humanity dies with them. We must return from the desert like Jesus or St. John with our capacity for feeling expanded and deepened, strengthened against appeals of falsity, warned against temptation, great, noble, pure."<p>No amount of technological progress will cure the hatred that eats away the vitals of materialistic society like a spiritual cancer. The only cure is spiritual.<p> A purely mental life may be destructive if it leads us to substitute thoughts for life, ideas for action. Our destiny is to live out what we think. It is only by making our knowledge part of ourselves, through action, that we enter into reality.<p>Real self-conquest is the conquest of ourselves by the Holy Spirit. Self-conquest is really self-surrender. <p>Laziness and cowardice are two of the greatest enemies of the spiritual life and they are most dangerous when masked as discretion. The problem is that discretion is one of the most important virtues.<p>"Why should I want to be rich, when you were poor? Why should I desire to be famous and powerful in the eyes of men, when the sons of those who exalted the false prophets and stoned the True rejected You and nailed You to the Cross? Why should I cherish in my heart a hope that devours me - the hope for perfect happiness in this life - when such hope, doomed to frustration, is nothing but despair?" <p>Thomas Merton has great wisdom to pass on to us if we are ready to receive it.</span>

                    <span>I was surprised and delighted to find this is a book that is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.  As such it is an ideal size to carry in the pocket, to read at any opportunity, to reflect, to consider,... and may I add a warning to the thoughtful, because of its insights, a danger to read in a public place.  Profound in its simplicity, pointed, honest, concise, an excellent learning tool as we walk the Way of Christ.  Highly recommended.  This book will stay with me for life.</span>

                    <span>Merton lays this book out into two distinct sections. The first is a discussion of the Christian life, and the second is the application to the life of solitude. Connection to God is probably the largest running theme through out and what Merton does beautifully is encourages a life with God that is not exclusive, but makes the most of moments where it is just a person and God.<p>What this book did for me is redefine lonliness vs solitude, as well as encourage me to look for positive opportunities to retreat to God for peace.</span>

                    <span>To defend the spirit against what Merton calls "the murderous din of our materialism", we must learn to live in solitude.  But true solitary life is not a withdrawal from society: on the contrary, it is the only way to become social in the fullest sense, because through solitude we come to comprehend God's profound love for us, so that we can love other men in imitation and reverence of Him.  Of the many themes Merton emphasizes in explaining true solitude, gratitude and humility are perhaps the most important.  To live in solitude is to be without attachment to material things, personal relationships, or even spiritual accomplishment.  Therefore solitude is a life of utter poverty and humility: our entire lives are a gift to God.  Through this act we discover that nothing is due us, and our lives become an ongoing prayer of gratitude for whatever gifts we receive.  For the true solitary, actions are far more important than thoughts, because, as Merton points out, if our ideas are not reflected in our actions, we do not really think them.  If we do not follow our true vocation our lives will be choked by internal conflict between what we are called to do and what we actually do.  Or worse, we may avoid the problem by ignoring our spiritual condition.  Merton's commentary is highly relevant to all who care about their spiritual condition, and all who seek God in the murderous din.</span>
