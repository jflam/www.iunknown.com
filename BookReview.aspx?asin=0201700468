                    <span>Some might question whether they need a separate book on stored procedure coding. Trust me, you do. <P>The book goes through one aspect after another of how to develop stored procedures for SQL Server. It differs from other books in that it treats T-SQL like a real language. It posits that you need to apply design patterns to you work, that you need to test it, and that it needs the same type of source code management as any other language. <P>This book is different from other T-SQL and stored procedure books for this very reason. It approaches the language from the perspective of a professional developer. As Ron Soukup says in the forward this is a masterful guide written by a master coder. <P>You can learn from this the same way I did. The writing is detailed, flows well, and extremely technical. Add to this the great SQL-XML info and HTML chapter and you have a book no SQL Server developer should be without.</span>

                    <span>This book is simply fantastic. The writing is tight, but engaging -- lean, but mean. From the first page to the last, Henderson doesn't waste a word, yet I found myself not able to put the book down. That's really rare for a technical book. Henderson has a direct, friendly style that is, unfortunately, rare in computer books. He's a writer's writer -- I think he would be successful in any genre. I can definitely see why the book is selling so well (it was the #1 bestselling "SQL Server" book here on Amazon when I searched a few minutes ago).<P>My favorite parts are:<P>* The database design chapter. This was a hidden gem that I didn't expect to find in a programming book. It encapsulates all one needs to know to design robust databases on SQL Server.<P>* The version control (Visual SourceSafe) integration chapter. Goes along nicely with the theme of treating T-SQL like a real language.<P>* The Design Patterns chapter. As far as I know, this is the first published discussion of formal Design Patterns for the T-SQL language. Again, it goes nicely with Henderson's point that T-SQL is a real programming language.<P>* The UDF chapter. Many of these are so unique and such high quality that I'd bet they have commercial value apart from the book. Take the Median() function, for example. Henderson shows how to write your own aggregate functions and provides Median() as a very useful example.<P>* The SQLXML section. This set of chapters is by far the best expository reference on the SQLXML technologies I've seen. From the introduction to XML itself to advanced features such as SQLXMLBulkLoad, I found this section extremely compelling and useful.<P>* The .NET introduction. If you didn't have a good reason to dive into this technology, you certainly will after you read this.<P>* The Xprocs chapter. I always wondered how to write these. Now I know. The chapter takes you from ground zero through building several very useful xprocs of your own. Xp_setpriority is a real gem.<P>* The programming philosophy essay chapters. These give weight to the book and finish off the book's overriding theme -- that T-SQL is a real language that you must approach professionally just like any other language if you want to be truly skilled in it -- very nicely. This is the first "cerebral" treatment of software engineering I've seen in a SQL Server book.<P>By my count, Henderson converses in at least 7 difference programming languages in this book (VB Script, C/C++, T-SQL, C#, VB.NET, XML, and Delphi) which, frankly, is amazing. That anyone could know this many languages at this level is simply mind-blowing. It certainly reinforces his status as a guru. If you want to learn from the master himself, get this book and study from cover to cover.</span>

                    <span>The XML coverage in this book is not useful for anyone interested in doing full blown XML development. XPATH routines and the amount of time spent on transforming and xquery are not sufficient to get beyond a beginner's stage. There are many beginners writing simple tabular represenations of a table in xml, you may be able to pull that off with this material. But any true development with browser based user input and interactive sqlxml programming simply does not exist in this book. I wish my job only required me to know what is in this book!!! I run a large healthcare IT and we are far far beyond this outdated material. In fact this book is behind the w3c standards and will not even work as shown for what little there is here. My 15 world class programmers have told me this is the last book and series they would turn to for anything. There is no reference material for any arguments or things you don't want to have to open yet another browser session for, when my guys are running 10 to 15 screens doing development. Any good book will spend the pages this one does on the "essays" of no value listing the indispensible tables of values any programmer needs at his fingertips. <BR>Very weak on XML and SQL in general.</span>

                    <span>What is really great about this book is how it tackles SQLXML wholistically--it does not assume that you already know XML and starts from ground-zero. So there is a chapter on just XML itself--nothing Sql-specific. After that it gets into each of the SQLXML pieces one-by-one--you learn them by example and by writing XML docs and code--the very best way. The book also covers many other Sql bases such as writing stored procs and all that involves--so you get the full picture. I highly recommend you read this book if--like me--you create software for Sql 2000 for a living.</span>

                    <span>It's funny that no one thought of this before but the book has a message that is unique and new...writing code for Sql Server has to be approached like writing code for any other platform: as an engineering discipline. I had never heard this preached until I red this book, but am now a firm beleiver in it.<P>I have Henderson's other book and this one is a nice follow-up. there is naturaly some overlap between this book and the TSql book but not much. this one gets into coding conventions and version control, extended procs, design patterns and of course SqlXml...things the first book doesn't talk about. I look at this book as the big brother to the first one. It's more serious and more for the professional developer as opposed to being more of a dictionary of solutions to difficult TSql problems.<P>I also really liked the undocumented TSql chapter. This was my favorite chapter in Henderson's last book and this version of it has some new tricks and secrets. Just knowing about these will make you a better DBA because you will have a better understanding of what is happening under the hood.</span>
