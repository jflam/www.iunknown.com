                    <span>I really liked this book. Ita has lots of cool trick and hacks that I hadn't really heard of. Writing was good, but the best part was learning some cool new ways to use my favorite toy. If you want to get them most out of your ipod this is the best book out there.</span>

                    <span>Although this book was written in 2003 and is more targeted to the beginner, it does offer some things of value:<P>- a review of third-party products available<BR>- tips on ensuring good music quality<BR>- other tips and tricks you're unlikely to find in Apple's documentation<P>After spending several hundred dollars on your iPod, I think it's reasonable to spend 3% or 4% of the purchase price to ensure that you're using it optimally.<P>I don't regret buying this book.</span>

                    <span>Another editorial decision to make a book longer than the subject needs so the book can cost more. Extra 160 pages is uninformed and unqualified speculation about telecommunications and copyright laws, and feeble attempts at humor. Why do people who aren't funny in real life think they are funny in print?<P>Every second or third sentence refers to "your ipod", as in "your ipod" this, and "your ipod" that, and "your ipod" the other thing. Annoying and weird. Could of used some editing and recasting of sentences.</span>

                    <span>I'm sure the book was very useful when it was current (May 2003) but it is really out of date for things released after that date. The iPod User's Guide that comes with the unit gave me all the information I needed. This book gave me a headache.</span>

                    <span>I am using my ipod (15gb) with MusicMatch (PC) and I could't be happier with this book. Notwithstanding the previous reviewer's comments, this book made me a speed user in one reading. MusicMatch is the software provided by Apple for using an ipod with a PC. The software is not intuitive and before reading this book, this book, I was ready to take my ipod back to Apple. Happily, that wasn't necessary. Once you break the code, MusicMatch is easy to use and reliable. While this book was written for an earlier version of ipod, the chapters on MusicMatch are up to date with the latest version of the software as far as I can tell. Even the chapters that pertain to the ipod hardware are reasonably applicable to the new hardware. Go ahead and buy this book, you'll love it. BTW, I am not in anyway connected with this book or its authors, publsihers, etc. I am just a very satisfied user.</span>
