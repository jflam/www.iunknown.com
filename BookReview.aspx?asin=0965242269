                    <span>Vocabulary Cartoons II contains 290 key words presented through cartoons.  
<br />
<br />Each word contains a "link" word which is intended to serve as a mnemonic device, helping you to associate the new word to the word that you may be more familiar with.  A good deal of the "link" words rhyme with the "key" word.  To make the association even easier, the authors have provided a phrase which is easy to remember as in "We LAMENT that Joe got buried in CEMENT".  This phrase is portrayed through a cartoon, providing a visual mnemonic.
<br />
<br />Under each cartoon, you'll find three sentences with contexts where it may be appropriate to use the "key" word. These examples will also help you to develop the feel for the word, as well as to create more associations to the key word.  
<br />
<br />The authors have appropriately said that this book is "for everyone".  The words in this vocabulary book seem to be for the most part on a high-school level.  The words in Vocabulary Cartoons II are no harder than those in the Vocabulary Cartoons - you just get to learn more words.

                    <span>This book is awesome for those who need to crack up their vocab for the SATs as it is a key to getting a high score. This book is very simply and easy to use and for every ten words you get a couple of excercises to go through what you have learnt (just to make sure you did learn em). I went through this book really quickly (around 6 days) as it everything there was clear and easy to remember so you can zoom through the book with no problem and remember most of the words very quickly without re-reading them to yourself because as soon as you see the word the picture which it gives ya pops into ur head and the meaning should be there.</span>

                    <span>It's funny. I got a 770/800 on my verbal SAT. My friends can't believe I did it by studying a book comprised of funny little cartoons and rhymes. It sounds funny, but it works!<p>Studying from a gigantic book of thousands of vocab words are boring and scary. This book however, actually makes it fun! I didn't think useless vocab which is tested on the SAT could be fun to learn, but I was wrong.<p>Great book. If you are studying for the SAT verbal...Buy it!</span>
