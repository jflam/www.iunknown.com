                    <span>I applied David Bach's suggestions on dealing with consumer debt and managed to reduce my credit card interests in half AND get rebated $300 in charges as a result of some negotiating. Then I tackled pairing down my money spending through coupons, loyalty deals, and a whole host of other living expense reduction tips. It's incredible what Bach has learned and is sharing. This is a nuts and bolts pure action plan. Highly helpful and a great reinforcing of positive wealth habits. 
<br />
<br />If you are considering going to the Millionnaire Mind Intensive with Harv Eker - do not bother! Just read David Bach's tips for either Canadian or US residents and save your time and avoid Eker's gimmicks.</span>

                    <span>David Bach has once again created a powerful book to give all of us late starters hope with a plan that works. Updated for 2005 with all of the new financial changes that have occurred over the years, fans of those 1,000 page out of date books written by non-financial people who merely write for a living will find themselves lost in th is great volume where real meaty and accurate advice exists.
<br />
<br />You will find some of the same information as in Bach's best selling "The Autmatic Millionaire" and much new information as well. Bach really drives home,  almost to death, the importance of starting your own business...the right way. And how you can start for as little as $100.
<br />
<br />Bach also beats to death the significance of getting into real estate investing...again the right way. Perhaps Bach hit a nerve with fans of the "nothing down" schemes and perhaps that explains the "one star reviews" and bashing of this book.
<br />
<br />This book is loaded with information you won't find anywhere else. You certaintly won't find it in JBQ's outdated tome or in the get rich quick, "nothing down" schemes and scams that are out there.
<br />
<br />Overall a great book and deserving of at least 5 stars. Also recommend "The Millionaire Next Door" and "The Finish Rich Millionaire Workbook."</span>

                    <span>There is no magic bullit or mystical secret to achieving wealth in our society today. It has never been easier than it is today nor has there ever been more mis-information to make it seem harder than it really is.  There is a proven step-by-step approach and David Bach has absolutely nailed it.  Don't fall for get rich quick or other gimmicks by self-proclaimed gurus.
<br />
<br />David's book was a great affirmation for me to know I am on the right track.  I will recommend this book to several of my friends and loved ones who feel overwhelmed and stressed by where they are in relation to where they want to be.  Thank you David!   </span>

                    <span>The trouble with most people nowadays is they are looking for a SEXY way of getting rich! They want it fast and big! Well, the road to riches requires discipline and work for most people. That is the boring truth. If nothing else, the numbers that David Bach offers as proof that this system works is worth reading the book. Heck, even if you have to go to the library and check it out...do it! Read it! Start early! Time is the most important tool in the whole plan. If you save/invest now, WHILE you are paying off your debts, you will be so far ahead. 
<br />
<br />Trust me! The price of this book was worth it to me! I saw Bach on Oprah and was amazed at the trouble some of those folks were in. Trouble is, most Americans are in such debt that they have given up! Did I call my creditors and get my interest rates lowered ten years ago? YES!! They will work with you as long as you talk to them in nice, polite tones. It took a while to get out of debt but I did it. 
<br />
<br />Now I am HOT to invest!!! I told my husband this book is better than porno! He laughed! He has been applying these principles for years and his investment in savings thirty years ago multiplied 8...yes 8 times! He invested in boring things, good solid companies, real estate, just like David Bach writes. But I needed to see it on the written page to "get it". At age 50, I am new to this game and am doing this with my own money. I am starting late but I know I will have millions for retirement of my own money. 
<br />
<br />Check the book out from the library for a trial run, or go to the big book store with the comfy chairs and read for a while.....you'll probably end up owning this book before it is all said and done! It was a marvelous investment in my life. I have been telling every woman, young and older about it!

                    <span>This is my third David Bach book and I've enjoyed this one just as much as the first.  Contained inside of this book is the solid common sense advice that others have written about and unfortunately many of us have not followed.  The whole point of the book is to encourage people to know that it is never to late to correctly manage your finances so that you have a retirement that does include financial worries.  For those who need more direction they should always consult a certified financial planner for hands on advice and guidance.  All in all, another helpful book by David Bach.</span>
