                    <span>I have purchased quite a few meditation CD's in last year or so, and this is by far one of the best!  
<br />
<br />Wayne Dyer's voice is extremely peaceful - which is quite important when attempting to meditate (I have found that the author's voices on several other meditation CD's actually agitate me so that I absolutely cannot relax!).
<br />
<br />Through this CD, I have reached that point where I am so relaxed that I actually start "falling into myself" - it's a hard feeling to describe, but it feels absolutely wonderful!
<br />
<br />The only downfall to practicing this type of meditation is that it's hard to do when anyone is within ear-shot - as you have to make sounds that can be heard by others.  But, this is the ONLY downfall!!!
<br />
<br />Overall, I would recommend this CD & book set to anyone interested in meditation.  If you are just starting to learn to meditate, and will need to do it with other people in the house, you may want to start off with something different (like the Celestine Meditation CD) - but I would get this CD anyway so that you'll have it when you're ready. </span>

                    <span>I looked forward to learning more about Japa meditation as I practice several different types and had heard Dyer mention it in another book. What I wasn't prepared for at all was the heavy God the Father, Christianized focus of the CD. I don't see myself as a child of some male parent in the sky. The word "father" is not one of comfort for me and does not speak of co-creation, it speaks of the dominiation and exclusion I felt in my experiences with Patriarical religion. Dyer would have been better off not giving an omnipotent being a sex or suggesting a traditional "human" role for him. </span>

                    <span>You would think that someone like Wayne Dyer, who has made millions upon millions of dollars off of primarily women, would find a way to refer to deity that does not aggrandize his own sex (male), but no. A short disclaimer along the lines of "You can think of God any way you want, but in this book I'm referring to Him as a MALE" is a slap in the face to his female listeners. I've listened to Wayne Dyer for decades. I was able to understand when all of his earlier works were self-aggrandizing; after all, he was insecure, but he still said helpful things. But I cannot understand his insistence on referring to God as a male, or even in an anthropomorphic sense at all. Surely he is creative enough to come up with something more accurate. I'll never buy his work again. Wayne, your audience is outgrowing you. </span>

                    <span>In his book "The Power of Intention" Dr. Wayne Dyer talks about a regular practice of meditation as essential to purifying your connection with the Source and manifesting all of your desires.  Through meditation, you can establish a direct link with the field of energy that makes all things possible.  It also allows you to connect with and get into harmony with your authentic inner self.  In "Getting in the Gap" Wayne Dyer outlines a simple-to-follow, yet effective, technique for practicing meditation.
<br />
<br />Many of us have heard about meditation, and perhaps even tried a few different techniques.  One of the most challenging things about meditation is achieving a complete focus in the absence of thoughts.  And yet, only when your mind is completely calm and quiet can you begin to get in touch with the Divine Spirit.  The meditation practice outlined in this book, called Japa, allows you to get to that gap between your thoughts in minutes.  With regular practice, using the Japa technique, you can learn to stay in the gap for extended periods of time.  
<br />
<br />This book is very slim, with just enough information provided for you to be able to begin the meditation practice.  There are six chapters:
<br />1.	Why Meditate?
<br />2.	The Gap and Why
<br />3.	Getting in the Gap
<br />4.	Staying in the Gap with Japa
<br />5.	FAQs Regarding the Gap and Japa Meditation
<br />6.	Testimonials about Japa Meditation
<br />
<br />What I found to be the most valuable part of the book is the audio CD that it comes with.  On this CD, it is essentially Wayne Dyer guiding you through the entire meditation step-by-step - and anyone who has listened to him before knows that he has a very powerful and soothing voice that greatly helps in the meditation experience.  In the appendix, the book also includes the complete transcript of the CD, so that you can follow along or refer to it later when you don't have access to the CD.
<br />
<br />In summary, this is an excellent book for anyone who wanted to start meditating or who tried other methods and found them too difficult.  It is a wonderful complement to the Power of Intention program, in which meditation is an important component.  It is also great on its own, as a self-contained meditation guide.    </span>

                    <span>Dr. Wayne Dyer cites that we have some 60,000 disjointed thoughts passing through our brains each day, so it's no wonder there's little time left to squeeze in another frantic thought... let alone a peaceful one.  What this book does is to provide a step-by-step method to idle our racing thoughts, slow down our minds and experience a level of peace and well-being that few ever enjoy.  What's really cool is that this book comes with a CD in the back jacket, so you can hear Dr. Dyer verbally "walk" you through the exercise as well as reading it.  I put the CD in my computer and loaded it on my iPod so I could listen to it at night.  I'm sure there are many valid and effective ways to meditate, and this is only one of them, but as a beginner this gave me a framework to work with.  I have read, on numerous occastions, the value of meditating, but none was as specific as this little book.  Just the realization that we are not our collective jumble of thoughts, helps me to see the world differently.  If you get turned off by the mention of God or Source or references to various religious scriptures, you may not like this book.  It assumes you are open to a spiritual viewpoint and does little to defend it, but instead explains and expounds on the benefits of making this connection. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend this book to those wanting to slow down, feel more peace/connectedness and make meditation a part of their daily lives.    </span>
