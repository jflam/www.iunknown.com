                <span id="Label1"><p>If the SATs measured what Boomers really learned during high school, you'd find "A wop bop a loo bop, a lop bam boom" on the Foreign Language test, the Chemistry exam would be about love songs, and the Grammar quiz would include "Ain't No Woman Like The One I Got." These and many more tests-with-a-twist await readers of The Oldies Music Aptitude Test: Trivia Fun for Armchair Deejays. Not your run-of-the-mill Q&A trivia book, the 600 questions are grouped by irreverent musical categories such as nonsense lyrics, musical maladies, and repetitive titles, all capped off with a hilarious final score interpretation. A nostalgic delight, The Oldies Music Aptitude Test is the entertaining and informative book Boomers will embrace for reminiscing about the glory days of Rock 'n Roll.</p></span>

                    <span>There had to be something to all the praise over at Oldiesmusic.com about this book. So I bought it and now I understand. This is one truly different and fun trivia book. You know all those "multiple-guess" (yawn!) trivia books? Thankfully, this isn't like those at all! This one has funny categories and it's actually humorous! There are clever cartoons too that oldies lovers will really appreciate. Just take a look at the cover art, hahaha!<P>Spread the word, this is a super fun book and why it's not available in "real" bookstores is beyond comprehension. My college reunion is coming up and I'll bring this along with my lava lamp and Desiderata poster to set the mood. ;-><P>Best $... I ever spent on a trivia book, I must say!<P>Hohoho</span>

                    <span>I consider myself to be a bit of a trivia buff, from history to TV to music. At least I did before I got this book. Barb Jastrab has assembled a set of "tests" within the book to help you determine whether you are a "player" or a "pretender" in the world of trivia. Once you begin, you can't stop! It's funny, it's enlightening, it's humbling, and it's full of "DUH I should have known that" moments. Challenging and fun, well balanced.<P>I do have one complaint, Ms. Jastrab. You are responsible for eight hangovers this past weekend. <P>Your book and an eggtimer became the fodder for a drinking game of sorts after an otherwise civilized dinner party. Yes, I know better, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. Anyway, at my age, I suffer a bit more than I did in my youth after such foolishness. <P>We have all agreed that next time we do this, we'll play for orange juice. But play again we must! Thanks for a great book and a fun challenge.</span>
