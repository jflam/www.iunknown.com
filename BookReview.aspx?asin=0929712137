                    <span>Before you buy this book, let me warn you that most of it concerns the derivations and formulae for the game of Blackjack. Amongst MANY other critical and informative Tables, Data, formulae, system comparisons and more,  you will be able to "derive" basic strategy for virtually any playing decision, using any number of decks.  For instance, are you unhappy with playing 16 vs Dealer Ten by regular basic strategy? Well, you can calculate when to "hit" or "stand" for any multiple card combination. Remember, you may have to read sections more than once, and you need to be at home with calculations and formulae. I love it. In addition, you are given, and shown, how to calculate the betting and playing efficiencies of all of the various Card Counting Systems, as well as that for Insurance.  If you don't enjoy seeing how the mathematics of Blackjack play out, this book has the BEST and MOST Complete Basic Strategy advice for virtually any number of decks. Although it is not a book dedicated to learning how to count cards, the wealth of information and the ability to learn how to calculate necessary information, will guide to to making a decision on which system to use, and whether or not to use ANY system. This is, for the Math oriented, the Best and Most Complete book, that gives me the freedom to calculate all those items with which NO ONE else could help me. I am a level 3 card counter, and I use Griffin's Basic strategy with multiple card options that I calculated from this book for my playing strategy. </span>

                    <span>Although this is a great book you really need to know what it is and what it IS NOT!
<br />It is not an introduction to blackjack. It's assumed you already know how to play the game.
<br />It is not an introduction to card counting. The author assumes you already know a card counting system, or at least have a basic understanding of what one entails.
<br />It is PROBABLY not going to make you a better player. It's not really a "how to" guide for the game as much as it's a guide to show you how to effectively ANALYZE the game.
<br />
<br />As the title suggests this book is a fairly comprehensive review of the theory of blackjack. While a traditional counting book will tell you the HOW of card counting, this book will show you WHY it works, how card counting systems are derived, how to compare the power of different card counting systems (the so-called "efficiences") and contrast them to an (linearly) ideal system. You will also learn how to calculate exact probabilities (well, really how to write a program to do this) that could be used to determine the values (in terms of expected return) of different hands or to design a tool that will give you the optimal play in any situation that may arrise in blackjack. This tool isn't to be confused with "basic strategy", which only gives you the optimal play off the top of a freshly shuffled shoe.
<br />
<br />This book is ideal for someone who is comfortable with playing blackjack in a casino environment, has a basic understanding of the difficulties faced by card counters, and is comfortable with mathematical formulas and their derivations (although a lot of concepts can be understood without a strong background in math, you'll get a lot more out of the book if you can follow its derivations). After reading it you should be in a position where you COULD develop your own card counting system, calculate expected values (essentially probabilities) for given hands and given plays, and have the satisfaction of knowing that you have a better understanding of the inner workings of blackjack than 99% of the people who play the game!</span>

                    <span>Peter Griffin's "The Theory of Blackjack" is an absolute classic.  No gambling library is complete without it.  The longevity of this title is testament to its importance.  It has passed the test of time.  It stands like a monument.
<br />
<br />Although it is an advanced read for most players, understanding the principles it presents is essential to being a successful Blackjack player.  Those who can't comprehend it simply shouldn't play for money.  I suspect that is why it is one of the few books recommended by Dr. Ford in his book: "How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken".  
<br />
<br />This book teaches you how to become a winner.  It was one of the first gambling books to honestly and accurately explain how to win at blackjack.  While its coverage is not comprehensive, it presents all the essential information and takes some interesting side trips.  Those few readers and authors who criticize various portions of it are not to be taken seriously.  Either they misunderstand it or they are trying to pump up their own importance by kicking at a giant.
<br />
<br />Griffin's relaxed and easy style of writing, for such a technical book, is extremely refreshing, sometimes funny, always informative and simply endearing.  If you haven't read this book, you are not fully informed about Blackjack - you have missed a major milestone in the history of the game.

                    <span>I ran across this book many years ago in a used bookstore (mine was the 2nd edition). I must say this book changed my opinion of books about gambling books. Up to that point, all the gambling books I've come across were laughable. But this book was startlingly different. It thoroughly explains the mathematics behind basic strategy and card counting techniques in a way that really made sense.<p>This may sound too advanced for many folks, but frankly the math is fairly easy to understand (it mostly uses basic statistics that you probably learned and forgot in high school). <p>If you are serious about card counting, the information in this book will help you evaluate BJ counting systems (or even systems you invent). It will also help you subtly modify your play for changes in rules at different casinos. <p>Do you need to be a computer programmer to use this book? No, but it wouldn't hurt. Is this book useful for writing BJ simulators? Yes, but it's also great for really understanding what it takes to be a really good card counter.<p>Personally, this book convinced me that I don't have the patience (or time) to become a good card counter. But at least now I know why.</span>
