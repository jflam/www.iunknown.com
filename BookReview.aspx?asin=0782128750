                    <span>This book is a good start for those who do not know anything about ASP.NET or are moving to web development. If you have some experience in web development you may find yourself skipping some chapters.<p>However, it is evident that the technical editing was not done properly. Chapter 18 had VB.NET code with an extension of .cs, which means it should have been a C# code.<p>I have not read Mastering ASP.NET using VB.NET (by the same author and publisher), but I suspect that most of the material in the C# version was just ported from VB.NET version.<p>I would not agree on some of the statements made about which authentication method but it does cover what's available and the book does explain some of the basics.</span>

                    <span>More lost then when I started reading. The code examples do not work without some tweaking. The assumed familiarity with the .NET framework is frustrating. This was very disappointing. I really needed to gain some quick knowledge, and it is not going to happen here!!</span>

                    <span>This is a beginner's book, not a reference. It is elaborate so it must be read with a good amount of concentration. If you don't read between the lines, you might miss some good points.</span>

                    <span>I have been an adult computer trainer for six years and was sadly disappointed in this book.  I found it to cover too much information incompletely.  I found no concrete application or practice exercises.  Usually, a book like this would start by presenting the concept, move to simple and conceptual examples to demonstrate the how, and then advance to more complex and practical examples.  Some areas of the book never move past the conceptual to the practical so I can't imagine a reader would know how to apply the knowledge.  Some areas covered basic examples but didn't go deep enough.  The authors need to take a few education classes before writing anything else that is so out there.</span>
