                <span id="Label1">When Adolf Hitler rose to power, he was the most adored man in Germany. He could have had the pick of any number of brilliant women...and yet he chose a simple girl from Munich to be his mistress. Eva Braun was only seventeen when she first met Hitler and her relationship with him remained a secret until after their death together.  <P>Adolf & Eva uses Eva Braun&#146;s own home movie footage and interviews with the people who knew them as a couple to explain the attraction they had for one another and to reveal for the first time the full extent of their intimacy. B&W / Color &#149; 50 Minutes</span>

                    <span>It's both bizarre and a little bit scary to see such a sympathetic prortrait of Hitler these days. Watching it does help you to understand what Hannah Arendt meant went she spoke of "the banality of evil", but it also makes you wonder how the producers could make a film that portrayed Hitler with none of the context of the world he tried to create. Scary.</span>

                    <span>I admit I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this DVD, but I was pleasantly surprised. If you've seen the color home movies of Eva Braun, then much of the material here will not be new to you. But the quality of Eva's movies varies, and this program uses high-quality, non-grainy footage, which added to its appeal. There are also some interviews with Hitler intimates through the years. They say nothing new, but their inclusion strengthens the overall effect. There are some questionable recreations here using actors, and they mis-identify Gretl Braun (Eva's sister) as Eva several times. I would have liked to have seen modern footage of the various Munich haunts of Hitler and Eva. But for the price, this is quite a good look at the relationship between the Fuehrer and his mistress.</span>

                    <span>To paraphrase Bill Murray in Caddyshack, this dvd really helps you get inside Hitler's pelt and crawl around for a while. Compared to more standars bios and, say, Triumph of the Will, this disc shows Hitler in a very human (if not likable) scale. First person accounts from those who knew Hitler on a non-political basis make him seem real and tangible. The human/ romantic angle here makes the story seem more timeless than the power plays of the time. The bunker stories are particularly interesting, as told from eyewitness accounts. If you want to see Hitler at his most real (and you may not want to:-), this may be the best disc.</span>

                    <span>Granted, much of the video is taken from "Eva Braun's Home Movies," but nonetheless this production is of awesome quality, and the price cannot be beat for a documentary on an aspect of Hitler's life. The interviews with Hitler and Braun staff members are more than worth the price alone. Also great are the recreations of events in the relationship of Hitler and Braun.</span>
