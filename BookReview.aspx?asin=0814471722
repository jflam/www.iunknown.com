                    <span>Thanx to the author, I passed with more than 81% in my first attempt!<P>The concepts in this book are neither complete nor concrete about project mgmt. It just looked like, the author is trying to fill the gaps in PMBoK, where ever more detail is needed. One ultimate prep info is the bulk of questions, nowhere else you can find! Even about the questions, take them only for your practice and try to understand the concepts from these questions. Questions in the actual test are much more plain and straight forward than presented here.<P>My last word is, first read PMBoK, then this book and try to consolidate the knowledge. FYI, I've never got a chance to look at Rita's book.</span>

                    <span>This book is a mediocre source for preparing for the PMP. It contains too many errors, inaccurate information and it is loaded with irrelevant information for the pmp test. if you do not want to pass the pmp test then read this book.</span>

                    <span>Other reviewers have noted various errors in the book. I'll add my two cents worth on this topic as well: on page #99 and #100 of the book Mr. Newell attempts to explain Stern Stewart & Company's EVA (Economic Value Added) equation. I have no idea where he came up with his definition and calculation, but it is absolutely wrong. First, EVA does not use the dividend rate to compute the cost of equity (in fact, I don't know of anyone who uses the "dividend discount" model to compute equity costs). Secondly, he completely ignores the after-tax rate of debt to calculate the cost of capital. I can go on-and-on about the oversights and weaknesses of his EVA discussion; however, in combination with the other errors and ommissions mentioned by a number of other reviewers, I'd say there is more than enough reason to take a "pass" on this book. Overall grade: D/D-</span>
