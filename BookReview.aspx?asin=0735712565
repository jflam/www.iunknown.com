So this is a test. If what I read in the book holds true this may help up my ranking...ironic.</span>

                    <span>This book teaches some web site design, some usability, and some basic SEO. Author thinks that SEO is not about getting top rankings. So, how can you expect her to teach you SEO? Do not waste your time and money if you know some basic SEO which you can find free on the internet. </span>

                    <span>Only half of the book talks about how to work with search engines. The rest of the book is filled with quick and dirty type of discussions about web usability -- you can get a better usability book than this. 
<br />  
<br />  If you are a technical person, forget about buying this book; you can find better information off the Web (or better still, you already know what she has to say!) If you are a non-technical person, I'd recommend you to do some research on the Web and spend your hard earned money somewhere else.
<br />  
<br />  The book is now pilled up with my old magazines in my bathroom for occasional quick reading.</span>

                    <span>The field of Internet marketing is really coming into its own. <p>There is a science behind designing websites that achieve top rankings in the search engines. <p>I've found one book that is easy to read, easy to implement, and extremely well researched. <p>Search Engine Visibility by Shari Thurow is the benchmark by which all other guides are measured. <p>If you have a website and expect anyone to find it, you should get this book. <p>I highly recommend it to all of my subscribers and Yellow Pages advertising clients.  It helps the people you're trying to find get to your web site.<p>The author and I have both been speakers at Search Engine Strategies conferences, and she consistently draws the largest crowds.  She puts the highest levels of search engine marketing ethics into everything she does.</span>

                    <span>After having read the book "Search Engine Optimization" back in 2002, I hadn't run into anything as useful and concise to help with the SEO (Search Engine Optimization, in case you're wondering) functions. The beauty of the book by this long time consolidated Web Marketer is that it is general while still being extremely useful. True, it doesn't focus on Google, but I think that is precisely its biggest strength, because there's life beyond Google.<p>As much as we'd like to think that Google is the ultimate Search Engine for which you need to optimize, the truth is that there are several others, any of which, if you do your homework, following the advice from this book, you will get the traffic you deserve... specially, considering the shakedown that the Search Engine industry will be submitted to during 2004 and 2005, as Yahoo! dumps Google and Microsoft strikes back with a propietary search solution.<p>All in all, I appreciated the information by Ms. Thurow and the structure it was given. It is one of the two best books out there on the topic.</span>
