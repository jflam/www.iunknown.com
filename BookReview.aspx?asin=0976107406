                    <span>If you wish real hard, do you change reality or does Bill Nye the Science guy fall deep into frothing convulsions? Does Einstein yank out his hair from the great beyond? Does Bush give science grants to Pat Robertson's Miracale Network? 
<br />
<br />A cult is a cult is a cult, whether from the right or left. The movie BLEEP is a frightful mess of propaganda as it is--is the book necessary? Perhaps it's a coloring book, or as an insightful reviewer guessed, a pop up book. 
<br />
<br />Why bother with messy facts or "experts" when feel good mantras make for great soundbites. Hiding behind scientific catchphrases is still useful of course!! If you're depressed, hey just toss your medication-it's all in your head! For that matter, if you're diabetic, you are choosing to be insulin dependent. Keep an open mind, man, after all, the squirrels still need a place to nest. </span>

                    <span>***Explanation 4 Scientific Minded** This book is NOT presented in a scholarly fashion for the Scientific Community but that's not who or what it's meant for. This book is presented in a manner closer to how the Fahrenheit 9/11 tie-in presented politics instead of a book by Richard Faynman, While all of it's parts are scientifically true a purest or fundamentalist may question the way the collected material is presented, but while the presentation may be debatable it is presented that why to move society forward. The ideas in this book are there to help, heal, inspire, change, and create interested on a larger scale where there is none. This read is a spiritual book based on science not simply a science book, if that's what you want there are plenty of those out there but most people don't and that's who this is for. This book is trying to express a perspective of the world that is modern to help society understand and change so humanity can move forward and away from archaic old world beliefs that are holding humanity back by tying us to ideas that don't work in the light of scientific discoveries. 
<br />
<br />Scientists tend break things done into smaller parts and that is the way they like it but this book is a Philosophy for life based on Science that collects Scientific ideas into a unified whole and perhaps it doesn't make sense as a world view to them because either they have found a way to unify old world religious ideas with scientific evidence or they have excepted science as absolute fact despite the realization by many that perceptions do influence findings with one example being that depending on what instruments are chosen when viewing light it either appears as a Wave or a particle, it's almost as if the light waits until we look at it before it decides how it's going to be perceived. 
<br />
<br />**Spiritual Revolution*** This book is the REAL LIFE truth encoded in The Matrix movies. If the vilest villain read this he would start to reevaluate his life and if we read it then we'll be able to understand and maybe forgive him. The World can be better then it is. Is this book and movie the changing mind shift novelty Terence McKenna predicted? This book is much more then a launching point it is a psychedelic mind melting catapult in consciousness changing. Change you're perceptions, Change who you are! This book is Enjoyable to read and will affect who you are for the better. If you want to Understand or just be Entertained you will be pleasantly surprised on both fronts. Can you have everything you want from life, if you believe you can it will begin The Process that makes it happen! This book is a tie-in for the most important Film to date and you and everyone you know and everyone should see it and read this just to SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT! And afterwards what next, while this book is a lot and very satisfying if you want more, I **RECOMMEND** you read**** ROBERT ANTON WILSON's**** books or listen to his audio book ROBERT ANTON WILSON EXPLAINS EVERYTHING (or old Bob exposes his ignorance) or watch the film about him and his ideas called Maybe Logic. But see this movie and read this book, it's a stepping-stone in the right direction!!!
<br />
<br />**ALSO EVERYONE** I recommend checking out and listening to www.airamericaradio.com to stay informed about what's going on and have a few laughs also animated political cartoonist www.markfiore.com

<br />I guess encouraging people who were blown away by this movie to read may not be an entirely bad idea.  The only problem is it merely encapsulates the same cherry-picked notions of Quantum Theory as an attempt to legitimize certain dogmatic doctrine in the New Age movement, specifically Ramtha.  Otherwise, a rather transparent attempt to further profit from a badly wrought movie, through the bank accounts of people eager to gain insights into our beautiful world, perhaps ignorant that they are being taken for a ride.</span>

<br />
<br />  Should have been a pop-up book so as not to confuse people with all those words strung together.  Thinking for ourselves is dangerous, let's all hide under Ramtha's skirt and see if she says it's all right to come out.

                    <span>Great accompaniment to the movie that blows your mind. Not only are there great pics in the book, there are great quotes from the movie. This is the movie that keeps you thinking and pondering even after the lights go up. I've seen it three times and plan to buy the DVD when it comes out next year. This movie has helped me re-evaluate how I look at life! Awesome!</span>
