                    <span>There is something about the British and their outlook towards American politics which is quite enjoyable.  They bring a refreshing civility and admiration for political thought and history that is more often than not absent in today's North American biographers.  In this biography of Lincoln Charnwood delves deep into the political atmosphere in which Lincoln rose to power and saw America through one of its most trying hours.  The author delivers a deep sense of what a thoughtful and kind man that Lincoln was.  It is an an unflinching look at Lincoln's spiritual side in which in comparison to today's commander-in-chief is quite startling for their similarities and differences.  
<br />His dissection of the politics of the era is simply fascinating.  This is a book for anyone who has a keen apreciation of politics and history.  Charnwood's unflinching directness in his portrayal of Lincoln leaves the reader with the sense that not only does the author have the deepest respect for Lincoln but that that Lincoln deserved every bit of it.   My copy of this book is a beat up 1950's paperback I found in a thrift store to accompany me on a trip to Louisiana and I would recommend to anyone who can get their hands on one.</span>

                    <span>Though it is dated in some of its facts and assessments,Lord Charnwoods classic study of Lincoln remains one of the dozen or so greatest books ever  written about our greatest President.What sets it apart from most other  studies of the sixteenth President is the attention it  gives the  intellectual and spiritual underpinnings of Lincoln's life and actions. It  is, in short a work of philosophical history, not a dry recitation of  facts. Charnwood is interested in the moral meaning of democracy and the  scope and limits of democratic leadership. He performs his task   beautifully. I , for one , found his old-fashioned Victorian prose a joy to  read, and a relief from the cliche' ridden jargon that too often passes for  literate prose today. A great book by a foriegn observer of America, fully  worthy of being placed beside Tocqueville and Bryce.</span>

                    <span>This was an excellent historical record of probably the greatest American that ever lived.  However, it has long, complex, diffcult to read wording that makes it somewhat labor-intensive reading.  The content is great, but  there are far easier to read (and understand) books about Lincoln.</span>
