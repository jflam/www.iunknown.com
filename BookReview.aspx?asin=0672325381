                    <span>The book does a decent job of covering visual C# material. But the way it is organized is so bad for new programmers that I can only give it one star. You keep getting "write this code, I will explain later" that most newcomers to programming will give up withing the first three chapters as all they do is point and click and write tons of code they have no ideah how it works. This book was obviously written by a programmer who doesn't teach new students. We have this book at work and none of the 4 people who used it had any success in learning to program in C#. 
<br />
<br />This is odd for a SAMS book, as they are usually excellent learning books. I would recommend the Teach Yourself C# in 21 days as a better tool for a new programmer to grasp the language.
<br />
<br />Even for experienced programmers (and I have been one for 18 years), the book is hard to follow. Phrases like "now add this code ..." whithout saying where (you are stuck looking at pictures in the book and your source code file to finally figure out where the code is suppose to go) doesn't help one bit.
<br />
<br />This is a teach yourself book, it should take you from scratch and teach you. All it does in the first few chapters is confuse you and discourage your from learning. I suspect this book was bought my many who ended up leaving it on their bookshelf thinking they cannot learn to program while the problem is not them at all. That is unfortunate! </span>

                    <span>I just finished reading this book cover to cover and I'm afraid I don't know C# much better than I did before I started.  I am now an expert in using the (really cool and powerful) Visual Studio.Net Integrated Development Environment, but I hardly learned a thing about programming.  So, if you want to be able to create cool applications by dragging and dropping and using menus, this book is great.  If you want to have a clue about the code behind your applications and/or learn some lessons in Object-Oriented Programming, you'll need another book.  (...)</span>

                    <span>Well i dont like to write to much. So i will resume myself to the essencial. If you want to learn the langauge in its core, the way it works, classes, objects, the difficult stuff, like many woust to say...then i dont recomend this book in any way.<br>Lets say that this books doesnt teach c#, it teach to do some programming with c#. It doesnt go further than the repetition statements, variables declarations, and the only database exemple you get uses databiding, in others words, wizards.</span>

                    <span>The first chapter was excellent in this book.  I am currently on chapter 7, but the gui details still go on and on....I really expected to see some more coding behind the controls in this book.  The nice thing is that this book is that it discusses retrieving some data from a database.</span>
