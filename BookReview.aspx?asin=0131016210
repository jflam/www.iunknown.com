                    <span>Book Review:<BR>Java How to Program, 4th ed. <BR>Advanced JavaÂ™ 2 Platform How to Program <BR>Deitel & Deitel<P>I finished three java programming courses at Santa<BR>Monica College two of which required the Java How to<BR>Program, 4th ed., the other was a java w/data<BR>structures course and I used the Java How to Program,<BR>4th ed. and the instructors lecture notes. I bought<BR>the advanced book to learn more about java and the<BR>net, java 2d, 3d and j2me since I am into pc and<BR>online video games development, and data base<BR>connections with jdbc since I know sql. Design<BR>patterns and enterprise java case study give<BR>industrial strength business applications.<P>The authors packed and packed java into these books.<BR>The books are easy to follow, and everything works. I<BR>found the exercises challenging but not overwelming. I<BR>have not ran across an exercise I cannot do, although<BR>some require in depth study of the topics covered. And<BR>when if all comes together it's fun. The chapters<P>build on each other very well, and the materials moves<BR>fast and stays interesting.<P>The cd's have everything I need to get started: what<BR>to install, how to install it, how to set the<BR>environment. The forte community edition is packed<BR>with java building and debugging tools that make java<BR>programming faster and easier to follow. Try the<BR>Reformat Code tool, and check out the text coloring.<P>I cannot say enough about these authors and their<BR>materials. Anybody getting into java programming will<BR>be more than satisfied for a long time.<P>Thank you Deitel & Associates</span>

                    <span>The first 3-4 chapters of this bbok are like a standard military uniform issue, and can be found in almost all of Deitel's books on the programming languages. That can be good anc comforting if you are already familiar with their style or if you are new ot programming. It can be painfully mind numbing for anyone with over 1 year's programming experience. <P>The structure of this book is no different from other Deitel books. So if you looking to tread unfamiliar terrain in familiar clothes, this is the book for you. If you want to get better value go look some place else. (I am looking too). Since this is the recommded text for the course, I am stuck with it for now. But personally, this is not gonna be my desk reference copy. Having said that.... the book does provide lots and lots of worked out examples (with logic and typo errors). color scheme printing eases the understanding process, and if you are a beginner in the java arena, stick with this book for now, until you are ready to fly away. and then you dont ever need to look back upon it.</span>

                    <span>This book has hundreds of example programs that compile and run, unlike many books that have code snippets, errors, etc. The exercises are great. Writing code is the best way to learn and going through the exercises will bring you up to speed.</span>

                    <span>The teaching method is moderately ok, but have the programmers ever worked in the industry? If they have it seems like they could come up with better examples. There is also no real sense of flow from one chapter to the next, everything is just a jumble of ideas thrown on paper.</span>
