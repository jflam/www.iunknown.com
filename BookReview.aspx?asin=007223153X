Includes short, real-world projects that teach just enough information that you&#8217;ll be able to learn it and absorb it. Plus, provides details for those converting their layouts from Quark or PageMaker2, and includes a color insert with examples of good layout choices, InDesign&#8217;s Swatches palette, and more.</span>

                    <span>This title is one of the better "How to Do Everything..." titles. Most of the others that I've seen aren't much better than the software manual, except for being in color; that is, they just tell you obvious things, like listing all the tools. This book has shown me some things I didn't already know about InDesign (I've been using it for a while, but never had any real training), particularly things that will make me more efficient. Books on InDesign aren't readily available, compared to Illustrator and Photoshop; any book that isn't awful stands out immediately. I don't think this one is as bad as the other reviewers make it out to be. (By comparison, the "Real World" book on InDesign was loaded with mistakes -- even naming the wrong program in some places -- even in its 2nd edition!)<P>P.S. Most times, when authors/publishers review their own books, they get no stars, which (unfortunately) Amazon averages in with the other reviews, dragging down perfectly good books. It might be useful for Amazon to fix this so that authors/publishers can self-review without hurting their scores, and without starting such a controversy -- at least the guy identified himself -- see all the articles now about "stealth" reviewers puffing or destroying books as part of an agenda. Come on guys, give the author a break!</span>

                    <span>Unethical review practices aside, this book isn't that great. I had a look at Borders and I was not impressed by either the content nor its organization. Of all the InDesign CS books I've seen (or seen described so far), Scott Kelby's interests me the most... essentially because he does such good work on his Photoshop books that I know a certain level of quality will be achieved there.</span>

                    <span>I agree...it's completely lame for the author to review his own book. Looking things over including the author's site it's clear that he may have the technical skills but has terrible design skills. Check out his site for a demo of his work as he suggests...<P>This book would be a waste of your time and money.</span>

                    <span>I haven't used this book, don't plan to, and certainly will never buy it.<P>Why?<P>If these reviews are to mean ANYTHING to users (that's you and me), we can't have the author review his own book and give it a 5-star (or any star) rating. How bankrupt!<P>Bergsland should be ashamed of himself. And so should Amazon for allowing this to happen. His "review" should be deleted and his five stars erased.<P>I want to know what actual users have encountered with this book, or any book. I don't need the author's puffed-up opinion of his work, and a phony 5-star rating.<P>Appalling.<P>Lawrence A. Monical</span>

                    <span>How to Do Everything with Adobe InDesign CS serves as both a reference and step-by-step learning manual. Through numerous illustrations, it guides you through set up procedures, setting preferences and production shortcuts that are invaluable to the beginner and production users alike. Particularly valuable to seasoned InDesign users are the references to new features in the CS version. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning InDesign and to professionals that are upgrading to this new version of the software.</span>
