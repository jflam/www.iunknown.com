                <span id="Label1">A tantalizing, droll study of the idiosyncratic existence of the very rich, through the unexpected lens of the naturalist.   <P>Journalist Richard Conniff probes the age-old question "Are the rich different from you and me?" and finds that they are indeed a completely different animal. He observes with great humor and finesse this socially unique species, revealing their strategies for ensuring dominance and submission, their flourishes of display behavior, the intricate dynamics of their pecking order, as well as their unorthodox mating practices. Through comparisons to other equally exotic animals, Conniff uncovers surprising commonalties.   <P>&#149; How did Bill Gates achieve his single greatest act of social dominance by being nice? &#149; How does the flattery of the rich resemble the grooming behavior of baboons?  &#149; What made the British aristocracy the single most successful animal dominance hierarchy in the history of the planet?  &#149; How does Old Money's disdain for the nouveaux riches resemble the pig-grunting of mountain gorillas?  <P>This marvelously entertaining field guide captures in vivid detail the behaviors and habitats of the world's most captivating yet elusive animal. 29 photographs.</span>

                    <span>Richard Conniff's book on the habits of the rich is presented as a joke right from the start. He's decided to compare theories of evolutionary biology in the animal kingdom to the behavior of rich people, but he's not trying to be scientific about it. That tongue-in-cheek approach makes this book very easy to read. It's always light and often funny.<P>But Conniff covers two basic ideas over and over. See, the rich like to display their wealth the same way that a peacock displays its colorful tail. And all rich people want to be "alphas" just silverback gorillas in the jungle. That's it. That's the whole book, summed up in two sentences.<P>Conniff's idea that the rich are the fittest of the species is very weak. He disregards the fact that rich people inherit their wealth. If they didn't earn it, there's no reason to think they are the best of the best. Rich people aren't examples of alphas, either. Their displays of wealth are often impractical, hard to read, and too easy to copy among the general population. For example, when everyone has an SUV, rich people can't show off their wealth by driving an SUV. So they get Hummers. But Hummers seem too impractical to generate envy among ordinary people, so the display of wealth doesn't work.<P>These complications make the book a bit of a joke, which Conniff acknowledges right from the start. So if you want to read a light, humorous book of anecdotes about rich people throwing parties --- juxtaposed with anecdotes about plumage and gorillas --- this is the book for you. But you don't like wasting time, you should probably read something else.</span>

                    <span>Richard Conniff has pulled off a real coup - a (very) funny book that also makes you think. I'm sure it is easier to enjoy not being among the super-rich he both chronicles and compares to our primate "relatives" and to other animal species, but even the "subject group" won't be able to resist his observations.</span>

                    <span>What shocked me most about this book is how... smart it is! The author, Richard Conniff, writes for everything from "National Geographic" to "Architectural Digest" and is obviously "in the know" on the side. As a result, he comes off as very intelligent and witty, and I learned more about animal behavior than I did about human behavior.<P>Yes, it is a very witty book. But it also has a serious streak. He backs up his stories of gluttony and excess with anecdotal science from the natural world. He adds just enough history of the rich to provide a firm background and to show that some things just never change.<P>You might be embarrassed to be seen reading it, but it's definately worth picking up. It's fascinating to see how the other .0001% live, and I guarentee you'll learn something.</span>

                    <span>We are interested in what rich people do. They make the big homes, and the big deals, and have the fanciest clothes and the best choice in dates. We enjoy it when they do things that are silly, stupid, or mistaken. In doing so, we are really doing nothing more than our hominid ancestors did in paying close attention to the chiefs of their tribes; they may not have had money back then, but they had the status and they were carefully watched because of it. Interest in the rich is programmed in our genes. Thus it is a delight to find that the rich can be studied as objects of natural curiosity. Richard Conniff usually writes about other species, but has taken the techniques of the naturalist to study the habits of _homo sapiens peconiosus_ (rich people) in _The Natural History of the Rich: A Field Guide_ (Norton). He writes that instead of animals in the field, he "... had found a new quarry, and they were possibly the most dangerous and elusive animals on earth." Throughout his witty and informative book, he shows a great sense of fun with his evaluation of this extraordinary species.<P>Conniff gives us many views of rich people acting like animals. The analogies are often easily drawn and obvious. This should not be surprising. Successful tribal animals from all species are driven by "the quest for control, dominance, mating opportunities, and, above all, status." The rich are predatory like jungle cats, or busy with penile displays, like monkeys. It seems that many rich men are addicted to peeing in relatively public places as a show of domination. Ted Turner, who shows up often in this book, gave away a billion dollars to the UN, and disdained his fellow rich people who weren't, in his opinion, doing their share, as he quite ostentatiously was. A virtue is more of a virtue if it is performed privately and not for show, but the rich don't play the game that way any more than other primates do; what he had done was make a "bid for status, as plain as the chest-thumping of rival silverback gorillas." The rich maintain that they already have it made and they don't have any need to impress anyone, but that's not the way they behave: "...they usually mean only that they have drastically narrowed down the list of people they are interested in impressing." Other rich people, or ghosts of doubting fathers or teachers. <P>Part of the fun of the book is that Conniff knows a wealth of examples to draw upon, and there is lots to learn about what we usually take to be animals as well as rich people. For instance, in discussing the way rich men have arranged for other men not to make attempts on their wives ("mate guarding"), he informs us about dragon flies. Anyone who has seen dragonflies knows that they spend some of their time flying in tandem, with the male locked onto the female. It is wrong to assume they are enjoying in-flight coitus; probably they already got that out of the way, but the male is sticking to his mate until she lays her eggs so that other males don't get to her beforehand. So various behaviors of the rich (kin selection, altruism, status symbols, territoriality, scent marking, hoarding) amusingly can be found in some much lower species. The ease of the analogies is partially due to the baroque variations of behavior found all over the animal kingdom; one can find some species somewhere doing almost anything, and another doing the opposite. In fact, when analogizing the way rich grooms give presents to brides, Conniff tells about the male hangingfly who presents an edible morsel to a prospective mate, but warns, "The leap from hangingflies to humans is of course perilous." Just so, but such leaps are entertaining as well. Conniff's examination of the rich is not a scientific study as much as it is a bunch of funny stories about how odd those rich people are, stories made funnier by finding that they behave in ways just like other animals do.</span>

                    <span>Richard Conniff is one of my favorite writers and this current offering is just as intellectually stimulating and entertaining as any of his previous works. Enjoy a walk on the wild side while Mr. Conniff explores our animal nature as it pertains to the most wealthy among us. Travel back to a time when wealth was not measured in monetary terms as we know it now but in such things as exotic foods offered to guests and how great a party you could throw. Insightful theories as to how the rich became rich and how they remain rich coupled with the observation of behaviors that echo our ape ancestors sets this literary effort apart from your usual sociological exploration. This well written and humorous effort deserves a standing ovation and a cry of BRAVO!</span>
