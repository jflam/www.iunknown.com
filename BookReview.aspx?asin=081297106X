                    <span>The book is unique in that it is a memoir and a commentary on literary works. It is about the writer's life in Tehran, during the eighties and the nineties and interspersed in her memoir are her comments on western literature and authors such as Nabokov, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James and Jane Austen. I believe the writer was trying to let the reader see a link between fiction and reality. <p>The first few pages led me to believe that the book was going to be about the members of the secret book discussion group which met at the writer's house for two years. The theme of the writer's English literature classes was the relation between fiction and reality. <p>I was fascinated by the writer's experiences: teaching western literature during a time when anything western was labeled indecent and decadent, surviving the eight year war between Iraq and Iran and deciding to migrate to United States. The book opened my eyes about the strength and courage of Middle Eastern women and in particular, Iranian women. <p>Nafisi painted a picture of religion being used as an instrument of power that intruded in the personal lives of Iranians after the departure of the Shah. There was an example of some young ladies being reprimanded for eating apples too seductively. She painted a clear picture of chaos in education at the university level where leftists and Islamists frequently clashed on campus reflecting the drama and chaos in the Iranian society where the leftists, Islamists and Monarchists battled each other.<p>Ultimately, this is a well-written and wonderful book. Not only is it about survival of the human spirit, it's a book that celebrate many passions, reading among them. Pick up a copy! Another very different, but highly enjoyable recent Amazon purchase I enjoyed was The Losers Club: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez.</span>

                    <span>Actually, this novel is better than the title suggests.  It is about the healing and redemptive power of fiction that enables one to cope with life, however mundane or horrifying.  The author holds a secret class at her home, teaching Western literature to a group of students, cloistered, as if in a mosque, while modern-day Iran is plunged into violence, brutality, censorship and chaos.  The group's discussions reveal the stark and desperate lives of its members, and that is where the novel excels.  But too often, the author lapses into simplistic and self-reverential analyses of the novels that she teaches; it's as if she uses this novel to seek the readers' approval of her literary criticism.  In the end, this remarkable story of Iran and the lives of certain of her people are overwhelmed by the author's solipsistic musings.          </span>

                    <span>It has been quite a while that I have read a story which so captivated me. It is quite a revealing book that will make many readers cringe. I like the character development, the fast pace at which the story flows, the setting and the sophisticated but clear plot.
<br />
<br />I like the way the author did the narration. The voice is strong and clear. Poetic and fast flowing, one easily gets into the story  and has no difficulty relating to the story. I recommend this book to all.Recommended stories are  DISCIPLES OF FORTUNE,TALES OF BURNING LOVE, THE KITE RUNNER in the sense that they go to add to this rich theme.</span>

                    <span>Reading the reviews, I was excited to start this book.  I am disappointed to say that it was horrible.  The author is one the most pretentious, condescending "teachers" I have ever come across.  I think most people have said they "love" this book because they don't want to admit that they can't follow the memoir and her tirades on Nabokov and Fitzgerald's works. It's too bad.  There really could have been something great here with the interesting premise.  Great title, bad book.</span>
