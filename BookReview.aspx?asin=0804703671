                    <span>It's hard to believe that what is written down in this book ir real.  But, real it is.  Once you start reading it you can't put it down.  It holds you spellbound.  Pulls at your heartstrings as you read what this party had to  go through.  It would be impossible today for people to stand up to what  these people did.  This book is well worth the reading.  These people had  the strength, fortitude that is seldom found today.</span>

                    <span>While certainly a worthwile book on the tragedy of the Donner Party, the book does have its weaknesses.  Specifically, McGlashan's research is less than objective.  As George Stewart points out in his better book on the subject, "Ordeal By Hunger," McGlashan was very sloppy with his facts.  His personal friendship with a few of the Donner Party survivors also biases his writing.  Still, the book is a very important read for those interested in this historic tragedy.  For the money, though, Stewart's book is the better choice</span>

                    <span>The McGlashan book has been in print almost continuously for nearly 120 years.  While not the entire story, it is still the book against which all Donner Party stories are measured.  It is a compelling story of the classic American tragedy of the western migration, showing the many complex sides of the individuals involved in the story.  It is mandatory reading for anyone interested in our western history</span>
