                <span id="Label1">With <I>The Da Vinci Code,</I> Dan Brown masterfully concocts an intelligent and lucid thriller that marries the gusto of an international murder mystery with a collection of fascinating esoteria culled from 2,000 years of Western history. <p>  A murder in the silent after-hour halls of the Louvre museum reveals a sinister plot to uncover a secret that has been protected by a clandestine society since the days of Christ. The victim is a high-ranking agent of this ancient society who, in the moments before his death, manages to leave gruesome clues at the scene that only his granddaughter, noted cryptographer Sophie Neveu, and Robert Langdon, a famed symbologist, can untangle. The duo become both suspects and detectives searching for not only Neveu's grandfather's murderer but also the stunning secret of the ages he was charged to protect. Mere steps ahead of the authorities and the deadly competition, the mystery leads Neveu and Langdon on a breathless flight through France, England, and history itself.   Brown (<I>Angels and Demons</I>) has created a page-turning thriller that also provides an amazing interpretation of Western history. Brown's hero and heroine embark on a lofty and intriguing exploration of some of Western culture's greatest mysteries--from the nature of the Mona Lisa's smile to the secret of the Holy Grail. Though some will quibble with the veracity of Brown's conjectures, therein lies the fun. <I>The Da Vinci Code</I> is an enthralling read that provides rich food for thought. <I>--Jeremy Pugh</I></span>

                    <span>Exasperating... this is the only word I can find to describe this insult to the writing art. It could be forgiven only if it was the work of a budding 14 years old aspiring writer.. The characters are stereotypical mannequins monstruosly bumping aroud in a shallow, totally unrealistic plot devoid of any originality. The Harvard professor is shy and reserved, the english lord is snob and the french cryptologist.. well she is hot! Inconsistencies and blunders are scattered all over the place, and leave you in this strange state when you don't know if you want to throw the book away in a fit of rage or have a great laugh at such an helpless author. The Harvad professor and the cryptologist together have the brain of a turnip, fighting hard to solve little riddles that would be a joke for kid. But what made really burts with laughter was the choice of the super secret passord that should have securely guarded the cryptex (basically a bycicle lock) containing the precious Holy Grail secret.. the Gran Master chose his grandaughter's name! Anyone who has even a slight familirity with security knows that a loved person name is the first and most obvious and stupid password choice of a dummy! :)
<br />Another comical side is the attitude of Langdon and Sophie towards feelings and sex... when you read that Sophie has interrupted all contact with her beloved grandfather you imagine all sort of violent things..murder.. pedophily, ..rape and it finally turns out she just caught him giving a "ride" to a middle aged plump lady? Coooooome on!!!! And ok, you had to have a couple to make the story just a bit more stereotypical.. but at least make something reaistic, comlex and deep happen! No, by the end of the story Langdon and Sophie share only a timid kiss "full of promise". Is the author a teenager or just trying to win the favours of the neo-con prude wave?
<br />And the final blow.. at the end of all that road, the little secrets and passords and riddles.. there is nothing like the Grail but just a happy family reunion! In the best tradition of old telenovelas....
<br />Citing a really trashy italian TV show I could yell "Carramba che Sorpresa!".</span>

                    <span>After the hype, hysteria and all that time on the best-seller list, I was expecting something fairly spectacular (or at least, something as good as 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'). At that, it took a cardinal bad-mouthing it to get me to buy and read it. Luckily, the used bookstore will take it on a trade-in - only about 100 pages used. <br>The book reads like 'Robert Ludlum meets Judith Krantz meets Dean Koontz', not a happy combination. Is this really what passes for a 'best seller' these days? Or were all those people reading it because it was trendy?</span>

                    <span>First I thought the novel was well-executed and this is helped by the short viginette chapters. The wall paper of Europe and religious history is a nice decoration but the focus is on the myth. And that is all this is. Ther claim of truth at the beginning is misinterpreted in my view. The paintings are real as are the locations. The entities are real but in the case of the Priory of Sion is a debunked sham. Making it real for the novel is allowed though. 
<br />
<br />The problem is that this was already written in two other novels and all of the themes are indentical in the two books. Enough was changed to make the claim of originality in the form of character names and the title of the main thesis: Jesus married Mary Magdalene and they have descendants protecting her bones and legacy. From the looks of things and the attention this is the only declaration that separates the books in question. This one and "Daughter of God."
<br />
<br />Is that enough? Who knows?</span>

                    <span>     Brown manages to turn beautiful artwork into something different.  He suggests that there are hidden messages and unsolved mysteries behind the works of Leonardo Da Vinci.
<br />     Dan Brown's book, The Da Vinci Code, is deserving of a four-star rating, because he begins the book with quite a few suspenseful moments, and keeps the reader's attention.  He also raises many interesting questions about Da Vinci and the Bible.  There have been several newspaper articles, reviews, and even television shows, such as Dateline, that have discussed this book.
<br />     The story is very interesting.  Robert Langdon, a notable symbolist, and Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist are trying to solve the murder of a much respected curator at the Louvre.  Before the curator died, he left random clues to a secret that only he knew, a secret that he did not want to die with him.  Now, Robert and Sophie must race against time and the police, while solving the puzzle.  If they are too late the secret will fall into the wrong hands.
<br />     The book starts out well, but throughout the course of the story Brown tends to get carried away and seems to lose the interest of the reader with several confusing plot twists.  The end is also very boring.  With the way the story is built up, one would expect a more climatic ending.  
<br />     This book remains a best seller almost two years after it was published.  Brown raises some controversial questions regarding the Catholic Church and the Bible.  Steven Spielberg is going to direct the movie and it will be interesting to see how it is portrayed on the big screen.

                    <span>I don't think anyone who tryies to take this book as "gospel" will enjoy it. I don't think that is the intention of the book. I really enjoyed the story and found myself captivated by the plot. It was very well read. For those who enjoy a murder/mystery - you will enjoy this book. </span>
