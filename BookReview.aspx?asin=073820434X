                    <span>Dr. Sadler has helped my plan for my transition from my first and second ages (achieving, accomplishing what others wanted from me) to my third age where it is OK to do things that I want to do. <br>The book provided me with suggestions for carrying out this transition and research and examples to convince me of the potential of this period of time in my life.<br>I would recommend it to any one who is contemplating retirement and is unsure of his or her next steps.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Sadler has articulated a comprehensive approach for anyone over 40 to contemplate more personal fulfillment in life. This is particularly timely research and analysis as the U.S. is transformed by the wave of baby boomers just beginning to reach traditional retirement age. Boomers will, on average, live longer, more healthy lives than any previous generation. We cannot simply accept that life is "downhill after 50" when there is now a "30-year life bonus" opportunity in front of us.<p>Dr. Sadler's six principles provide a sound basis for understanding and exploring the concept of personal fulfillment and his wonderful individual stories of people he followed for many years help us see these principles in action.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be stimulating and encouraging - rather than focus, as so many books do, on traditional concepts of 'aging' and 'retirement' as end points of life, this book illuminates the extraordinary opportunities for growth that can be available to those who permit themselves to take advantage of them. I've read it several times; with each reading, I see more parallels with my life. I would recommend it to anyone reluctant to surrender to stagnation and interested in learning about some remarkable, and clearly real, people.</span>

                    <span>This is a terrific book for anyone, such as myself, in or approaching our"third age".  Dr.Sadler looks at real people and their experiences in creating productive and joyous lives despite the challenges they faced.  While not everything that comes our way is easy, we have a wonderful opportunity to experience re-growth and design a new life for ourselves.  A previous reviewer was somewhat disparaging of this book and its ideas and observations, but many of his or her comments do not accurately represent the information provided in the book and stand in marked contrast to other reviews provided.  I urge an interested reader to read this book and reach your own conclusions.  It will be worth your time.</span>

                    <span>This is the kind of book you would never buy in a bookstore. Flip through a few pages and see thin and brief "case studies," which frankly ring hollow and maybe aren't true. Advice given at the end of each chapter is flip and insulting: "develop a sense of humor" "take better care of yourself physically" and so on. Also, there are some really far-fetched points the author seems intent on making over and over chapter after chapter. Women losing estrogen can become more feminine and masculine at the same time. Same goes for men. Right. Another nonsensical point the author harps on relentlessly is that this generation has been given 30 more years to live, to 100 years old, unlike all previous generations. Clearly, that is not fact based on statistics. The worst part of this oddball book is that everyone "over 40" is relegated to the Third Age which also includes 90 and 100 year olds, so as you can imagine, lots of fighting cancer and disease issues. And, finally, way too many stories of women who left husbands in the Third Age to live with other women and find true happiness. Yuck!</span>
