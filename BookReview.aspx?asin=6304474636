                    <span>This documentary of the lives of lions and hyenas is one of the best made documentaries I've seen. You will become acquainted with the inhabitants of this film and witness the drama of a secret world where the law of the jungle is harsh, yet profoundly beautiful. You will see never before seen footage of hyena behavior. You will cheer and be swept up in this film. It is a story that is real and beautifully shot. I have watched this film many times since buying it. If you like wildlife you will love this one. It is at times disturbing but shot honestly and with care. Very enjoyable.</span>

                    <span>The better filmmakers all pour their hearts and souls into their work. But the best filmmakers never allow that fact to distort or discolor the topic they're filming. Indeed, the hard work that produces the best films brings clarity and insight to the fundamental essence of the subject matter, not the filmmaker's personal agenda, ego or annoying idiosyncracies. <P>Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas is absolutely outstanding. In it, Derek and Beverly Joubert reveal the interaction of Africa's super predators; with each other, with themselves and with the animals on which they prey.<P>Film footage is nothing short of stunning. It is up close and personal, and it is real. And, if my understanding is correct, the Jouberts never availed themselves of the protection of a heavy caliber rifle, a choice that few people would make. Narration is superb, thoughtfully written and insightful it is never excessive and it complements, never intrudes upon, the film subject. There is absolutely none of the fever-pitched, breathless hype that permeates the mainstream media.<P>Make no mistake about it lions and hyenas are surely predators and (as are all predators) are genetically programmed killing machines. But just as surely the natural hunting process is amoral and there is truly no right or wrong to the relationship between prey and predator. But if Lions & Hyenas is graphic, it is not pre-meditatedly sensationalistic. There is no sense of the exploitation or sensationalism that permeates the liberal mainstream media. Simply put, to a much greater degree than almost anything else produced by today's filmmakers, Lions & Hyenas is simple, objective reality, brought to video honestly, beautifully and wholly without ulterior motives.<P>Lions and Hyenas is a masterpiece of cinematic documentation that aspires to genuine art without deviating from the fundamental purpose of providing fact-based knowledge and insight. It is unsurpassed.</span>

                    <span>then be prepared for some of the most spectacular and disturbing footage ever caught on film. From the outset it is made brutally clear that animals, in this case lions and hyaenas, DO in fact slaughter each other, not necessarily for food as most people believe, but for something much darker - HATRED.<P>This point is made by showing a large male lion, Ntwydmala, breaking the back of an unlucky hyaena matriarch, then shortly afterwards, breaking the neck of another. It isn't always pleasant to watch, but it'll keep you glued to your seat in disbelief.<P>This film is easily one of the best nature films I've ever seen, bar none!</span>

                    <span>Being a long time nature program viewer, I can easily say this might be the most fascinating video ever presented on TV. The interaction & violence between lions and hyenas is unforgettable.<BR>Like watching man wage war and retribution. Beautifully photographed and narrated. But not for young children. Also stronly recommend the book which is a companion to the video.</span>

                    <span>This is the best National Geographic Film ever made! The narrator and film crew give the Hyenas and Lions human like qualities which leaves you taking side with one or the other. It is a humorous, heartbreaking and excellent educational tool for those wanting to learn more about the cycle of life of these two eternal enemies. I would advise parental guidance for this film due to some of the graphic scences in which the animals fight and feast.</span>
