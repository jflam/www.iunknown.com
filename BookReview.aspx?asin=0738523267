                    <span>This is an exceptionally poor book.  Fact are wrong (Green Mile for Green Mill nite club), locations are wrong (Chicago Theater does not have a back door on Walbash)  Seem to be a clip and paste effort done mostly from old newspaper clippings. How anyone could write about the prohibition era and not mention Canadian Ace, or the DeLisa brothers, or Botchie Conners or Jimmy Sterch or Nattie Trigger or ... the list could go on as long as the book.  At least Asbury's book on Chicago crime spoke of such ancient history that even though you knew it was a hack job it was amusing. This is too bad as no one to my knowledge has done any real interviewing of the  survivors of the real outfit. Serragusa could have supplied a wealth of information, if he had been cultivated.  All in all, just a little better than the cheap sensationalism of Jack Lait. </span>

                    <span>the book is good to look at, he just used all photos on ever page. There is no new info in this book. Its not a very good book if you want to read about the Chicago mob.</span>

                    <span>Leave it to Chicago's own John Binder to weave an excellent and complete history of the Chicago Mob from Colosimo, Torrio and Capone to Accardo and Giancana and on through the Outfit's waning days in the 1990's. It's a remarkable study and the many rare photos alone are an indispensible addition to any Mob buff's collection. West Side Jack's done his homework! </span>

                    <span>John Binder's "The Chicago Outfit" is a must-have for any serious researcher's library. The pictures and commentary bring an era and its criminals to life like no other work has done, so I'm anxious to see what this author can do with a full-length work on the same subject.</span>

                    <span>John Binder rates among Chicago Gangland's most knowledgeable researchers.  Those seeking information about the area's sordid past will not be disappointed by Binder's knowledgeable text and extraordinary photographs.  His first book is an informative and delightful read - let's hope it's not his last!</span>
