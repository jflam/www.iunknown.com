                    <span>Jackie Robinson, Bravest Man In Baseball is a biography about how he became the first African-American to play in the MLB.  It starts out in Jackie's childhood in Georgia.  When he was a kid he was good at all different kinds of sports such as basketball and track.  When he played sports he always picked the little kids who weren't as great as everyone else so he could help them improve.  Every kid on the block wanted to play on his team.
<br />     I think Margaret Davidson's message was you can do what ever you set your mind to.  Meaning if you want to be the first woman in the MLB you can.  You just have to be ready for what's in store for you just like Jackie.
<br />     I liked this book a lot because  baseball is my favorite hobby.  I also like to read about some of my favorite baseball players.  I loved this so much because I can relate to a lot of this book.  And I got to learn all about the great Jackie Robinson. </span>

                    <span>The Story of Jackie Robinson: Bravest Man in Baseball is about the struggles of one black man who made a big difference.  Jackie Robinson was a great athlete in college but was not let into the Major Leagues because his skin was black.  Robinson played on the Brooklyn Dodgers in the "Noble Experiment" which was meant Jackie being the first black on a white team.  His team looked down on him because of the color of his skin.  When the fans yelled slurs at him and other teams yelled at him it overwhelmed the Dodgers.  They finally stood up for Robinson.  I recommend this wonderful book, Jackie Robinson: Bravest Man in Baseball because it has a lot of action and emotion.</span>

                    <span>The Story of Jackie Robinson, Bravest Man in Baseball is about the struggles of one black man who never gave up.  Jackie Robinson was a great athlete in college but he couldn't play Major League baseball because of the color of his skin.  When Jackie Robinson played on the Brooklyn Dodgers he was part of the "Noble Experiment" and his teammates were unfriendly.  Also fans yelled slurs at Jackie.  In 1947 Jackie Robinson won Rookie of the year and the admiration of the American people.  I recommend this book because it tells how Jackie Robinson was a great athlete and a brave person.</span>

                    <span>The Story of Jackie Robinson: Bravest Man in Baseball is about the struggles of one black man who never gave up.  Jackie Robinson was a great athlete in college and wanted to go to the Major's but they wouldn't let him because he was black.  The general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey took a chance on Jackie.  Rickey said would let him play if he didn't fight back over racial slurs and attacks.  This was known as the "Noble Experiment".  Jackie's team looked down on him and fans harassed him because of the color of his skin.  At last everybody realized Robinson was a great guy and that the color of a person's skin doesn't mater.   In the end Jackie Robinson won the admiration of all American people.  I think that you should read this book because it shows someone with great courage.</span>

                    <span>The Story of Jackie Robinson, Bravest Man in Baseball is about Robinsonï¿½s struggles in life and in baseball.  Robinson was great at all sports but he couldnï¿½t play in the Majors after college because he was black.  Four years later in 1945 Jackie Robinson was the first black player to play in the Major League because of a man named Branch Rickey.  This was known as the ï¿½Noble Experimentï¿½ and it did a lot of good all over the U.S.  At first the Brooklyn Dodgers team was very angry that Robinson was playing with them and the fans had more hatred for the poor man. However, Robinson won the Rookie of the Year and also won lots of Americans admiration.  If you enjoy baseball I think you would like this book because it shows the history of how blacks were finally accepted into the Major Leagues thanks to Jackie Robinson!</span>
