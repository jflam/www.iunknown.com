                <span id="Label1">This book is a recipe-based approach to using the CVS Version Control system that will get you up and running quickly--and correctly.  All projects need version control: it's one of the foundational pieces of any project's infrastructure.  Yet half of all project teams in the U.S. don't use any version control at all. Many others don't use it well, and end up experiencing time-consuming problems. This book describes a practical, easy to follow way of using CVS, the most commonly used version control system in the world.  Instead of presenting the grand Theory of Version Control and describing every possible option (whether you'd ever use it or not), this book focuses on the practical application of CVS. It builds a set of examples of use that parallel the life of typical projects, showing you how to adopt and then enhance your pragmatic use of CVS.</span>

                    <span>I read this book cover-to-cover in two days. Don't mistake this as the book being lightweight. This book captures the essentials for using CVS in small, medium, and large projects. I've used CVS since  1997 in various aspects. In my experience, the authors present material that I've learned over the last eight years in an easy-to-read and easy-to-digest format. They touch on the basics, but the basics are really all many organizations need. I have been involved with projects where complex branching and tagging schemes were devised, which makes it hard to focus on actually writing code; you spend too much time dealing with bookkeeping, etc. The authors provide a no-nonsense way of using branches and tags that makes sense and is easy to grasp. This book is no replacement for some of the other CVS books out there that tend to focus on all aspects of CVS (administartion, coding, etc.) but if all you want is a great introduction to 97% of what you need to know as a developer, then get this book!</span>

                    <span>This is a first-rate introduction to CVS.  In fact, it may be that everything you ever need to know about CVS is in this book.  This book covers version control basics, paradigm differences, branches, merging, and all of the 'basic' version control tools.  It then provides 'recipes' (boiler plate) for common operations to simplify things.  This book has perhaps two shortcomings: first, it doesn't cover all of the features of CVS.  The authors can be forgiven for stating their prejudices, particularly since they coincide with mine, but I think completeness is worth something so ignoring the features that are deemed of less worth is probably not the best. Second, this book doesn't cover the GUI interfaces.  The GUI's should be easy to figure out, and the command line is certainly where it's at for scripting, but I think there are a lot of folks who would like at least a WinCVS appendix.  Overall, very recommended, but it won't make you a *complete* CVS guru.</span>

                    <span>Not sure what I'm missing. These books are thin in more than the physical way. This one has a few decent ideas. Actually, my big beefs with this book are:
<br />
<br />1. Most of this information is just freely available. Look at this as a search prevention mechanism.
<br />
<br />2. If you use a tool with great CVS support (like Eclipse 3), literally 2/3 of the book is completely superfluous. 
<br />
<br />3. If you don't use a tool w/great support, get that for free, not this, you'll end up much farther down the road.
<br />
<br />Why not put ideas into a book like this? For instance, Vincent Massol's recent article about automating a process of publishing diffs to keep people up to date. Or looking at some of the many interesting OS addons like CVSList. This is literally just one more book that sells you something you already have ready access to.</span>

                    <span>(The following is an excerpt of a review of "The Pragmatic Starter Kit" I posted at JavaRanch.)
<br />
<br />Authors, David Thomas and Andrew Hunt, smashed a home run with their book, "Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS" - the first volume in the three part "The Pragmatic Starter Kit" series.  Using easy to read explanations, examples and stories, this book clearly explains what version control is, how it works, why folks are using it, how CVS works, and what commands developers are using during the life of their projects.  "Pragmatic Version Control Using CVS" provides the semantics and idioms behind the syntax found in the CVS Manual.  Before reading this book, I was a timid CVS user, willing to do little more than check code out.  Now, after reading the book, I check code out and in, branch, merge and resolve conflicts with confidence.  I'd recommend this book to any developer using a version control system that wouldn't already describe themselves as Zen masters in the craft, and to any developer not already using a version control system.

                    </div>
                    <span>Hunt and Thomas, "The Pragmatic Programmers", provide a delightfully brief user's guide for the Concurrent Version System (CVS).  They focus on idiomatic usage patterns, leading the way from installing CVS and creating a first project to branching for releases and developer sandboxes.  They provide practical advice on when to branch, how to comment, what constitutes a project, and even what to check into CVS in the first place.  I've been using CVS for years, and learned a lot here; especially about the various kinds of diff reporting and configuration options.<p>Almost everyone is confused by CVS first.  Almost everyone who gets over the learning curve swears by it (or some variant). The main adoption hurdle is the unix-style documentation that provides telegraphic explanations of commands in insider jargon.  Hunt and Thomas explain what it all means, and more importantly, how to use it, and why to use it.  Complex relationships like merge conflicts are illustrated with clear diagrams and sensible easy-to-follow examples.  Even though I see myself using this book quite a bit, I could've used it even more when I was getting started, before CVS became second nature.</span>
