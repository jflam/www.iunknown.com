                    <span>Most of the advice in this book is just merely a guide, a concept of understanding of money and the society that we live in. For example, limit your liabilities and increase your asset is good advice. No, I would not take his advice word for word but his concept is sound and solid. I give him 3 stars for at least trying to bring awareness about how money works. 
<br />
<br />As an observer and participant of Silicon Valley tech industry, I noticed that many successful participants of the tech industry started out working for someone, learned the trade, took some risk, built his/her start ups, IPOed or sold out, gain some fame and move on to become an investor or venture capitalist-- from employee to owner to investor---followed similar path to Robert Kiyosaki's thesis. 
<br />
<br />What is not shown in many advice books is the holy grail of capitalism; how to make the first million, as in everything the first big break is the hardest to achieve. Perhaps because this vital first is the hardest to teach since people have different approaches to reaching their "first" based on talents, opportunities and circumstances. My personal advice is still, "invest" in what you are passionate and good at since all of us have different interest and talents.  </span>

                    <span>I think this book is a great guide, it makes you think, it makes you aspire.  An yes maybe all of us are not destined to get rich but there are some of us that are and this book gives you an insight of how to get there.  I have been an employee all my adult life and have changes jobs several time, each time with a nice salary increase and yes each time paying more and more taxes, I am considered the middle class, hard working, good employee, educated to the max, but in reality if we continue to live that way we will never accomplish much we will still sit and admire the Trump's of the world and wonder how they got where they are.  This book gives a look into that world and that it is possible to get there or at lease give you kids a fighting chance to get there instead of doing what we all do, work for the shareholders of the company we work for and in the end what do we get in return, some of us gets laid off, some loose their retirement and more.  This book is simply lending a hand on how to think for ourselves and take care of what we have and not just go from employer to employer trying to achieve wealth because it will not likely happen.  Now many of you keep stressing of Robert saying to forget a good education, it is really sad if that is all you take away from this book.  If my memory serves me he did say that he had no issues with education, what he had issues with is what they prepare us for, to get a "GOOD JOB".  This book is a must read and it is not a manual or a get rich scheme it is merely a guide to awaken ones mind.</span>

                    <span>For the most part, it seems that people either love or hate the book and now having read it, I think I understand why. Most likely it seems that it depends on your personal situation and knowledge prior to reading the book.
<br />
<br />I think that if you were someone who was just making ends meet, using all of your salary to support your lifestyle (in Kiyosakian parlance, buying "liabilities") and doing little to save and invest (buying "assets"), I can see that this book might serve as a wake up call and can inspire and motivate people to look for ways to possibly change their situation. Furthermore, the book's various claims, (however misleading or unrealistic as I point out below) plays right into such people's desires to learn the "secret of success" of the rich that if only they knew, they could quit (or abandon their plans) to go to school, quit their jobs and just invest and live off of investments the rest of their lives without working.
<br />
<br />OTOH, if like many of us, you were making a good salary WORKING but spending responsibly (i.e. limiting "liabilities) and meanwhile trying to invest aggressively as much as we know how to do based on our unique circumstances and preferences (buying "assets"), the book really provides no substance and stretches credibility. For us, you don't need inspiration and what specific info the book provides is either dated, incorrect, or misleading. Also for many of us, we didn't read it realizing ahead of time that it was entirely a motivational book rather than a "methods" book since the title alludes to "methods" that that rich possess that we of humbler backgrounds lack.
<br />
<br />This book makes fantastic claims. There is a quick and easy "secret of success" that "the rich" (always treated as a monolithic group) know and the rest of us don't; this "secret information" is far more important than hard work, getting a good education, investing wisely, or any traditional method to become rich and successful; and if you only learn "the secret" (translation: buy Kiyosaki's book) you, too, will be rich.
<br />
<br />According to Kiyosaki, "the rich" become rich by using three different strategies: 1). They form and own corporations, thus paying less taxes than people who get their income as employees. 2). They invest in real estate in certain "secret" ways that let them earn a lot of money with little risk or tax liability; 3). They use tips from friends for insider's trading to make a killing in the stock market. Kiyosaki's advice, in essence, is to suggest to the reader to emulate "the rich" by using the same tax-avoidance strategies, real-estate schemes, and insider's trading "they" supposedly use to get rich.
<br />
<br />There are only two tiny problems with Kiyosaki's advice. First of all, these "secret strategies" are NOT the way the rich actually make money; it is rather the LAYMAN'S IMPRESSION of how the rich make money, an impression based mainly on numerous TV shows and movies which portray "the rich" in this way. As the (excellent) book "the millionaire next door" shows, this description bears no more relation to how the rich actually make money than James Bond films have to actual espionage work.
<br />
<br />Second, not surprisingly, the "strategies" Kiyosaki proposes could work only in the movies - where, of course, the government and police are all in the millionaire's pocket, and let him "get away with it". If you actually try them in the real world, you will be laughed at, waste your time and money, get audited by the IRS, or worse.
<br />
<br />For example, in reality, coroprations are *not* good tax shelters. In reality, you *cannot* deduct your personal expenses as "business expenses", or have your corporation give you "tax-free gifts" such as trips to Hawai or Rolex watches, as Kiyosaki claims. Doing so would get you audited and stiffly fined (or worse.) Also, in reality, "insider's trading" is a felony which could land you in jail. Finally, in reality, Koyisaki's real-estate advice is either illegal (as in his claim of using his cat as a "business partner"), immoral (as in getting "good deals" from unsophisticated sellers, apparently based on the principle of "it is immoral to let a sucker keep his money"), or doesn't work in the real world (such as his claims that he offered 275K for a 450K building and "they agreed to 300K", or that a bank agreed to take 50K instead of 60K for property he bought "simply because it was a cashier's check.")...This book, in summary, paints a fantasy picture of the world, and gives "financial advice" that will make you a laughing stock at best and put you in jail for insider's trading or tax evasion at worse.
<br />
<br />If you have dreams of being the next Gates, Trump, etc, I'd say go for it. But don't give up your day job just yet based on Kiyosaki's fantasy notions because the real world doesn't work that way. The bottom line is that whether you work hard at a profession as an employee or whether you work hard to invest and build businesses, you will need to work. It is safe to say that while a few people will be able to invest and build businesses and live off of their assets without working, many of us won't be able to pull it off. There's nothing wrong with trying but don't do it with the mistaken notion that you'll automatically be better off than if you kept your job and invested carefully over a lifetime because you probably won't be.</span>

                    <span>Someone wrote that they didn't understand why there were so many negative reviews.  A cursory search on the internet will reveal that this book very likely ought to be in the fiction category.
<br />
<br />Good luck to those who use this book as a guide.  For those of you who buy it, then daydream about making it big using these techniques, then rate is as good fiction.  That is how I believe it is best described.

<br />Review by www.businessideasclub.com
<br />
<br />There are two types of readers:
<br />
<br />The first type will benefit greatly from the ideas they get from this book. They are the positive minded individuals. They will read the book and they will take some action directly or indirectly. Action is the key to success. The rewards follow.
<br />
<br />The second type will read the book - and they may fail to understand what the fuss is all about. They will think the book is useless. They are the negative types. That's why they will probably remain where they are today.
<br />
<br />If you are negative minded and hate change, this book will not help you. If you are always keen on improving yourself, you'll love Rich Dad Poor Dad.
