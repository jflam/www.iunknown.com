                <span id="Label1">This is nature's most awesome sculpture, carved by the mighty Colorado River over millions of years. You'll have a bird's eye view as you explore the out-of-the-way waterfalls and monuments by air. In addition, a raft trip down the Colorado gives another perspective of the canyon's timeless beauty. Magnificent sunrises, sunsets, and the changing seasons are all here to enjoy at your leisure. </span>

                    <span>I live in the UK and ordered this movie as a prelude to visiting the grand canyon in person for the second time (since I went some years ago).<P>I have a home cinema system with a 100" projection screen. I therefore believed this DVD would look impressive. However I was a little disappointed by the picture quality but a lot more by the soundtrack which was poor quality.<P>Although the scenery is impressive on the film, there is no soundtrack apart from music. This is it's main failing, since I was hard pressed to sit through 55 minutes of scenery, mixed in with closeups of flowers, wildlife and a steam train with no narative. This could have been hugely informative, with good shots of scenery but it needed a narrator to give history, background, facts and figures, geology etc etc. As it was, I turned it off after 40 minutes because the scenery, beautiful though it was, all started to look rather similar. THe program desperately needed some facts and figures to break it up. <P>Overall I was disappointed and probably would not watch this DVD again. In any case it doesn't compare with the IMAX productions that are far superior, or to being there in person.</span>

                    <span>My wife & I have have experienced the Grand Canyon's beauty by mule and twice on overnight hiking trips and are about to embark on a 6-day white water rafting trip through the Grand Canyon. This DVD is by far the best depiction of the Canyon's beauty that I've ever seen. However, you have to experience the Grand Canyon yourself to put all this beauty seen on the DVD in perspective.</span>
