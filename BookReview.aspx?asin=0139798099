                <span id="Label1">Fully revised and beefed up with plenty of new material on today's Standard C++, the new edition of Bruce Eckel's <I>Thinking in C++: Volume I</I> is an excellent tutorial to mastering this rich (and sometimes daunting) programming language, filled with expert advice and written in a patient, knowledgeable style.<p> The effective presentation, along with dozens of helpful code examples, make this book a standout. The text first sets the stage for using C++ with a tour of what object-oriented programming is all about, as well as the software design life cycle. The author then delves into every aspect of C++, from basic keywords and programming principles to more advanced topics, like function and operator overloading, virtual inheritance, exception handling, namespaces, and templates. C++ is a complex language, and the author covers a lot of ground using today's Standard C++, but without getting bogged down in excessive detail. <p> The emphasis here is on practical programming, so there's basic advice on using header files, preprocessor directives, and namespaces to organize code effectively. Each chapter ends with exercises (usually about two dozen), and the entire text of the book is available on the accompanying CD-ROM. (So is the second volume, which tours Standard C++ classes and other advanced topics.)<p> Whether you have read the first edition of this book or not, there is much to mine from <I>Thinking in C++</I>. This new version continues to set a high standard as an approachable and thorough tutorial. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Introduction to objects, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, exception handling, analysis and design fundamentals, advantages of C++, transitioning from C, compiling and building programs, writing C++ functions, flow control, C++ operators, data types, casting, debugging tips, pointers to functions, designing reusable C++ classes, conditional compilation and header files, access specifiers, constructors and destructors, function overloading and default arguments, using <I>const</I> and <I>static</I> effectively, inlining, namespaces, references, copy constructors, operator overloading, using <I>new</I> and <I>delete</I> for dynamic objects, virtual functions, abstract classes, introduction to templates, and iterators.</span>

                    <span>This book is highly recommended.<P>I am an experienced programmer but my C++ was not current.<BR>I found this book very practical, thorough and compact. I<BR>was able to get fully current with the language in 3 days,<BR>and I now look forward to a similar timescale for the STL<BR>in Volume 2.<P>Of course a certain amount of words are necessary to explain<BR>the reasoning and concepts, but words take time to read.<BR>Bruce has managed to keep the words to a minimum. He<BR>doesn't baby-talk you through it, but he gives you the right<BR>information at the right time. This makes it easier to<BR>understand than the verbose and boring<BR>you-must-be-slow-witted-or-you-wouldn't-need-this-book<BR>approach which is so prevalent in programming literature.<P>This is such a relief, because usually books are hard to get<BR>through because of the time it takes to read through the<BR>rubbish to find the information, and also because the<BR>patronising attitude is hard to swallow, and _boring_.<BR>You get none of either in Bruce's book.<P>This doesn't make the book harder for beginners either.<BR>Every concept and language necessity is clearly and _fully_<BR>explained. Only without the distracting verbage it is _much_<BR>easier to understand for beginners _and_ experienced alike.<BR>When are the other authors going to get this? We're not<BR>stupid, we just want the information!<P>C++ isn't that hard, but there is a fair amount of detail<BR>required to operate it. Bruce runs you through that detail,<BR>in particular bringing up the internal language requirements<BR>that are relevant. For instance, almost everyone knows that<BR>the compiler will synthesize the default and copy<BR>constructor and destructor functions for you, but the<BR>assignment operator overloader is also synthesized. This is<BR>actually _crucial_ information for proper programming.<BR>Other books will either ignore it or put it in a more<BR>advanced section! You _need_ to know this stuff and Bruce<BR>tells you about it _when_ you need it.<P>Despite _all_ its other advantages, it is this point that<BR>makes this book stand out from the crowd. Bruce approaches<BR>from a very practical real world stand point. He knows what<BR>it takes to make a program work, and work safely, and he<BR>communicates that information by the shortest possible<BR>route. His humility and competence make this book shine.<BR>Most books will not stand alone as a teaching aid without<BR>some personal support such as a seminar or other<BR>face-to-face tuition. I believe this one will. Thinking in<BR>C++ Vol. 1 answers all the questions (like 'why doesn't this<BR>work?') before you ask them.<P>Learning (or revising) C++ is _not_ about how many pages the<BR>book has, how many programming examples they have on CD,<BR>whether they provide their own little IDE or a copy of the<BR>GNU C++ compiler on CD, etc. C++ is about C++ and this book<BR>is it. My apologies to the other authors, I'm sure you tried<BR>your best, but don't waste your time with them, get this<BR>one.<P>2003/11/22</span>

                    <span>Bruce Eckel, Thinking in C++ vol. I (Prentice Hall, 2000)<P><P>This is what so many other books about the process of programming C++ could have been. Eckel uses the most up-to- date C++ standards, the strictest programming techniques, and takes enough time to explain both the how and the why of the things that he's talking about in enough detail that the user, while perhaps needing to read certain sections two or three times to really get the gist of them, should have a thorough understanding of the subject by the time the reader has finished the section. This leads to a complete absence of the usual "here's what to do, don't worry about why you're doing it until we get to chapter X" found in most programming books. It also stresses programmers developing their own programming style, but imposes the strictures called for by the ANSI C++ standard. Sometimes too much freedom IS a bad thing, and that's the case with the vast majority of books on C++ programming. Individuality is important, but clarity of code is important, too.<P><P>The book has few shortcomings. The section on namespaces could be a little clearer considering a number of the prospective readers of this book are less familiar with them than they are with most of the other concepts covered here, for example. But the shortcomings are few and far between.<P><P>The most important thing about the book, though, is that Eckel uses the book's style and presentation as a physical model of abstraction, the most important move any programmer makes from a procedural language to an object-oriented language. The astute reader will pick up from Eckel's discussions of the philosophy of programming an understanding that not everything is about code, and that code is not the be-all and end-all of the programmer's job. A lot of it, especially in the design stages, is concept. Many of us in today's workforce, especially those who have spent whole careers doing nothing other than modifying existing code, forget that all too often. We're stuck in reactive environments, where the company believes that keeping things running is more important than improving them. A grounding in the design concepts presented here may allow more adept programmers to turn a reactive situation into a proactive one--being able to keep things running at the same time they're being made better. And that's how it should be. ****</span>

                    <span>I have been wanting to learn C++ for about 8 years now, but have never found any really spectacular books for getting me to where I need to be, starting from the ground up and introducing concepts in small coherent chunks. So, I just stuck with the languages I knew, and kept putting c++ to the side. Oh, and making the excuse that "java can do everything I need", not true as I'm am delving into the dsp world. Thanks to this book, I'm further than I have ever been before in understanding C++!!! The book along with the supplemental answer guide (for a small fee from bruce eckel's site www.mindview.net) have proven invaluable! Making C++ easy to understand is no easy task! It is obvious to me that bruce not only has a profound understanding of programming in multiple languages, but also a great teaching ability. It is rare to find someone who has both of these traits. This book isn't specifically geared towards java programmers by any means, but this book combined with my java experience has made learning c++ painless, not to mention interesting and enjoyable. I know there are other great c++ books out there, but if you are transitioning to c++ from another language or are a programming newbie, I would say this is the book to get. It would also make great reference. GET IT!!!</span>

                    <span>If you really want to understand C++, and have some time on your hands, then this is the book for you. Eckel presents the information in an easy to understand format, making it easy for the reader to grasp the ideas.<P>My only gripes are that he expects the user to already know C, and he uses struct instead of class throughout most of the book. Another beginning book to look at would be Accelerated C++, by Andrew Koenig.</span>

                    <span>As far as I know, this is the best book available on this subject at this time. It's been the best read I've had in quite a while (that includes fiction). It's very well written, introducing new concepts to the reader in a very smooth and natural way. If you've ever wondered why 'C++ is the next logical step', then you should read this book.<P>I have also read 'C++ inside & out' and 'Thinking in Java' from Bruce Eckel, and I must say his educational and writing skills are getting even better and better. He clearly knows what he is talking about, and, more importantly, he also knows *how* to talk about it - not always a given. My C++ was getting a bit rusty, but TICPP has got me back on the C++-track in no time, and after reading it I feel ready to take on the world - well, almost..<P>In short: buy this book and read it.<BR>Then go on and show it off to your friends..</span>
