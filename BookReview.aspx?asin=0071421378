                    <span>Next to my mefloquine tablets, this was the next-most-used resource the PC gave me. "Short" and "comprehensive" are generally mutually exclusive, but this dictionary managed to strike a good balance. If you're looking for a desk reference, there are more comprehensive dictionaries around. But if you're looking for something that doubles as a portable language reference and something to throw at black mambas, this is it.</span>

                    <span>I got this Dictionary with Teach Yourself Swahili. The both of the books are showing age, but especially the dictionary. At least the Textbook had a word for Computer(Kompyuta) in it! The dictionary has the needed words though, don't get me wrong. The word "to look" is very important.<P>Oddly, I did find a use for the dictionary in a very modern reference though. I translate some Swahili from the Simpsons myself and it added up to the translation they had on TV, so hey! I guess that is a bad example, but their are few good Swahili dictionaries and this one is pocket sized.</span>

                    <span>This is a reprint of Perrott's dictionary that was first published in 1965 but based on much much earlier lexicographical work. It is a simple glossary with mostly single equivalencies given. The Swahili-English section is adequate for simple, basic sorts of vocabulary, but it contains none of the new terminology and vocabulary that has entered the language since the original lexicographical research was done. So, for instance, it would be inadequate for reading a modern Swahili newspaper, let alone a novel or modern play. Many of my students over the years have used this book and it was a useful tool given a lack of a pocket-sized Swahili dictionary that a student could easily carry around. But students had a lot of problems using the English-Swahili section of the book. Many times the gloss given for a particular English word, is not the correct one, or does not reflect modern meanings or usage.</span>

                    <span>I was perfectly content with this Swahili dictionary as a desktop reference ... until I noticed that it doesn't include some very obvious nouns, such as cheetah (duma), ruby (yakuti), or tarantula (bui). It also neglects to mention that many of these words will only be understood by 'formal' Swahili speakers on the coast and in Nairobi. Inland speakers use a related, but less complex, form of the language.<P>Still, this works for a basic at-home reference, especially if combined with an online Swahili translation reference such as the Living Swahili Dictionary (...)</span>
