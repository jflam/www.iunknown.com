                <span id="Label1">A recent <I>Fortune</I> poll cited General Electric Company as America's most admired company. Much of the credit went to Jack Welch, GE's chief executive for the past 17 years. During his tenure, GE's revenues and profits have grown enormously. Its share price has soared, making GE the world's most valuable company. And the key to GE's success, according to <I>Jack Welch and the GE Way</I>, is Welch's fanatical devotion to a personal philosophy of leadership. Author Robert Slater has made a growth industry of his own out of Welch, penning two previous books on him, <I>The New GE</I> in 1992 and <I>Get Better or Get Beaten!</I> two years later. The same territory was plowed in 1993 by Noel M. Tichy and Stratford Sherman in <I>Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will</I>. <P>  In this book, Slater draws extensively on Welch's own words to deliver his now familiar message: keep it simple; face reality; embrace change; fight bureaucracy. Bromides these may be, but Slater's account of Welch's fierce efforts to lead a global, multifarious organization of 270,000 people does inspire admiration, even if it does not enable emulation. The book provides fresh insights into GE's shift toward service businesses, as with its takeover and transformation of NBC. Most timely are Welch's closing thoughts on trends in the global economy. <I>Jack Welch and the GE Way</I> is a must for the legions of "Welch-heads" out there and for anyone else interested in this brilliant leader's perspective on the future of business. <I>--Barry Mitzman</I> </span>

                    <span>Good overview of the Jack Welch way, including a variety of innovative business ideas that brought GE forward.<p>However, as a book goes, it would appear the author was paid by the word.  Each of the "secrets" is presented, reviewed, repeated, and presented again in a 300+ page book that would better be summarized in about 20.  I kept reading after the first two chapters thinking I would learn somthing new, but honestly, save your money, read chapter one at the library, and go home with just as much insight.<p>To the publisher, I'd recommed an "executive summary" version for the next edition.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book before reading Jack's "Straight from the Gut". When I read this book I thought it was 5 stars and I re-read this book at least once looking for clues to help my own business. Then I read Jack's book and realized his was better. In any case this covers all the basic aspects of Jack's methods including the educational meetings at the GE "university", cleaning house, picking winning companies, eliminating small market share companies, and promoting top performers and eliminating underperformers. It shows how he is hands on.<p>Good if you want to read two books on Jack Welch.<p>Jack in Toronto</span>

                    <span>I've worked as an engineer for GE under Jack Welch and I have also worked as a (civilian) naval engineer.  <p>GE's bureaucracy makes the government look like a paradigm of efficiency.  GE is probably the most politicized, bureaucratic, inefficient and bloated organization on the planet. <p>Jack Welch is incompetent.  Read a comic book instead:  You'll find more truth in one.</span>

                    <span>This book has some nuggets but you do have to overcome some meandering. The author jumps from format to format sometimes turning the book into a Jack Welch biography and at other times acting as if the book were a serious business analysis of GE and the changes Welch brought. It fails as a biography and the business analysis is lightweight at best. It's not clear what this book is trying to deliver but what I got out of it were a cursory understanding of the challenges that GE faced and some sense of why Jack Welch succeeded. Now that Jack Welch is retired and has an autobiography "Straight from the Gut" this book is almost obsolete.</span>

                    <span>Applying some of the concepts of Mr. Welch's philosophy helped to facilitate operational improvement in my team that earned a distinguished company award.  I was so enthralled that I purchased a GE fridge, and convinced my in-laws to do the same even though another brand of fridge lasted tham almost 30 years.  Less than 5 years and thousands of dollars later, neither GE fridge is operational.  The GE Way -- admire the brilliance, but stay away from the products.</span>
