                <span id="Label1"> Topics in this guide to data compression techniques include the Shannon-Fano and Huffman coding techniques, Lossy compression, the JPEG compression algorithm, and fractal compression. Readers also study adaptive Huffman coding, arithmetic coding, dictionary compression methods, and learn to write C programs for nearly any environment. The disk illustrates each learned technique and demonstrates how data compression works.</span>

                    <span>If you want to implement a compression scheme fast easily, or to have  general knowledge about compression algorithms this is a very good book. If  you really want to deeply understand compression algorithms, to have some  kind of insight about them, and to know about the best algorithms available  today - this book is has less benefit (understatement).</span>

                    <span>PROs: 1. It is one of very few books on data compression available on the market. 2. Description of the IDEAS of compression techniques is very well written. 3. The books comes with the C code for most algorithms. 4. Fairly  wide scope of data compression techniques is presented.<p>CONs: 1. Possibly  for copyright reasons, the formats of commonly used file formats are not  disclosed; the enclosed propgrams are generic compression algorithms, which  do not create (or open) actual .ZIP, .ARC, or .JPG files, which can be  opened by commercial programs. Therefore, this book will not help you to  open standard compressed files from your home-made programs. 2. There is a  missing link between the well described ideas (general principles) of the  compression techniques, and their actual algorithms presented as C programs  - namely, the algorithms are not described verbally. You have to analyze  typically 6-page-long programs to understand how the actual encoding is  done. 3. Although there is a section on sound compression, the MP3 standard  is not explained. The same applies to MPEG.<p>SUMMARY: Good to get a  general idea how the data compression is performed. Helpful if you want to  develop your own compressed data format. Of very limited help if you want  to work with standard compressed files in your own program. Requires  knowledge of C and some time to study the enclosed code.</span>

                    <span>This book's target audience is the novice C programmer who needs to implement data compression of some kind.  The authors go to great pains to explain exactly how the code works, but they don't do as good a job on the  algorithms themselves.  If you are a competent C programmer and/or have any  formal training in algorithms, this is probably not the book for you,  though it may be a good jumping-off point if it's the only book you can get  your hands on.</span>

                    <span>This book did a better job than any other of teaching me sliding window dictionary encoding and adaptive huffman encoding.  It got right to the point in an easy to understand fashon.  There was no thick cloud of theory  masking the information I needed.  Read this book before you read others on  the subject of data compression.</span>
