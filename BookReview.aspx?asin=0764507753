                <span id="Label1">Microsoft SQL Server 2000 has become standard equipment in lots of organizations, largely owing to its relatively friendly user interface on top of its solid infrastructure. That user interface, however, can intimidate users who are new to the environment and lack the experience to interpret what they see. <I>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 for Dummies</I> decodes this top-of-the-line relational database management system (RDBMS) for the benefit of such novices, as well as for people coming to SQL Server 2000 from one of its competitors. Anthony Mann does a fine job of explaining not only administrative matters, but also issues of database design, Structured Query Language (SQL), and integration of SQL Server databases into larger information systems.<p>  The instructional style in this book varies depending on the subject at hand. When explaining subjects that are mostly conceptual in nature, such as relational database structure, Mann relies mainly on text and bulleted lists (and perhaps not enough on diagrams, which can really clarify these topics). When covering areas that have more to do with the specifics of SQL Server 2000--running Data Transformation Services (DTS) imports and exports, for instance--he employs steps (with options and alternate paths explained) and screen shots of the user interface. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> How to set up and maintain databases under SQL Server 2000, with some instruction in relational database design and Structured Query Language (SQL) thrown in. Databases, tables, keys, foreign keys, basic Transact-SQL, stored procedures, triggers, and administrative subjects like backup, restoration, and distributed databases are all covered. </span>

                    <span>The only perceived value of this book could be the enclosed CD, a 120 day Evaluation version of the SQL 2K Server, Enterprise Edition, a couple thousand retail, which will need a updater to SP3a on the MS support website. This will bring the app to the latest version, since "Yukon" is currently in beta, will not be released until Late 04. You probably can get an Eval CD directly from MS for small shipping, or free at a trade show, such as Comdex, at a local MS Sales office, or SQL Server Users Group (UG). No additional files are on the CD. You can install this on Server 2K, Server 2K3, Server NT4SP6, and Win98SE; but the installation chapter is a download from the publisher's website to save book space!<p>The heart of the book, Part II DataBase (DB) Design, has 4 chapters over 112 pages for describing relational DB, creating a Customer DB, indexing, triggers, programming, and procedures. He devotes 2+ pages to Locking. Then in Part III Interface Design, he has 3 chapters covering 80 pages for describing SQL, Query, and Import/Export. Slim pickings for a budding DBA, many tables; maybe one can use this book as an abridged reference.<p>Then there's more, Part IV Enterprise Issues, Chap 11 goes over making a DB backup / restore that I agree needs to be covered. And Chap 12 covering web serving your DB is OK, but I'd hold the line on Chap 13 where he covers Distributed Queries over multiple servers, to exploit the Enterprise version capability. Like most budding DBAs are going to have multiple, remote, networked DB servers at his disposal? Nonetheless, this chapter seems to be the author's pride and joy. I'd highly recommend the author use these 12 precious pages to beef up what he has already covered.<p>But most superfilous is his Appendix A, where he expends over 18 precious pages for Wizard flowcharts. What a waste! The Security chapter is a download from the publisher's website. The author is at tmann at vbasic dot com .<p>His book's most significant failing is not showing how to display or print out a result or report of a DB query. Perhaps the author hasn't found out that reports are the life-blood of business. He gives a half page mention of the Crystal Report Writer in the last chapter (p338), but neither integrates reports in his book, nor indicates that an older v4.5 (96) version is bundled with the SQL Server 2K. SQL Server Help for reports is useless as Crystal has its own separate Help. As demoed in our local UG, MS has just released its own Reporting Services module (free download) to supplant the highly regarded Crystal Reports.</span>

                    <span>Let's just say this is not a very good dummies book.  There are very very few "real world" examples of the topics presented.  The technical accuracy is pretty decent, but this book will not enlighten any beginners to the world of SQL Server.  Advanced topics are rarely explained in layman terms and the depth of coverage is, shall we say, not very deep at all!  Stick to the SQL Server Online Books (which this book just seems to re-hash, albeit in much less detail) and you'll learn alot more about SQL Server.</span>

                    <span>Although the book covers the major features it offers little over the online help.  What is missing is the overall context or a complete example that might help understanding of how to put everything together into a working application.  When it presents triggers and stored procedures the examples are so basic as to not explore the potential power.  The chapter on relational database design was particularly lacking in ideas or references.  Some of the more powerful features such as metadata and analysis services are barely mentioned.   The book did introduce the major administrative functions well.  If you do buy the book, do go the authors web site described in the book, to get the "bonus" chapters on installation and security, which should also help a new administrator.</span>
