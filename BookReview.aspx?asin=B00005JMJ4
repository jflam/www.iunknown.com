                <span id="Label1">Like a good dream, Sofia Coppola's <I>Lost in Translation</I> envelops you with an aura of fantastic light, moody sound, head-turning love, and a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, even though you've probably never been to this neon-fused version of Tokyo. Certainly Bob Harris has not. The 50-ish actor has signed on for big money shooting whiskey ads instead of doing something good for his career or his long-distance family. Jetlagged, helplessly lost with his Japanese-speaking director, and out of sync with the metropolis, Harris (Bill Murray, never better) befriends the married but lovelorn 25-year-old Charlotte (played with heaps of poise by 18-year-old Scarlett Johansson). Even before her photographer husband all but abandons her, she is adrift like Harris but in a total entrapment of youth. How Charlotte and Bill discover they are soul mates will be cherished for years to come. Written and directed by Coppola (<I>The Virgin Suicides</I>), the film is far more atmospheric than plot-driven: we whiz through Tokyo parties, karaoke bars, and odd nightlife, always ending up in the impossibly posh hotel where the two are staying. The wisps of bittersweet loneliness of Bill and Charlotte are handled smartly and romantically, but unlike modern studio films, this isn't a May-November fling film. Surely and steadily, the film ends on a much-talked-about grace note, which may burn some, yet awards film lovers who "always had Paris" with another cinematic destination of the heart. <I>--Doug Thomas</I></span>

                    <span>If you've ever been in a hotel in a strange city, lonely and unable to sleep, you will instantly identify with Bob Harris (Bill Murray), even though Harris is a well-heeled star and you probably are not. But don't go into this film expecting the plot to follow cliches. Harris is a prisoner in a 5-star palace, dealing with a difficult wife back home, and running into nubile, much younger Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). You'd expect she and Harris and to have a sexual liaison. They do not, and the plot and script avoid a dozen other cliches. Instead, the story takes Harris and Charlotte down unexpected Tokyo alleys while the two try and sort out their lives.<P>This film is directed with an eye to a stylistic capture of the reality of modern Japan. Bolstered by impressive cinematography (especially lighting and camera angles), it keeps the viewer interested and engaged as Murray and Johansson deliver consummate performances. Indeed, this is by far Bill Murray's finest work. Instead of the over-the-top characters in everything from "Scrooged" to "Ghostbusters," we see an actor with depth of voice, emotion, and facial expression.<P>Sophia Coppola knows her subject, having spent several years in Japan. Perhaps she could have been a bit tighter with the editing, but there is little else bad to be said about this film. Of course, this isn't a film for the action-movie, dramatic-effects crowd. But if you are the sort who enjoys "slice of life," good dialogue, and a touching tale, well, order it now!</span>

                    <span>To answer the question 'Will YOU like THIS movie?' It all boils down to the fact that this is a Bill Murray movie. If you like Murray you WILL like this movie because Murray is Murray regardless of the production he is in. But be forewarned--Cadyshack this is not. Keep in mind you are watching two very bored people try to cope with their situation. If you're looking for something funny Lost in La Mancha might be a better bet.</span>

                    <span>WOW! i'm sorry, but did i miss something here? This movie was horrible. A normal movie lover, i was bored out of my mind tossing and turning staring at my wall, pausing to go to the bathroom, running downstairs for some food... even fell asleep once. what a waste of the $15.00 i paid for it. maybe im missing something but this cheepo shot in tokyo looks like it cost $200 to make, and was a pointless movie. all in favor that johnny should have won the Acadamy award instead say Aye... </span>

                    <span>Well, I don't know.. I thought it was OK! I did like the cultural clashes that the main Characters found in Japan. Thier relationship built up in a way that is pretty realistic to the way that I meet people. Very interesting to see a truly believable relationship blossom. <P>My only issue with the movie is that it kinda took a long time to develop. If I could just look at it as a story of others lives, I would be totally satisfied. For some reason I just kept looking for more. I can't determine if that is a positive or negative. I think positive because at the end of the movie I felt pretty content with the movie. I also had a pretty good feeling in my guts, which means it is a good movie to me.<P>The biggest positive is that it has one of my favorite actors of all time in it. Bill Murray! Man, He should be in more movies. I also give props to Sofia Coppola for putting out a great first movie..</span>

                    <span>The film, although not filled with exciting plot twists, is rather good. Instead of focusing on plot, the film focuses more on character development, as well as the development of a relationship. I believe that we all can relate to situations in which we become friends with someone, yet never keep in touch after this seemingly wonderful time has passed. The characters are real, and heartfelt, and although, like I said, it wasn't incredibly exciting, it does contemplate the mechanics of relationships in a way I never thought possible.</span>
