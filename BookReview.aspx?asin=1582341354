                <span id="Label1">If a place is best known by its particulars, then Edmund White is an expert on Paris. Fortunately, he's generous with his secrets: he reveals a Paris not found in any other guide in this first book in the Writer and the City series. White's Paris is seen on foot, as a fl&acirc;neur, a stroller who aimlessly loses himself in a crowd, going wherever curiosity leads him and  collecting impressions along the way. Paris is the perfect city for the fl&acirc;neur, as every <I>quartier</I> is beautiful and full of rich and surprising delights. But this is no typical tour of monuments and museums; it is much more intimate and surprising. As a fl&acirc;neur of Paris for 16 years, White knows where to find the very best of everything--silver, sheets, plum slivovitz. He can tell you where to get Tex-Mex surrounded by a dance rehearsal hall, where to rent an entire castle for a party, or even where to get Skippy peanut butter. He eschews the pearl-gray city built by Napoleon and roams the places where the real vitality lives, the teaming <I>quartiers</I> inhabited by Arabs and Asians and Africans, the strange corners, the markets where you can find absolutely anything in this city that accommodates all tastes. White's Paris is a place rich in history with a passion for novelty and distractions. So a walk through the Jewish ghetto leads to the history of the little-known Mus&eacute;e Nissim de Camondo, with its impressive collection of Louis XV and Louis XVI furniture, created by a family of Jewish bankers ultimately killed in the Holocaust. White shares other favorite and obscure museums, such as the H&ocirc;tel du Lauzun, where writers like Balzac and Charles Baudelaire and the painter Edouard Manet met for long evenings of music and hashish-induced hallucinations. Reminiscences in Montmartre reach back to the thriving jazz culture created by African Americans in the years between the world wars and include stories about Josephine Baker, Richard Wright, and James Baldwin. While White may ignore Notre Dame, he has fascinating tidbits to share about kings and queens and their heirs who still fight for the throne. The variety of Paris, White remarks, is matched by the voraciousness and passion of its people. With his own remarkable flair, he reveals a thriving and alluring city where tourists rarely tread. <I>--Lesley Reed</I> </span>

                    <span>Edmund White has done it again. He has created the first (in what seems to be a series) guided tour of a great city which focuses on the idiosyncrases, particular flavor, befuddling history and ultimate addicting charm of Paris. This is as close as it gets to walking along side an established scholar and join him in the role of "Flaneur" - one who meanders without prejudice through the backways of a great city, just for the sake of observing and reflecting. There is more French (rather Parisian) history in this little tome than multivolume sets that mold on library shelves. But we find out only the things that interest White (he makes it all so poignant). Sections of the city and the book are devoted to the peculiar Parisian take on monarchism vs royalsim vs republicanism vs socialism. White cleverly introduces anecdotes that at first suggest neighborhood gossip but later are referenced to available writing that documents these strange truths. There is an entertaining history of African Americans in Paris, immigrants of all nationalities as they are today and were in history, a hilariously confused lineage of the royalty of France, and a frightening examination of why AIDS is so rampant in the city. White strolls, cruises, pauses, reflects, delights in the smells and times of day when the light is best in certain areas, and provides a staggering list of the countless museums devoted to every idea imaginable while castigating city design choices and current architecture meant to make the city logical.<P>The format of this book is very small which means it would fit into the back pocket of any tourist visiting the City of Light who longs for much more insight than pocket guides from tour companies can even suggest. White writes as well in books like this and his bios of Genet, Proust etc as he does in his inimitable novels. This is a little treasure of a book!</span>

                    <span>Edmund White gives a very different "travel book" in FLANEUR: A STROLL THROUGH THE PARADOXES OF PARIS. If you don't delight in books that compare prices of hotels and restaurants or books in which the author traces the difficulty of restoring and furbishing a fabulous villa all while beguiling and amusing the locals then White's book will offer you a refreshing alternative. <P>Sixteen-year resident, White, offers a view of Paris that is at once personal and historical. It is more accurately described as a memoir of Paris rather than a standard travel book. One feels as though a friend is offering a leisurely tour of the city showing you his favorite places and telling stories offering insight and historical tidbits not dragging you through a checklist as an impersonal tourist. The changes in neighborhoods and the histories he describes particularly those of expatriate Americans in Paris are all insightful. White's tone is erudite and conversational without being tedious or condescending. The term flaneur is key in the title. The pace of the book is strolling but always interesting. It seems to have no direction but the end result is both illuminating and satisfying. Most remarkably it offers an enjoyable read whether one is immediately traveling to Paris or armchair traveling or whether one is living in a villa in Europe or a small apartment in the States.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a meandering discussion of both the ideal of Paris and its geography. White has lived for over 15 years in Paris, and he provides an introduction of sorts to the city for Americans with an intellectual bent. The book can't really serve as a guide book or book with city walks, since there are no directions or street names, and certainly no itineraries. As White explains, a flaneur is someone who just wanders around, allowing himself to be drawn in the direction of anything of interest. Thus, White strolls with us through several Paris districts, commenting at length on artists or authors who lived there. Along the way, we find entire chapters on African Americans in Paris, gays in Paris, and Jews in Paris. The book assumes a certain familiarity with both the city itself and Parisian people. If you're a complete newcomer, you may find parts of the book somewhat confusing. But if you're an American who has spent at least several weeks in the city, you may find this book to be a delightful diversion.</span>

                    <span>I read The Flaneur as part of a research for my undergraduate dissertation (tourism). It offers an alternative view to the rosy pictures many travel guides have painted of Paris. Although one has to infer and read between the lines in this book for academic purposes, it remains a relatively good source of leisure reading as well.</span>

                    <span>There is a lot of information packed into the 211 small (4"x7") pages of the first volume in Bloomsbury's series "The Writer and the City." The book feels (to this reader) like something done on assignment, like being back working for Time-Life books, as White was before publishing his first novel. That is, it seems more dutiful than inspired. . . and painfully politically correct. Or, is it, perhaps, painfully American to focus on minorities? <P>White accedes that the Left Bank avant-garde is a fading memory.<BR>What is vibrant is the Arab (North African) and West African slums, away from the historic center. White asserts that "the only way France can continue to function as a beacon of civilization, as anything more than a custodian of its great heritage, is by embracing the international, hybridized culture that is already thriving within the city limits" (albeit at the far reaches of those limits). White says this, but he appears to know very little about the Arabo-French or Afro-French hybrids. <P>Similarly, the chapter on Jews in Paris has a lengthy exposition of the Dreyfus Affair, but nothing about contemporary Parisian Jewish culture. <P>Insofar as there is a primary thesis in the book, it is that French universalism accepts individuals but not groups. Both Jews and African Americans overestimated their assimilation, and generations of smug French people have congratulated themselves on an illusory--or at least misleading--absence of prejudice in particularly invidious contrast to American racism. White does not note the extent to which modern nationalism arose in places overrun by Napoleon's armies (and later colonial conquests) protesting French claims to be dispensing freedom by abrogating local customs and forcing Enlightenment teachings on priest (etc.)-ridden, backward inferiors.<P>"The paradox of the French spirit, which is boldly outspoken about individual experience but against all comunitarianism based on that experience, is best reflected in its literature," White writes. And his book is primarily about writers. In addition to Parisian Jews and African Americans White discourses at some length about Baudelaire and Colette, documentary photographer Eugene Atget and about (or, rather, against) the painter Gustave Moreau, about the two main brands of royalists, and more briefly about Oscar Wilde after his release from English prison. The book concludes with a sixteen page tour of literature about Paris that is useful, but less personal than the similar romp through the Proust literature at the end of White's tighter and more illuminating short biography of Marcel Proust.<P>Although I am manifestly less than enthralled with the book I want to reiterate that there is a lot of interesting information and discerning interpretation in it. It strikes me as rather soul-less, but still a text that is not without its pleasures.</span>
