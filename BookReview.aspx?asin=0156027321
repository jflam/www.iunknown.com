                <span id="Label1"><div>The son of a zookeeper, Pi Patel has an encyclopedic knowledge of animal behavior and a fervent love of stories. When Pi is sixteen, his family emigrates from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship, along with their zoo animals bound for new homes. <br>	<br>The ship sinks. Pi finds himself alone in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a 450-pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with Richard Parker for 227 days while lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again. The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story and press him to tell them "the truth." After hours of coercion, Pi tells a second story, a story much less fantastical, much more conventional--but is it more true?<br></div></span>

                    <span>C.S. Lewis meets Dean Koontz. Our 16 year old hero is the son on an Indian zoo owner and is intent on his search for enlightenment. When the father decides to sell the animals and move his family to Canada the story is set in motion. The Japanese cargo ship upon which they travel sinks! Young Pi spends the better part of a year aboard a lifeboat, sharing his meger proisions with a hyena, an orantang and a Bengal tiger to name a few of his boatmates. His life is emeshed in pure horror as we follow his day to day activities of avoiding the sharks that surround him and the wild animals that share his small space. The constant quest for water and food to feed himself and keep the tiger at bay add to the daily misery he must endure. We have storms at sea and an enchanted island to wrap ourselves around while we turn the pages of this captivating book. One cannot give away an ending but it's fair to say that the book is not over until the reader closes the cover and and dashes to the kitchen to float a piece of fruit in the sink.</span>

                    <span>The Life of Pi is captivating from beginning to end, and makes an extroidonary airplane flight, bedtime, or long car trip read. <P>It begins with the somewhat unorthodox religious practices and schoolyard rememberences of a young boy named Piscine (later shortened to Pi, for obvious reasons). During this part of the book, a concerning quality can be observed about Martel's writing... That, though religion is interesting sometimes, it must be sustained throughout to have any meaning. Pi finds good parts about many religions, and practices them all to an extent. However, the connotations about these religious practices fall off dramatically when the main plot arises. I wonder if these notions may have been better to leave out.<P>But, writing styles aside, not since Mutiny on the Bounty have I read such a good sea adventure. When the ship Pi is riding on from India sinks, a managerie of animals and he cling to a lifeboat for safety. A brutal epic of survival follows, pitting man against tiger, man against the sea, and tiger against everything else. Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger that so happens to fall into Pi's lifeboat, becomes an integral part of the story for many reasons. Well, he would have to be, in such close quarters with a scrawny Indian boy, on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific. The middle of this book, the tale of Pi and Richard Parker's sea hardships and adventures, is the most captivating writing I've seen in a while. Keep an eye out for the part when Pi reaches the island of algea... wacky!<P>The conclusion is a little concerning. Martel brings back the religious references a tad, but the audience is torn between two different accounts of the happenings of Pi and his Tiger. However, in true sea adventure fashion, the audience is ultimately left with a sense of happy completion. Go get this book and read it, it's well worth it!</span>

                    <span>Life of Pi was a wonderful book, with notes of philosophy and theological thought tied into a well crafted story. While it may start with a slightly slower pace than other books in the genre, it is worth the effort. If you liked this, I would also recommend Golf in the Kingdom.</span>

                    <span>journey across blue seas with one of the most unforgetable characters I have ever come across. Pi Patel, a zookeepers son living in India,has a vast knowledge of animals and is in a love/fear relationship with them all. When the family must move, they do so, zoo and all to Canada. Unfortuneately the ship they are on loses its battle with the sea and sinks; leaving Pi on a lifeboat with several of the surviving zoo animals.<P>This floating island becomes a city within itself and how Pi survives, fighting to co-exist with the wild beasts while defending himself against hunger, thirst and nature is a frightening yet mystical journey for both Pi and the reader. <P>The fact that Pi is a Catholic/Hindu/Muslim adds something very thought-provoking to an already magnetic novel.<P>I suggest you travel along with this enigmatic boy/man and see through his eyes the vast expanse of sea; hear through his ears the wild frightening animal noises; pray with him to his God and above all take this author's flight of imagination and savor and enjoy because it is truly wonderful!</span>

                    <span>Martel spins a fascinating yarn that goes beyond the realm of imagination. The exposition moves slowly, leaving the reader to ponder where the tale is headed. However, once the plot becomes apparent, the text flows, for the most part. The seemingly simple story line of being trapped on a lifeboat is, indeed, complex. Some readers tout their religious denotation; however, no one needs to look that deeply. Read it because it's an enlightening tale that makes one wonder how anyone would endure such a crisis.</span>
