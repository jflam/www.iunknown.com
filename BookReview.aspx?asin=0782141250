                    <span>I think the author has tried a little too hard to be different. I like the idea, but the book is quite meaningless. <p>I didn't think much of the author's websites. She writes a lot about design concepts & principles, but to me most of her flash projects don't look or feel very professional. She hardly utilises the potential of Flash MX and there's hardly any use of vector graphics. On top of all that, there's a lot of silly poems throughout her projects.<p>Don't waste time on this.</span>

                    <span>Seol Euna's book looks lovely on your desk. It has beautiful graphics and a lovely design. It is essentially useless if you want to learn anything about Flash MX. The directions range from extremely detailed to extremely vague. The quality of the writing suggests that the editor is new to the English language. Non standard language is used throughout. There is no index to find anything. From her web sites it is clear that Ms Euna is a successful designer. She is not a successful author.</span>

                    <span>This book disapointed me.  It is very nicely laid out.  However, if you want a book on using Flash, this is not the book to get.  The author uses Adobe, Sound Forge, and other programs in her discussion which is useless unless you have these programs.  Bottom line, not very useful.  For those experienced Flash users who want something on their coffee table to brag about, this may be the book.  For the rest of us, we are looking for substance over beauty.</span>
