                <span id="Label1">Getting away from it all is as much a part of modern life as late nights at the office and rush-hour traffic. We can all use an escape to exotic destinations, but free time is scarce and the choice of where to go is more important than ever. Paradise is the aim--perfect weather, great food, and breathtaking surroundings--and Hip Hotels: Escape features an extraordinary collection of Highly Individual Places in idyllic locations around the globe. Mexico, Morocco, India, South Africa, Tahiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Colombia, Chile, Bali, Portugal, Spain, the Australian outback--Hip Hotels: Escape covers the full range of potential escape experiences. From the Renaissance beauty of J. P. Getty's villa on the shores of Italy to a handful of luxurious tents on a remote jungle island in the China Sea, from the unique mud-hut architecture of the Mandawa Desert Camp in Rajasthan to the lush surroundings of the famous Marrakesh palm grove, escape hotels combine the impact of extraordinary geography with architectural ingenuity. Simple yet sophisticated, rugged yet refined, these hotels cater to both our instinct for escape and our city-bred taste for comfort and luxury. Like the hotels featured in Hip Hotels: City, some of the most famous names in contemporary architecture, design, decoration, and gastronomy have had a hand in creating these seductive retreats. From Jean Nouvel's design of the Htel St. James outside Bordeaux to Renzo Mongiardino's classic renovation of a thirteenth-century monastery near Siena, from Ralph Lauren's styling of Nelson Rockefeller's former lakeside lodge in the Adirondacks to French superchef Alain Ducasse's conversion of a Provenal farmhouse, these hotels offer paradise exactly the way we want it: perfect.</span>

                    <span>I got this book as present from the owner of one the resorts featured by Ypma. Its true that a picture can paint a thousand word. This book is a beautiful compilation of some of the most breathtaking locations in the world. Some of the visuals also provide interior-decorating ideas. After all, the writer is founder of the award-winning Interior Architecture and creator of the best-selling World Design series. If I'm an owner of a resort, I'd want him to feature my property the way he does it here. The places featured may offer 'out-of-this -world luxury' but ONLY if one can afford it. If paradise is the aim in every respect, there are many more beautiful and 'Highly Individual Places' that are more accessible. I would not recommend this book as the ultimate vacation guide, only the perfect coffee-table item.</span>

                    <span>The book is basically a gathering of exotic hotel panflets that are pasted in a book that delivers few pictures and fewer information on the hotels. All the places in the book are great but it leaves you longing for much more info and even more pictures..not very helpful trip planner. PS- It looks like someone had a great free vacation all around the world and all he got was this stupid book.....sorry but its true!</span>

                    <span>hip hotels city is way better (although a new version of all the new hotels would be greatly appreciated). this version, i was expecting, was to be great spa-type places to go and get pampered. instead, it seemed that most were "rundown is charming." i may use two of the places in the book, but other than that, it was just a good read on the subway home. herbert would do us all happy if he'd do another cities version, complete with all the way hip new places opening up all over the world.</span>
