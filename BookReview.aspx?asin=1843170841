                <span id="Label1">When Andrew Morton's world-famous biography, Diana: Her True Story (ISBN: 1-85479-384-5), was first published, it caused a media frenzy, severely jolted the royal family and the Palace hierarchy, and shook the British Establishment to its foundations. Later revealed as having been written with the Princess's full cooperation, this world bestseller is now seen as the nearest thing to her official biography. Yet it was not the full story, nor could it have been, given the circumstances at the time. This is even more apparent in the light of events that have occurred since her death and which have been played out under the harsh gaze of the media, once again catapulting Diana's name back into the spotlight. Figures such as her sometime lover James Hewitt, her butler, Paul Burrell - whose aborted trial for theft of the Princess's property in 2002 was followed by publication of his own kiss-and-tell memoir, causing a sensation in the fall of 2003 - and Prince Charles's valet Michael Fawcett have emerged. In addition, intriguing comments that Diana made to Morton in taped conversations, and which have never been published, become supremely important in the light of subsequent events. Friends, advisors and colleagues, interviewed now, six years after her death, feel a far greater freedom in speaking of her than they once did. In what is bound to be seen as the most definitive study of the Princess in the most crucial period of her short life, Andrew Morton - the biographer she herself chose - provides the last word on one of the most admired, influential and best-loved figures of our era. At long last, Diana: In Pursuit Of Love makes sense of the tragic Princess's life as she changed from downtrodden wife and reluctant royal into a self-confident and independent modern woman, an icon of the twenty-first century and, indeed, a 'queen in people's hearts'.</span>

                    <span>Morton has nothing new in this book.. He mentions his first book about Diana about 10,000 times during the read. It is the same old, same old. If you have read the butler's book and all the other books writen about this woman over the years what could anyone write that would be earth shaking new?<P>I think he must need money. Why else would he write such a lame book!</span>

                    <span>I have to say I was always in love with Diana, and followed her career and life very closely. I collected every magazine cover I could find during her courtship with Charles. I even got to see them once in person, from a distance of course.<P>I bought Andrew Morton's first book on Diana when it first came out, just like I got this one. This is actually the fourth book on Diana Morton has done. This book continues some of the same information. Morton has included new material here, particularly since the last book was completed some time before Diana's tragic death in Paris. <P>There aren't any earth shattering revelations here. There are different nuances, and people are naturally a little more free to say what they feel than they did while the Princess was still alive and had a future to consider, both for herself and for her boys. There are some rehashes of the allegations with Michael Fawcett, a few taped conversations that have been included that were considered too sensitive before, but by and large, this is another in a long line of books meant to continue the legacy of Diana as the woman wronged more than she was in the wrong, though there were faults on both sides.<P>Morton is obviously sympathetic with Diana, and for those of us who still can't get enough of her, this book is a treat. For those who only need a little information, this is still an intriguing book. There were mysteries in Diana's life just as there is a mystery in her death, and Morton writes this in a suspenseful way, because even though we know the fate of Diana as a person, her image lives on and will continue to develop and be surrounded by mysteries, not just the fuzzy details of her death.</span>
