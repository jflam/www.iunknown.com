                    <span>Having just return from a baseball road trip myself, visiting the new San Diego Petco Stadium, Oakland, Anahiem and BOB in Phoenix, I discovered that this book got a lot of merit in what it have to say. In almost all cases, I discovered that the authors have done their homework and their accessments of what is a good seat or bad turned out to be true. Although their reviews on food remains subjective, I discovered that what they say about it also got a lot of truth behind it. Oakland do have one of the best hot dogs and many dogs wrapped in up in these tin foils really do not tasted all that good. (Is that why we often overdose these hot dogs with massive amount flavoring?)
<br />
<br />I have been to many other stadiums of the Major League and after reading the book, I discovered that what the authors' have to say would be a great guide to anyone else who may be looking to do such a vacation. Although the season is dying out this year, there is always next year and years on end.
<br />
<br />When I go on such road trips, I usually do buy my tickets ahead of time and usually try to get the best seats money can buy. The authors' book seem to be written for people who do this on the fly or on the budget. There is nothing wrong with that but they should know that not everyone do it like they do. 
<br />
<br />The book come highly recommended by someone like me who likes to take a baseball road trips and have done so in the past. Its useful in planning such a trip, buying the tickets and eating out at these stadium. Great book which have been long over due.</span>

                    <span>This book covers it all.  From team and ballpark history to where to sit and what to eat.  The authors do a great job in detailing the ins-and-outs of every ballpark.  This is not your dry, boring reference book.  It's an easy read with a lot of humor that any baseball fan will enjoy.</span>

                    <span>The back cover of this book says that it's a "comprehensive guide to all the diverse and fascinating major league baseball ballparks throughout the country." And it is. But more than that, it's an tribute to the entire baseball experience from a tailgate barbecue, to commentaries on players salaries, to what area of the ballpark to sit, along with a very amusing skill with words.<p>Clearly a labor of love, these two guys seem to have found a way to make a living (well maybe earn at least a little) out of an obsession. The resulting book, all 530 pages is clearly the work of people loving everything about the game, and it shows.</span>

                    <span>As an avid reader of baseball books, I am often skeptical of new baseball publications.  Baseball books can be tediously academic (it is a game after all, Mr. Will) or, in the case of guide books, short on substance.  Other works just seem to repeat the stories and cliches I hear every year during rain delays.  When I saw "The Ultimate Baseball Road-Trip," I thought it might be another coffee-table book.  But it has been a fun, informative read.  The book appeals to the historian in me, especially in its efforts to tell about the Negro League and minor league entries in each respective MLB city and in its attempts to document old stadiums.  Yet, O'Connell and Pahigian write in a style that is witty and engaging, and wise to the role of trivia in the seamhead's life .  I have found myself continually sneaking a quick read at my desk or on the train. (The book is addictive and perfect for summer reading.)  Finally, I can recommend this book as a travel guide nearly on par with the "Let's Go" or "Rough Guide" series.  I used it on a trip to the Midwest and found it especially useful in less celebrated cities like Milwaukee and St. Louis.  It is rare that a book of this type can succeed on so many levels.</span>

                    <span>The Ultimate Baseball Road Trip - that's for sure!<p>Well, I must say this is a book definitely worth reading.  The authors lived a dream that many baseball fans could only imagine.  Their humorous writing coupled with obvious enthusiasm for baseball and its parks is infectious.  I found the book very useful/informative and it would be a necessary companion for future trips to major league cities.  Nine parks have already been crossed off my list so I have my work cut out but after reading this book I have the motivation to make it to some of the other stadiums and cities around major league baseball.   I'd say the authors went 3-4 with 2 doubles, 3 RBI's and a game winning hit!</span>
