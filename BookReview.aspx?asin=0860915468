                    <span>In Imagined Communities, Anderson gives a detailed analysis of nation building projects and their relationship to print media. Nationalism has been a difficult concept to define. Some like King Faisal's right hand man, Sati Al-Husri, defined nationalism by language. In contrast, Anderson defines nationalism as a construction created in imagination by print media. "It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members," Anderson explains. Moreover, "It is imagined as a community, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately, it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings."<BR>	Anderson looks at the early communities, which he says were mostly constructed around religious ideologies and were linked by the publication of books on those religious concepts. These original "communities" did not necessarily confine themselves to a given geo-political unit. However, newspapers made it possible for people in a geographically vast region to discuss the same topic at the local coffee shop, coffer or workshop. This, says Anderson, had a powerful impact on the creation of an imagined community, called a nation. Anderson then begins to look at conglomerate pioneers as a contrast to nation-state building projects. In this area, he discusses market-zones, similar to, but preceding organizations like the European Union. Who would die for such a construction? asks Anderson. He makes a distinction between this kind of imagined community and the imagined community of the nation-state. <BR>	Anderson's historical examination of the construction of nationalism seems to have merits. However, he leaves open the idea that it is an ongoing and dynamic process. This text lays the foundation for future examinations of "imagined communities" in new forms. Media appears to be a critical social component in Anderson's argument. If that is the case, there is another question that follows. What happens when the forms of media change? What happens when media, that was, at one time, limited to a geographical location becomes global? What happens when media forms that were at one time, linguistically limited, expand to bilingual or possibly even multilingual components? Anderson's book provides a great framework from which to do future scholarship.</span>

                    <span>Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities is one of the most important and influential books on the phenomenon of nationalism currently in print. The primary contribution he makes concerns the notion of the development of a community with shared or common cultural media that generate a sense of communal self-awareness or consciousness. Although he uses as his primary example the experience of reading a newspaper (which makes readers conscious of others who share their values, concerns, and experiences, even if they have no direct contact with those people, often over a great distance), the imagined community has broader implications. <P>This book will make you think about how you conceive of the communities you belong to, and how these communities are created and reproduced. Beyond the obvious importance of broadcast media, in modern American culture, the mall, with its ubiquitous chain stores, is an important motor of our imagined American community: you will find the same basic stores, carrying the same basic styles, in every town in America, creating a sense of common tastes and culture. <P>While some may complain that the book is dry and boring, it is a scholarly work intended for an educated audience. It is not a popularization intended for the general public. Nevertheless, if you are up for it, it is more than worthwhile.</span>

                    <span>Benedict Anderson's *Imagined Communities*, perhaps the most important work of political science published in the last 20 years, brings historical good sense and a panoply of meticulously organized facts to bear on the central problem of 20th-century history: namely, the growth and spread of nationalist sentiments in places that did not previously permit such for *several* reasons. Anderson's analysis "undoes" several commonplaces about the nation-state, chief among them that the concept originated in Europe: he locates the critical "fusion" of people and state as occurring with the anti-colonial movement around Simon Bolivar in 19th century Latin America, rather than the earlier movement for independence of the British colonies which formed the United States. <P>However, to Anderson's mind the character of one of the modern world's more curious institutions is not entirely without import for understanding nationalist movements, as they almost without exception employ concepts of territorial and cultural integrity which did not exist prior to colonial regimentation: the scope and extent of today's India has more to do with the British Raj than the Moghuls. But perhaps this displacement is in truth somewhat not to the taste of contemporary "interrogators" of the intersection to truth and power, and the art of Anderson's book consists in his leaving the question of national unity unsolved. To my mind one of the most telling instances of democratic sentiment on hand, and a book whose way with you is so short on account of its often-tortured verbiage: gems such as this have other uses, and I can imagine almost no use for this book.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the modern classics on nationalism, and should be required reading for anyone interested in politics, culture (since issues of nationalism permeates absolutely everything).<P>As important as this book is, don't expect a fun read. It is very badly written and can be tedious to read. More and more, I am convinced that many academics, especially those that have been touched in anyway by continental thought, are not merely not taught to write well, but are actually taught to write badly. Schopenhauer was perhaps the first to see what was going wrong. Although he considered himself a Kantian, he felt that Kant had had a horrible impact on philosophical writing. He recommended taking David Hume, who was a very clear writer, as the model instead of Kant. Unfortunately, too many German and French writers seem dedicated to immulating Kant rather than Hume, and write impenetrably as a result.</span>

                    <span>Here is a review of the book that I wrote for my history-writing class.<P>	Benedict Anderson, a professor of International Studies at Cornell University, uses his knowledge and experience to construct Imagined Communities, a non-fictional work about the origins and outcomes of nationalism. The subject matter is often complicated but rather interesting to the uneducated mind.<BR>	It is clear that Anderson's intent was to educate and enlighten those who are not familiar with the concept of nationalism or the very sub-themes connected with it (i.e. religion, patriotism), however, it appears that Anderson seems to be writing for the audience of college students with the purpose of using his book as text rather than creating the book for the average person, since he is a man of academics. <BR>	Origins and the outcomes of nationalism are the two main, distinct themes of Imagined Communities. Anderson explains that the United States is not the only one to be known for its nationalistic and patriotic nature. Many people, not just in North America, but in Europe and Asia, have a profound sense of patriotism and love toward their country of origin. Motivated by religion, patriotism, or loyalty, people from around the world either rise up against the government or crush those who oppose the status quo. <BR>	Imagined Communities is a detailed sketch of the outcomes of extreme nationalism. Cases of people being imprisoned or wiped out due to imperialistic mindsets and goals are described in explicit detail. Anderson points out that America and Britain are not the only nations to practice the Manifest Destiny ideals. Countries like China, Japan, and Russia are not immune to those ideals as they decide to push further and further into westward expansion. <BR>	The subject matter of the book accurately defines its title, Imagined Communities. Each country imagines itself to be perfect in ideals, government, society, and religion and the country's inhabitants strive to meet those idealistic goals. Some countries have lived up to their imagined standards and some have not done so. The United States was successful in expanding westward and "converting" the Native Americans to Christianity. Russia was successful in its monarchial form of government until the revolution of 1905 after the massacre known as Bloody Sunday. <BR>	Anderson's sources appear outdated to those reading this text today, since his sources have been dated as far back as the mid-19th century (the first edition of Anderson's book was published in 1983). The oldest sources are the primary sources, consisting of letters and manuscripts written by the history-makers themselves. Nonetheless, the sources are valid in accordance with the people who wrote them and their viewpoints on the occurrences.<BR>	The viewpoints used to construct this text include writers, poets, social reformers, religious leaders, and anyone from any walk of life imaginable. These viewpoints provide accurate and vital accounts of those involved with or the victims of extreme nationalism and imperialism. Anderson's academic experience and knowledge contributes greatly to this novel along with his numerous sources. He gives each case a realistic touch and tries not to let his personal opinions interfere with the hardcore evidence used to prove each case.<BR>	The shortcomings of Imagined Communities are few and far between but they must not go unmentioned. Although the intent of the text was to educate the unenlightened and uneducated reader about nationalism and its good and bad points, it appears to take on the shape of a college textbook, educating those who are studying the field of history, social sciences, or international studies. It is quite complicated and hard to understand, even to the eye of a semi-educated college student. As mentioned earlier, Anderson seems to try to not let his biased opinion interfere with the historical evidence, but it is definitely clear. He appears to be preaching his biased opinion on everything from religion to patriotism instead of sticking to the facts. The text's strength is that it drives the point home, the point that every country all over the earth we live on, strives to and imagines itself to be perfect and heavenly. The title itself is very appropriately fitting for the text.<BR>	Anderson's Imagined Communities is a mediocre work with good intentions. Unfortunately, those good intentions fall short of their standard of enlightening the reader about nationalism due to the fact that Anderson's style reads like a textbook and it is very complicated, however, his point at the end of every chapter summarizes his thesis very briefly, which makes it easier for the reader to understand and comprehend Anderson's academic writing style. The historical worth of the text is astounding. Anderson's sources provide great insight into the minds of people from the past though his liberal bias appears to be preachy in almost every chapter of his book. It's a great book, but it is more suited for the college student rather than the average, uneducated person.</span>
