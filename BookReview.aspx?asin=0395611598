                    <span>This book presents an account of the Donner Party, a wagon train of about eighty-seven people who in July 1846 started off for California via a new, untried route through the Sierras. Unfortunately, this particular wagon train of pioneers would go down in history due to the horror and tragedy that it was to meet along its way. Stranded in the Sierras amidst its harshest winter in years, with unparalleled snowfall and frigid temperatures, only little more than half, mostly women and children, were to survive their unbelievable deprivation and suffering. 
<br />
<br />This wagon train was a loose confederation of strangers who originally were part of another wagon train, but who collectively branched off by consensus to try a new, though untried and unproven, overland route through the Sierras that was alleged to be shorter. Their decision to take this new route was one that would haunt them for the rest of their journey, as it was not what it was purported to be. The inexperience of these travelers, the poor decisions that were sometimes made, and their seeming inability to truly unify as one entity contributed to their ultimate debacle. They were, after all, representative of humanity at large. Some of them were good, brave, and unselfish. Some were people with whom one would not wish to shake hands. 
<br />
<br />Beleaguered by thirst as they trekked across a desert, marauded by Indians along the way, plagued by the loss of necessary oxen and cattle, beset by accidents and personal squabbles that would sometimes turn deadly, they would finally reach the Sierras and begin their perilous crossing, only to find themselves snowbound at the summit while within sight of the pass that they needed to cross to be home free. Trapped by the weather in early November, they would set up a make-shift camp, never thinking about just how long their encampment would last. With minimal food supplies at their disposal, these intrepid, westward-ho emigrants would find themselves trapped for months, facing incredible hardships that would tax them beyond human endurance. Some would resort to cannibalism in order to survive. 
<br />
<br />This is a riveting story about survival of the fittest, about personal sacrifice, and human foibles. It is a story not only of those ill-fated pioneers but of those who would attempt to rescue them, often at great personal cost. It is a story that reflects the human spirit, both good and bad, in time of crisis. It is a story of often selfless heroism. It is also a story of greed and craven opportunism. While some of the book is politically incorrect, it is reflective of the times in which these pioneers lived, as well as that of when this book was first written. 
<br />
<br />It is, however, remiss that the maps included in this book do little to illustrate the deadly journey undertaken by these pioneers. Still, the lack of comprehensive maps does not unduly detract from the powerful impact that this story has on the reader. Moreover, although the book was published in 1936, the author, a trained historian, added a supplement in 1960, which is included in this edition of his book. This supplement serves to correct errors, as well as incorporate additional relevant material not available at the time of original publication. 
<br />
<br />Those who enjoy tales of survival will, undoubtedly, find this gripping tale well worth reading.

                    <span>Yes, the maps are next to useless.  Yes, Stewart probably has some facts skewed.  Yes, he had his biases.<p>BUT, this book WILL leave you paralyzed with horror and wonder.  The Donner Party saga may be one of the greatest "If Only..." stories of all time.  <p>For updated details of the story, see Kristin Johnson's superb web site.  <p>But for sheer electrifying narrative, this is the place to start!!!<p>(Frankly, I can't even imagine giving this book less than four stars.  One star???  Hello???)</span>

                    <span>George R. Stewarts" "Ordeal By Hunger" is the ultimate work based upon the ill-fated Donner Party expedition - one of the most horrifying events in American history. Originally published in the 1930s, Stewart's book has been the final word on this tale for multiple generations. Oddly enough, to date it is the most comprehensive study on this story, stocked with excellent detail and insight.<p>It is almost impossible to imagine the suffering these 80-plus pioneers were forced to endure. After reading "Ordeal By Hunger," one will be much less likely to take their own lives for granted. And that is what the heart is of this story and Stewart's novel.<p>The year is 1846, and the great pioneer migration west has begun. A group of families, inspired by a recent book by Lansford Hastings promoting a shortcut to California, decide to pack up their belongings and go west. They take the shortcut, though Hastings, who promised to lead them through, is nowhere to be found. They become lost, cutting a trail through the Wasatch Mountains, which to this day is a major highway in Salt Lake City. They cross the great Salt Lake desert, losing wagons and oxen, and eventually find themselves desolate in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with little food, inadequate shelter and trapped by the worst snowstorm in recorded history. Eventually people begin to die. In order to survive, many resort to cannibalism. After four relief efforts, about half of the party finally makes it to California. In all, over 40 perished.<p>To this day, the Donner Party expedition is studied by sociologists and doctors alike. The group slowly fell into an "Every Man for Himself" dynamic, with the elderly and the infants perishing first. Then single men without families died. Ironically, most of the women and children survived, though explanations for this, touched upon in Stewart's work, have varied from the fat content in female bodies to the family dynamic remaining barely entact, thus aiding in survival. <p>Multiple murders took place during this expedition, including the slaying of two Native American volunteers who were eventually consumed for nourishment. "Ordeal By Hunger" details such unimaginable horror, examining a group of tragically unfortunate people who were forced to rely on their most basic instincts. The reasons for such circumstance, touched upon in Stewart's novel, included bad luck, bad decision and poor leadership.<p>Such tales of basic instinct/survival exist in the anals of world history, but there are very few - if any - that have actually taken place on American soil. The Donner Party expedition is the dark tale whispered to us by our parents. It is a story wrought with great heroism and heartbreaking tragedy. It is an epic of despair that serves as an example of how crucial the family dynamic is towards survival in any society. After reading "Ordeal By Hunger," one will ask themselves, "What would I have done in the same situation?"<p>Today, "Ordeal By Hunger" is rather dated if only because there are no visuals. The maps are poorly detailed. An excellent companion book is Frank Mullen's recent "The Donner Party Chronicles," which includes photographs and color maps of the actual locations where these horrors and struggles took place. But for those yet unaware of this historical footnote, "Ordeal By Hunger" should be the first step towards understanding the dark side of the human experience. Thus, there is wisdom to be found in these pages.</span>

                    <span>...This is a thoroughly researched and incredibly well narrated account of The Donner Party. Perhaps considered still the definitive work on the topic, despite having been written in the early 1930's with various updates since, this book is an incredible "can't put down" read start to finish for armchair historians and professional historians alike.</span>

                    <span>Poignant, evocative, unsettling, Ordeal By Hunger is epic Americana. Written 80 years after the Donner tragedy and 70 years before our own time, it is an historical document that reveals much about developing American values and social mores over the past century and a half.</span>
