                    <span>Great book.  Covers all you need from actually installing the floor to the final coat of finish.  I'm a first timer, but installed and finished my pine floors and saved about $7000.<p>I'm now planning to install ceramic tile for first time and hope to find book on this subject as good as Don Bollinger's book.<p>Robert</span>

                    <span>If you're planning to install or refinish wood floors, you really should read this book. Installing wood flooring is definitely something a determined beginner can do, but there are some pitfalls along the way. This book will help you avoid them. There's also a companion video that I highly recommend. The time and expense of buying and reading/watching these materials will be returned many times over by avoiding mistakes.<p>I used the book and video to help prepare myself for my first DIY floor installation, and everything went extremely well. I also had some coaching from a local installer, which I highly recommend. He had me practice on an 8' x 8' square before doing anything on the actual floor. The more you can learn, the easier it will all be and the better the final results. In my case, the results were really quite astonishing - I had many, many comments and compliments, and more than one person mentioned that my work was better than the "professional" work in their own house. That's an advantage of doing it yourself - you can take the time to do it right.</span>
