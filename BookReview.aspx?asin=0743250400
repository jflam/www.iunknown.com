                <span id="Label1"><P> Like Michael Cunningham in <I>The Hours,</I> Colm T&#243;ib&#237;n captures the extraordinary mind and heart of a great writer. Brilliant and profoundly moving, <I>The Master</I> tells the story of Henry James, a man born into one of America's first intellectual families two decades before the Civil War. James left his country to live in Paris, Rome, Venice, and London among privileged artists and writers. <P> In stunningly resonant prose, T&#243;ib&#237;n captures the loneliness and longing, the hope and despair of a man who never married, never resolved his sexual identity, and whose forays into intimacy inevitably failed him and those he tried to love. The emotional intensity of T&#243;ib&#237;n's portrait of James is riveting. Time and again, James, a master of psychological subtlety in his fiction, proves blind to his own heart and incapable of reconciling his dreams of passion with his own fragility. <P> T&#243;ib&#237;n is "a great and humanizing writer" who describes complex relationships in "supple, beautifully modulated prose" (<I>The Washington Post Book World</I>). In <I>The Master,</I> he has written his most ambitious and heartbreaking novel, an extraordinarily inventive encounter with a character at the cusp of the modern age, elusive to his own friends and even family, yet astonishingly vivid in these pages.</span>

                    <span>I bought and read this novel, not so much because it's about Henry James as that is is written by Colm Toibin, one of my favorite contemporary writers. I am certainly no authority on Mr. James, having read only two of his novels-- many years ago-- both required in an English course, THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY and THE TURN OF THE SCREW. Having finished this fine novel, however, I'm encouraged to read more James, particularly his letters and maybe a biography about him. Mr. Toibin's novel has the flavor and nuances, as best I can recall, of a Henry James novel, no small accomplishment. Toibin's James, though a bit like Eliot's Prufrock, is nevertheless a likable person and not so different from a lot of people I know. His sexuality is repressed, he has friendships with women whom he doesn't want to get too close to, he is the second child in a family of brilliant people-- William James being his older brother-- his father drinks too much, his beloved sister Alice suffers from emotional problems, he is attracted to men but doesn't act on his feelings, he is cowed by alcoholic servants, and he has a pushy woman friend from whom he has to hid a tapestry he has bought for his home because she told him he shouldn't purchase it. On the other hand, Toibin's James takes comfort in writing, in decorating a new home in Rye-- and while he sometimes may be lonely-- often enjoys solitude, something altogether different. "He loved the glorious silence a morning brought, knowing that he had no appointments that afternoon and no engagements that evening. He had grown fat on solitude, he thought, and had learned to expect nothing from the day but at best a dull contentment."<P>James through Toibin has poignant observations about life and death. "He realized that he did not even want the past back, that he had learned not to ask for that. His dead would not return. Being freed of the fear of their going gave him this strange contentment, the feeling that he wanted nothing more now but for time to go slowly." About his cousin Minny Temple who dies at an early age, James says that he "could control her destiny now that she was dead, offer her the experiences she would have wanted, and provide drama for a life which had been so cruelly shortened. He wondered if this had happened to other writers who came before him. . ." What a wonderful way to become immortal, to be fictionalized by a great writer. Near the end of this novel James tells Edmund Gosse that "'I am a poor storyteller. . .a romancer, interested in dramatic niceties. While mly brother [William] makes sense of the world, I can only briefly attempt to make it come alive, or become stranger.'" The same can be said of Toibin, himself. In this finely wrought novel, he has make Henry James, the master, come alive.</span>

                    <span>I've read most of James's novels and the five-volume biography by Leon Edel, and Toibin succeeds in this high-wire act of a novel to get inside Henry James's skin in a language that is remarkably Jamesian in its style and reticence. He has a deft hand when dealing with James's homoerotic longings -- which remain nothing but longings -- but also delves into his his relationships with the women whose friendships were vitally important to him and with his family, most notably his sister Alice and his brother James. Henry James really does come alive in this book -- even more so than in the biographies.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Most novels about the life of an author (or other artist) fall into the "Lust for Life" trap: they focus on the more sensational aspects of the author's life; and they portray artistic creation as a temporary madness, during which the author is taken out of him/herself into the exalted state in which a work of art is produced. James, by contrast, dealt in nuance and restraint, small gestures with enormous meaning, and unexpressed desires leading to endless regret. I felt that Toibin captured James' voice perfectly, both in his own writing style and in what he chooses to tell (and not tell) about the author. James was exquisitely sensitive and kind, but both his New England upbringing and his homosexuality (which, if expressed, could have had serious consequences, as the chapter about Wilde makes clear) combined to turn his warmer impulses inward. His personal life may appear to have been a series of (mostly) dead ends, but that's the tragedy that he turned into art. (And, having always thought of James as an effete man-about-town who happened to be a good novelist, I was surprised to learn how extremely hard-working a writer he was, generating a constant stream of essays, reviews, and stories.) The conversion of life into literature happens, not because of a visitation by the Muse, but by the continual gathering of small impressions and linking them together to form a coherent, compelling whole. James, an inveterate journal-and-notebook-keeper, gave his biographers a lot of material to work with, but this novel is far and away THE most convincing depiction of the creative process that I've ever read. A master as seen by a master.</span>

                    <span>Toibin captured the heart and soul of Henry James. I read this because I am a fan of the works of Henry James and felt that I was given a glimpse into the mind of the author. Toibin does this well, making me feel that even though I am reading fiction, I am getting an idea of the true thoughts and feelings of James. This book is truly sad. Toibin's James lives life as an observer. He realizes too late that he observes a bit too much and did not live life to its fullest.</span>

                    <span>Let me make a confession: I did not finish the book. I stopped at p. 200 something. If a reader cannot finish a book, whose responsibility is it? The reader is being too impatient or shallow the swallow the artistic messages inside the book? Or the writer is including materials that bore the reader? I think, in Colm Toibin's The Master, it's both.<P>I bought the book because I read an article in the local newspaper. I knew that this book is about Henry James' life which is re-presented in a fictional way. I am digging for his traces of homosexuality in order to know the writer more. That's why I found the first 130 pages of the book very captivating. The implicit signs of the homosexuality of the author and the language is very beautiful. However, the whole charm of the book just simply fades when it comes to revisit James' family matters. The book disappointed me at that moment in the way that I felt like I was reading a biography, including all those relatives doing this and that. These are all tedious pieces of information. Finally, I could not tolerate the insignificance of the plot anymore, so I stopped. Or I stopped because I have found what I intended to in the book, but I also closed it because I could not find anything similar anymore.</span>
