                <span id="Label1">Russell Sherman has been hailed as "that rarest of performers--a thinking man's virtuoso" (Chicago Tribune), and <i>Piano Pieces </i>is his scintillating excursion into the world of piano and its multiple spheres of affect and influence. From pithy reflections on tone, technique, and the thorny matter of thumbs to ruminations on how such a machine could be the voice and repository of priceless human messages both lyrical and complex, <i>Piano Pieces</i> examines the current status of music, piano-playing, and pedagogy through the noisy filter of contemporary culture.<br></span>

                    <span>I too have slogged through this book, searching for insights into playing piano and understanding musical form. Sherman's thoughts regarding the hand and the role of each finger are actually quite useful. <BR> Music is certainly not a perfectly linear art form, and everything mentioned does tend to eventually relate to everything else mentioned. Still, Sherman could have spent a bit of time organizing his free-associative style into smaller and more specific subjects. Perhaps the best way to think of this book is as a transcription of Russell Sherman's musings over after-dinner drinks, in a rather indulgent, expansive and reflective mood. A succinct text it's not.</span>

                    <span>While many (especially non-musicians, non-artists, non-students, non-teachers or non-thinkers) may give up on this book, there are many, many things to recommend it. Since the book is written in short, paragraph-long sections, one can jump all around, which is really how to read it. If you do you may glean numerous insights. Though prone to being pretty pretentious, Sherman has thought deeply about his work as a musician, pianist and teacher. He understands how mere technique does not make an artist, how simply hours of practice does not make a great pianist, and how music competitions are death to performers: in other words, things that need to be said! Sherman is able to convey these insights, and a patient, intelligent reader should be able to get beyond his admittedly weak style as a writer and make many discoveries.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I'm surprised by the reviews that denounce this book. Sherman's tone is at once informal and high-minded, which might limit the appeal of Piano Pieces to a particularly North American sensibility. Still, when I read it in the spring of 1996, I knew Piano Pieces would remain one of the most intellectually and creatively inspiring books that I would read on any subject. Sherman treats a range of issues related to performing the European piano literature by comparing it to, or locating it within, literary criticism, baseball, mythology, poetry, drama, aesthetic theory, art history, everyday life, personal experience, (American)consumer culture, and social history. In addition, Sherman's recollections of his own teacher, Eduard Steuermann, are touching and instructive. It is clear, too, that Sherman has learned as much from his students as he has imparted to them. Sherman has a searching, inquisitive mind that brings together disparate subjects and phenomena coherently and beautifully. <P>That said, Piano Pieces may not appeal to non-pianists and may turn off those pianists who, understandably, prefer not to think about how they make music. Still, this book is a fascinating record of a musical soul. <P>One more thing: prior to reading this book, I was only vaguely aware of Sherman as an instructor in the Boston area. After reading Piano Pieces, I sought Sherman's recordings and prepared myself for a series of disappointments. Happily, I found that he is a gifted performer. Although you may have to search for them, I especially recommend his recordings of Beethoven's piano sonatas and Haydn's piano sonatas. He is a thoughtful and surprising music maker.</span>

                    <span>Regrettably, I feel I cannot justify this book taking up ANY room on my bookshelf. Then I thought of giving it away, but I wouldn't do that to anybody I know. <P>What was he thinking ? Only years of academic study would equip you with enough prentension to understand what he is trying to get at - is he trying to make a point ? I kept reading, hoping for something enlightening, without result.<P>My advise is - Don't waste your time or money !</span>

                    <span>This book offers proof that you can't just throw together your journal jottings and expect to make a readable work. The author may be a good pianist (I've never heard him or heard of him, and I've collected piano recordings for close to half a century now), but he's a lousy composer. Of prose, that is. The short entries are both overly-intellectualized and intellectually unsatisfying. They go too far in their pretentious style and not far enough in content. The writer demands a high degree of concentration, but then doesn't come through with much to say, finally...</span>
