                <span id="Label1"><div>Namibia's popularity as a safari and adventure-activity destination has taken off exponentially, with a corresponding increase in the range of options available to travelers. A thorough update of accommodations and activities in game parks and towns alike is provided in this second edition, with descriptions of guest farms, lodges, and bush camps being exceptionally personal and comprehensive. The picturesque capital of Windhoek is covered in detail, but the main bulk of this exhaustive guide is given to the pristine yet accessible wilderness of Namibia--from the desolation of the Skeleton Coast and awesome Namib Desert to the lush Kavango and Caprivi Strip in the east. Guidance on visiting bushman villages, local culture, and eco-travel is provided. Desert activities for the adventurous include dune boarding, ballooning, and quad biking. Some pioneering, self-drive routes with GPS coordinates have been added to this highly recommended guide.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Having bought the Botswana guide I logged on to secure a copy of the new second edition of the Namibia guide, hoping for the same level of high quality up-to-date information...Sad to say some of the information is dated ... A couple of examples to illustrate: Sossusvlei is one of Namibia's most popular destinations. The road from Sessriem to the dunes has been sealed since 2000. The book mentions that "there is talk of sealing the road". Concerning Etosha, there is mention of Helios a long disused waterhole close to the Halali camp. This waterhole was closed before 1998! In mention of Andoni, north of the Namutoni camp, the author says that he has hardly ever seen any game in that area. This depends strongly on the time of your visit. At the end of the dry season September-November, VERY large concentrations of game can be seen in this area. Further in the Caprivi section of the book (last page) there is mention of the dispute between Namibia and Botswana over Kasikili/Sedudu Island. This dispute was settled by the International Court in Hague in december 1999. But not all is bleak, the guide, is VERY COMPREHENSIVE, and still makes an EXCELLENT choice for planning, as long as you check that the information is still current. Clearly some of the material is new to the second edition and thus is current...</span>

                    <span>I have been a world traveler for over a decade, relying on books and word of mouth for my guides. I found Namibia, by Chris McIntyre, to be an excellent resource for my prospective trip to the country. It not only has the information needed to become acquainted with the country and plan the trip, it emphasizes an all important and too often neglected focus: that of treading lightly and respecting the native people (bravo!!). I have typically sought out Lonely Planet books for my trips (I usually refer to two books for my information) and found that this book filled in a number of gaps that the afore mentioned book left out. I would recommend this book as the 'number one' book to anyone traveling to Namibia. The only thing this book lacked was a better section on local languages. Unfortunately I have found it difficult to find more than background information on launguge in ANY book on Namibia. Good Traveling!</span>

                    <span>This book is meant for the first time traveler to Namibia. The book is specifically designed to segment the various locations within the country and cover them in a well-detailed manner. A separate section in the book is dedicated to immunizations and other health related matters - important issues for travelers to Africa. The guide sections covering Windhoek (the capital) and smaller cities are very good giving a wide range of accomodations and restaurants from which to chose. The coverage of Etosha National Park is especially noteworthy as they provide tips on viewing locations for wildlife within the park.<P>Matters that could have been covered more effectively include internet website references for information on health precautions, tours (aside from those advertising in the book) and shopping tips. This information can easily be obtained with a quality search engine for the internet.</span>
