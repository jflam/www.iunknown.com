                    <span>Don't get distracted by the "operating manual for toothbrush" review below: it's a very useful little book. Yes, some information can be gathered online, and even on Google itself--but not all. I'm a fairly knowledgeable Internet user yet I've found a number of options in this book that I didn't know of before (even though I *have* read Google's online Help.) Moreover, a lot of people actually *are* "rubes" as far as the Internet, and there's nothing wrong with that, or with giving them a pocket-size guide where everything they need to know is gathered up in one place and described clearly and in a readable, systematic format. But the book is more than just that though--like I've said, I'm no rube here, yet I've found this little guide rather illuminating. Good book, good price: what else? Recommended for any Google user (is there still anyone who's not?) Get it.</span>

<br />Google makes it simple for anyone to do a search. This book helps make it simple for anyone to do a GREAT search.

<br />Well worth the money.</span>

                    <span>You've got to be kidding. I saw this and numerous other volumes at the bookstore about using Google and I laughed out loud. I had to pull this one off the shelf and see if it was a joke. After spending about 30 minutes flipping through it (that's about all it takes to get from front to back) I realized just how jealous I was becoming for not having thought of writing such a book first. The formula is simple - cull through readily available information on the Internet and repackage it in a friendly format for all the rubes with disposable income burning a hole in their pocket (come to think of it - isn't that the O'Reilly business plan?). What is so ironic is that Google was developed to be EXTREMELY easy - a true search engine for the masses. Its fundamental appeal is its ease of use, making guidebooks such as these silly at best, sad at the very worst. Take my advice, save your money and go treat yourself to a pizza.</span>

                    <span>Review<br>When I got this book from O'Reilly, my first thought was "How cute!  A little book for people who can't figure out a search engine."  After reading it, I either have to include myself in that group or change my opinion of the book.  This is really good stuff!<p>I knew there was more to Google than what I was probably using.  I've seen the Google groups area, I've used the image area, and of course I've done web searches.  But I didn't realize the power of the search syntax they use on the site.  I didn't know that you can restrict searches to document types, include/exclude sites or domains, include/exclude based on posted/updated date, decide whether you want the search term in the title, the entire page, or as part of an anchor link.  I didn't realize you could modify the URL on the fly to refine your search without going back to the search page each time.  I didn't know anything about Froogle.  And I definitely didn't know you could change your interface page to a variety of languages, including Klingon and pig Latin!<p>In a very concise, readable manner, the authors show you all you need to know to get started with the creation of much more powerful searches than you've had in the past.  And they repeatedly emphasize that learning how to use Google is best done by experimentation.  After reading this book (and it won't take you that long), you'll never view web searches in quite the same way again.<p>Conclusion<br>I used to say that if you give me five minutes, I can find what I'm looking for on the web.  After reading this book, I may have to revise that to three minutes.  If you get a chance to get this book, do so!</span>
