                <span id="Label1">Written in easy-to-understand language, The Darkroom Cookbook is the one source every photographer needs for the recipes for both common and rare photographic formulas.  This book shares tried-and-true techniques for the silver-based process and provides the keys to unlocking creativity through the mastery of the 'ingredients' of photography -- namely the chemicals used to develop, fix, stop and tone. <br><br><br>  The Darkroom Cookbook, 2nd Edition offers 170 photographic formulas, 20 of which are new to this edition, that cover film developing, paper developing, toners, stop baths, fixers, negative reductions, print reductions, negative intensifiers, paper intensifiers, and more. New information has been added on pyro developer, amidol developer, monobaths, pushing film, and low contrast development. Sections on safety and darkroom planning, as well as a listing of chemical suppliers, complete this book. The comb binding allows for easy darkroom use.<br><br>*Recipes for 170 photographic formulas and their specific uses, including 20 new ones<br>*In-depth analysis of which formulas work best under what conditions, as well as specialized conditions, such as working in extremely cold or tropical climates<br>*Handy, easy-to-access information on safety, suppliers, darkroom planning, and conversion tables</span>

                    <span>This book is an absolute must-have for the experienced printer who wants to step up to the next level. The wealth of information he provides, from technical to historical, is extremely interesting, albeit a bit dizzying at times. However, the book can be used as a reference as needed for information on specific chemicals, formulas, or resources for supplies and equipment. Of all the books that I have read on printing, this is the one that has been most useful.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Anchell has complied an excellent book for both people becoming interested in developing their own film and those who want to know more about the chemistry of photographic processing chemicals. There are sections on getting started building your own darkroom, previously tested formulae for developer, fixer, and other assorted solutions, and a full explanation of what each chemical does in the formulae if you want to create your own developer. I used this book as a reference in a college level photographic chemistry class and I found it invaluable.</span>

                    <span>As stated in the summery this is a great book for people who wish to advance in the darkroom; to have more control over their work. The Darkroom Cookbook discuss, in easy to understand concise language, how to make your own developers, toners, fixers, reducers etc. Stephen Anchell gives you the formulas to reproduce, in your own darkroom, a host of great developers etc. He also gives some basic info on hints and tools you will need to get started. A well written book easy to follow; though a little knowledge of basic chemistry is helpful. I am a new darkroomer and found this book has a wealth of inforamtion helpful if you like to expeirment. By the way, If you are just being introduced to the darkroom or rusty at it, don't buy this book at this momment. Wait untill you feel comfortable working in the darkroom using stock chemicals, this book might discourage some from beinning because it is a techincal manual.</span>
