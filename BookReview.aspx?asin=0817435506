                    <span>This book is one of the best I've read on learning to light...it doesn't spoon feed you lighting diagrams, it explains the principles of light, why light does what it does and then the author expects you to work with your own lights to see the results for yourself and LEARN to light.<P>Corbell does a super job of explaining different lighting tools...from hot lights to the various types of strobes available, reflectors, scrims and gobos...when to use them and why.<P>The diagrams and photographs are most helpful in explaining the text which is very clearly written.<P>Excellent...I wish I'd bought it ages ago.</span>

                    <span>I made a big mistake buying this bock, I should pay more attention to the reviews, the writer dose not go through details only big pictures with mentioning few general things, there are no satisfying details and diagrams.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the most inspiring photography books I've read. There are a hundred books about studio lighting that are little more than collections of photos followed by diagrams of the lighting setups. If you're looking for simple ways to duplicate somebody else's photos, this book is not for you. Instead, the author's intent is to make you understand the underlying principles of controlling light. He takes pains not to dictate rules or give formulas, but tries to help you make your own decisions based on your personal taste and the demands of a particular photo. <BR> <BR>This book, although it appears superficially simple, puts demands on the reader that many other lighting books do not. Some people would prefer to follow diagrams by rote; I'd much rather develop the mental tools to design my own lighting setups for my own needs, rather than look at the exact placement of lights that somebody else used. <BR> <BR>Corbell's explanation of the Chromazone system (for controlling the effects of gelled light on backgrounds) was more than worth the price of the book.</span>

                    <span>his pictures shows his techniques he's trying to explain but that's about it. very few picture, and whatever pictures are there are almost a page size. that's how he fills his book big pictures very few words. he doesn't talk about flash setup, what the camera was set at, lens & film used ,and so forth. the title says "..complete guide.." i find that very false. if you're in the store and see this book just look it over then leave it and look at something with more technical stuff. i sold my book after a week. the only thing i liked about the book was a few of the pictures. i find it hard to belive that this person is qualified to write a book nontheless teach photography. he never had formal schooling in photography. i also hate the fact that he pushes hasselblad equipment and their flashes. i'm sure he got a nice pay for advertising their products. i don't use hassy equipment and don't care to. i also think that he could have shown example work in 35mm format since this is what most people all over the work with. overral this book fails!!</span>

                    <span>This book does show you basic lighting techniques. It also goes through all the things almost every other photography book does. If your are looking for original ideas this is not the book. This book cannot spawn creativity because it is far behind the photographic learning curve. <P>The reader should note on this book (and all photography books) that this is a new edition not a new book. This seems to make a huge difference in the quality of photography books because of the learning curve I mentioned. Potrait (fashion, glamour, or anything besides landscape) photos taken two years ago, look out of date because they are behind the curve. How many people want to look at old tired photos? If you are one of them then you don't mind taking old tired photos and shouldn't read a book's review--- just buy the one with the 'coolest' photo on the cover.</span>
