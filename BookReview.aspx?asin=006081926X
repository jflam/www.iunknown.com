                    <span>In addition to strong plots and tension-filled scenes, Toole's style captures exactly the tone of the environment. he slips in and out of dialects and racial emotions like he's changing hats. The movie was great, but the book contains many other stories. A must read for any boxing fan.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Now that F. X. Toole has been discovered, with the explosion onto the screen of Clint Eastwood's brilliant and moving "Million Dollar Baby," the average reader wants to know more about him and read his other stories. Although Toole himself represents an amazing story, as a cutman and boxing addict and late-blooming author, his collection here is, as others have said, repetitive, filled with stock characters, and pretty much a single story. But so what? The story is a great one, and Toole spent a lifetime learning its plot. At least he got it done, wrote a knockout piece, and had it transformed into a masterful movie that's a lasting work of art. The vicious cruelty he portrays in the long story, "Rope Burns," which takes place at the time of the Rodney King riots, is hard to bear, as is the realistic, nasty dialogue. But I was convinced that Toole has lived what he tells, and that makes the story even more sad and unforgettable. Hey: Toole isn't Hemingway. He's a guy telling his story in a reasonably literate fashion. I give him lots of credit for having the guts to step out there and do it!</span>

                    <span>I'm not sure what's not to like about this series of short stories. Those who don't like F.X. Toole seem to fall into two categories.  Either his characters are stereotypes or he's not literary enough.  I found some genuinely interesting characters and stories with a point that are a refreshing change from the dusty introspective work that comes out of so many university creative writing departments these days.   Toole was a careful observer of the craft of boxing and probably an ardent reader of Hemingway.  His writing is traditional, and he's a wonderful storyteller.<p>If you like boxing novels like "The Professional" or "The Harder They Fall" but found reading "Fat City" to be a pointless chore, then this book is for you.</span>

                    <span>The reviewer who wrote the "NOT A CONTENDER" review hits this book on the head. I too listened to Ellroy's recommendation and like that reviewer found the book to be lacking...it's not that the book is awful mind you..it is just that it is full of cliche characters adn repetitive themes.</span>

                    <span>Like a right lead, this book is effective and surprising, but it is left vulnerable. Toole does an excellent job of decribing the gritty, intense, and certainly brutal boxing life in each of the six short stories contained in this volume, but he doesn't really examine anything new. The stories tend to have fairly bland characters and involve recycled plots, but this is tolerable because the writing is excellent. While I was never on the edge of my seat because the stories were relatively predictable, I did not want to put the book down and was eager to start the next story as soon as I finished one. This isn't what I would call great literature, but I would recommend it to boxing fans or anyone who was a Rocky fan, Rope Burns is right up your alley.</span>
