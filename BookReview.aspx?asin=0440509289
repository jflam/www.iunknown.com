                    <span>All personality books offer generalizations and this is no different.  The authors, however, do acknowledge the limitations of the Myers-Briggs test (in contrast to Please Understand Me, a worthless book).  I had my staff take the MB test to see how they scored and then had them read and use the book in exercises to understand how their communication with and peception of others is affected by their personality.  It was an interesting process and got them to realize that some of their interpersonal conflicts start in their head.  A good choice for team building and organizational development.</span>

                    <span>This is just one of the books that shows you how to use personality/psychological type at work and is worth reading. It covers nearly all issues we face in the modern workplace like communicating with  co-workers, handling stress in the workplace, ethics, time management etc.  all from a Type perspective. Kroger and Thuesen do a good job at explaining  how Extroverts handle things differently from Introverts, Sesates from  iNtuitives, Feelers from Thinkers, & Judgers from Perceivers. Apart  from this, in between it gives various tips on how people with different  preferences can better understand and work with each other. It also tells  interesting tales about the happenings in the workshops they conduct and  how they explain to people that its because of their personality  differences that conflicts arise and what they could do to prevent them. It  even has some jokes at the end of the book. <p>I thought that the cream of  the book was the descriptions of the 16  personality types. My type  description was extremely accurate and insightful and three or four of the  points mentioned in that seemed shocking to me because they described what  went on in my mind and its something only I knew about.<p>But beware - It  isn't so good on finding out what your type is. <p>Overall, a good read!</span>
