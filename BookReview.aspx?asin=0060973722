                <span id="Label1">In <i>Men at Work,</i> political pundit George Will breaks baseball down, parsing it into essential tasks: hitting, fielding, pitching, and managing. Why do some succeed grandly while others are more apt to whiff? By analyzing the way Tony Gwynn, Cal Ripken, Orel Hershiser, and Tony LaRussa approach the game and do what they do, he finds striking similarities in intelligence, dedication, drive, and desire.</span>

                    <span>I agree with the reviewer who said this reduced baseball to a tech manual, removing the passion.  I got the impression that Will enjoys baseball because it allows him to feel sophisticated. I enjoy baseball because it's a thinking man's game, but half of that equation is GAME, with competition, passion and celebration for the winners.  At best, Will captures some of that passion in his book. But more often than not, it makes it seem more of an engineered factory product.
<br />
<br />There are occasions when I really enjoyed the book. I love baseball, and I do love the minutia. It's fun getting behind the scenes to watch Tony LaRussa's coaches work together, and to see the pure hitting mechanics from a master like Gwynn.  But I suppose the simplest way to put it is--it's too much of a good thing at times, it becomes mundane, repetitive and boring way too often.  I think my baseball education--via the Yankee radio announcers, ESPN.com columnists and OTHER books--has been sufficient, and a lot more fun than this. Check out any of Halberstam's books, or John Updike's essay about Ted Williams' last game titled "Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu," if you want pure literary baseball magic.
<br />
<br />One last thing--consider these two baseball titles. "Men at Work" versus "The Boys of Summer."  Interesting the different images they bring to mind. I prefer the latter.</span>

                    <span>Hey George from Florissant, how about those Cardinals now??? Still bashing LaRussa??? Why don't you get over your Whitey Herzog obsession and enjoy the fact that the Cards play hard every night. If you had cable you'd be able to see that most other teams don't do that. <br>La Russa is a great manager and this is a pretty good book.</span>

                    <span>"Men At Work" is a great, great baseball book. Is it as good as "The Summer Game", "Five Seasons", "A False Spring"? Interestingly, it is and it isn't. Technically it is. It contains superb reportage and loving writing about a game George Will adores. But the there is a technology to Will's writing, a one-two-three, a but-for premise that borders on lawyering, advocacy. I love it, yes, but I have to rate this just below the pure romance of Roger Angell or the raunchy, man's-man baseball-as-life stories that infuses Pat Jordan's work. Will has written here a book that precursors "Moneyball". It describes the new age of baseball, an age of computers and preparation that replaces the Joe Schultz "Let's beat 'em, then pound some Budweiser" era described by Jim Bouton's "Ball Four".<p>STEVEN TRAVERS<br>AUTHOR OF "BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN"<br>STWRITES@AOL.COM</span>

                    <span>George Will is a pompous ass who knows even less about baseball than he does about politics. In this rag, he states something to the effect that Tony LaRussa is the perfect manager....that if you were going to construct the perfect manager  you would end up with none other than Tony. What a crock. Just ask any Cardinal fan, who see his inept moves every day, what they think of LaRussa. I could name at least 50 managers that are more skilled. Go back to politics and your big words. You know nothing about baseball, George.</span>

                    <span>George Will shows his passion for the game in this work.  As a baseball fan myself I can appreciate the technical aspects of the game and therefore this work.  If you are no more than a casual fan I am not sure this is the book for you.  If you are an avid fan, however, or wanting to learn more about the intricacies of the game then this book is for you.  In lengthy detailed interviews from some of the games best you'll learn about all the little things that go on during a baseball game that you simply can't get from a box score.   Pitching, coaching, managing, defense and hitting are all covered.  Will addresses them all adequately and with quality, classy athletes.  A must read for any true fan, old or new.  While the players are retired now it is still worth any young baseball fans read.  It will give you a much greater appreciation for the game as a whole.  I can't wait for Spring Training.</span>
