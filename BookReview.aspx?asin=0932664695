                    <span>What I like about this book is that it has fill-in-the-blank review questions at the end of every chapter so that you can test yourself on the information that you just read. It primarily focuses on sensory evaluation of wines and how to describe them.</span>

                    <span>Finally! This is the wine book I've been searching for! Dr. Baldy presents a wine appreciation course in a serious yet accessible format that goes far beyond the surface-level information provided in typical books on wine. She not only writes about aromas and flavors in wine, she discusses sensory perception and how to develop it. Having taught for many years, she understands her students' concerns and insights, and both shares and addresses them for the readers, giving us the sense of being brought into her classroom. Her approach is systematic, practical, and thoroughly enjoyable. Each unit includes a quiz, practical exercises, and supplemental (though now somewhat dated) bibliography. The book is designed in such a way that it can be adapted for personal study, for use in small groups, or in a classroom setting. This is a very welcome addition to any serious wine-lover's libary.</span>

                    <span>Who else has explained the scientific reasons behind the making, taste, and food-matching of wine in such a friendly, easy-to-follow way? No one. An award-winning teacher of enology and genetics, Professor Baldy's years of wine making and teaching experience show: she respects wine learners, so she gives them the technological wine information they must have in order to understand wine and their reactions to it. And mixed in with these thorough scientific presentations, Marian's tasting exercises and humorous comments guide readers to use what they learn to increase their daily appreciation and choice of wines. Thank you, Dr. Baldy, for a major, needed work.</span>
