                <span id="Label1">The <i>Java Cookbook</i> is a comprehensive collection of problems, solutions, and practical examples for anyone programming in Java. Developers will find hundreds of tried-and-true Java "recipes" covering all of the major APIs as well as some APIs that are not usually covered in other Java books.  The <i>Java Cookbook,</i> like the bestselling <i>Perl Cookbook,</i> covers a lot of ground, and offers Java developers short, focused pieces of code that can be easily incorporated into other programs. The idea is to focus on things that are useful, tricky, or both, and the book should serve as a great "jumping-off place" for Java developers who want to get started in areas outside of their specialization.</span>

                    <span>OK, you've learned the basics. You know 'public static void main string args' from a hole in th ground. What now? I teach Java at a college. Only a small percentage of my students are CS majors. Most introductory java books lack good practical problems to solve. The Java Cookbook is a list of common problems and code examples on how to solve them. I learned more in two days with this book than I did with several very good java books because I need to see examples and how things work in context. If you're like that too, you'll love this book. I pack it with my laptop so I'm never without it when I need it -- it's that useful to me!</span>

                    <span>I'm very into a method of programming called "R&D"... that stands for "Rob And Duplicate". I'd rather not invent or reinvent something if I can "borrow" someone else's solution. Given that as my mindset, I LOVE this book!<P>While the hardcore reference books are necessary, all too often the beleaguered developer is left asking for a simple example of how something works in a real program. Sometimes it's nice just to be able to see a class (like the Java I/O classes) used in the context of a complete solution. From there, you can figure out how to start using the class in your own program. That's the real value of this book. I may conceptually understand what a class does, but it's sometimes hard to translate that knowledge into syntactically correct code. Seeing an example helps me get a grasp of how it is really used.<P>For Notes/Domino 5 developers, this is an extremely useful book. Many Notes/Domino developers are used to using and sharing solutions that have already been coded and solved by others. This book will feel very natural to them. It allows you to get a core set of code working, and then from there you can expand to work into a complete coding solution.<P>Conclusion<BR>Regardless of where you are at in your Java career, you should have this book. If you're a Java newbie, it will help you bridge the gap between reference manuals and real programs. If you're an experienced Java programmer, it will give you different perspectives on how a problem could be solved.</span>

                    <span>--<BR>addendum 07/2004 - I used this book until it fell apart on me (not the first O'Reilly book to have done that, BTW). This is the source I reach for first when tackling a new problem. I eagerly await the second edition, apparently coming soon.<BR>--<BR>addendum 09/2003- you know, I've had this book for a while now and while the java.sun tutorials are OK, there are times when you need just a basic little client to do something and I keep coming back to this book and its code. I don't use his packages but I do use his Q&D examples for things I don't use a lot like JNDI and Native Code.<P>To run with the cookbook metaphor, this book is full of recipes for ten-minute soup while Sun's site is more like "First the seed is planted, then cellular mitosis expresses genetic characteristics...let's stop to look at the details of nucleotides, shall we?" <P>--<P>My original review was <P>great for beginners but quickly trips over itself. Darwin writes classes to help the beginner, which is nice for running his examples but not much else.<P>The examples are nice but java.sun.com has better and more recent stuff. <P>Not badly written, not a terrible book but I can't recommend it due to the evolution of high quality tutorials and examples on the Javasoft web site.</span>

                    <span>This book has almost 800 pages of incredibly useful information. If you're unsure of how to do something in Java, it's a pretty good bet there is an answer in this book. The second edition includes coverage of the Java 1.5 release (such as generic types and enumerations) and updates or adds missing info from previous versions (such as the Java regular expressions API).<P>Most of the "recipes" in the cookbook have reference to other "recipes", online resources or other books - and not always other O'Reilly books, which implies (at least to me) the author really wants to get you the best information possible. Also, both the Table of Contents and the Index are well laid out and will help you get a quick answer to any question you may have.<P>The book assumes you have basic Java knowledge, but I'd recommend it for any Java programmer, beginner or advanced. There are a lot of examples included in the text and you can download the source from the author's web site. This should be at the top of any Java developer's list of books to own. <P>Highly recommend.</span>

                    <span>[A review of the SECOND EDITION, 2004]<P>The salient feature that distinguishes this second edition from its predecessor is the coverage of Java 1.5. The overall format of the book is unchanged. There are over 100 "hacks" that address common problems a Java programmer might face.<P>The grouping of hacks into chapters is quite logical. But you are expected to already know the basics of Java programming. This book is not meant to teach that, but to help fill in gaps in your overall knowledge framework. The solutions are typically easy to understand. That is the tenor of the book. You can quickly see if a solution fits your needs and then easily apply it.<P>The 1.5 features are sprinkled throughout the chapters. Because the numerous changes from 1.4 are distributed over many aspects of the language. So Darwin correctly chose not to aggregate these into one location. Which also means that this book is not the place to learn specifically about 1.5 as a whole. (Try "Java 1.5 Tiger" by McLaughlin and Flanagan.)</span>
