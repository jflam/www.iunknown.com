                    <span>As an IT professional, I found this book packed with good information. The overall style is updated and compatible with the times, and the many examples are creative and varied. Too many "cover letters" cling to the old school of "Enclosed Please Find" formality of another era. In these times, it's equally important to communicate some idea of your style and personality to give an employer a more complete picture of what they're getting when they think of hiring you - that extra something that makes you pleasantly unique from the 500 other cover letters in the pile.
<br />
<br />For my field, I almost never use paper anymore for letters or for resumes, so I found the info on email throughout the book to be very useful. Most books I've seen barely cover it at all or the authors don't quite grasp its limitations. 
<br />
<br />I also liked the way the book analyzed the cover letter examples of what worked and what didn't, and why. The exercises were a bit vague but you don't really need them to get the most from this book. It's worth every penny. 
<br />

                    <span>This book is decent if you're looking for a back-office/blue-collar type job.  The tactics are very basic and the examples are childish and the format quite unprofessional.  If you're looking for a real cover letter guide for the most competitive jobs look somewhere else.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book.  Lots of examples, lots of 'why' and 'how to' sections.  It's laid out in a useful way making the book an ongoing reference.  There's a great section on resumes as well.  The out placement company prepared a resume for me that was more a five page tome.  I used the resume chapter in this book and quicly kicked my search into high gear.  I only wish I had bought this book sooner.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This is the best book on the market for writing cover letters.  In addition to giving many articulate cover letters to peruse, the book has sections with examples of introductory paragraphs, middle sections, and closing paragraphs.  For each of these examples (I think there were more than 40 for the intro), there is a pro and con given, which are really helpful.  Also, the book goes over the many different kinds of cover letters that exist, and explains which type is best for each job situation. <p>Oh, and for those people who are recent graduates or don't have that much experience- there is a whole chapter for you with examples of very strong, well written letters. This is particularly nice because most cover letter examples in other books are strong letters because of the strong candidate- not because the letter is extremely well written.  There is also a chapter for the professional with years of experience.<p>This is the only book you need for writing cover letters! Do not waste your money on other guides that are not as complete.</span>
