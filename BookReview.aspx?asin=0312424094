                <span id="Label1"><div>A modern classic, <i>Housekeeping</i> is the story of Ruth and her younger sister, Lucille, who grow up haphazardly, first under the care of their competent grandmother, then of two comically bumbling great-aunts, and finally of Sylvie, their eccentric and remote aunt. The family house is in the small Far West town of Fingerbone set on a glacial lake, the same lake where their grandfather died in a spectacular train wreck, and their mother drove off a cliff to her death. It is a town "chastened by an outsized landscape and extravagant weather, and chastened again by an awareness that the whole of human history had occurred elsewhere." Ruth and Lucille's struggle toward adulthood beautifully illuminates the price of loss and survival, and the dangerous and deep undertow of transience.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Upfront let me state that I think "Housekeeping" is a book worth reading. The writing is lyrical, profound and often awe-inspiring. This is the story of two sisters, Ruth and Lucille. The death of their mother has forced them to live with a series of relatives, each of whom has moved into the family home. The final relative to arrive on the scene is their Aunt Sylvie, a non-conforming drifter whose eccentricities make her suitability as a mother figure questionable at best. She collects garbage in the living room, rarely cooks or cleans, doesn't care whether the girl's attend school, and likes to ride the rails. Lucille yearns for a "normal" life and eventually rebels against and leaves this unconventional household. Ruth seems to lose herself and her pain in this strange lifestyle, and becomes Sylvie's soulmate. This novel is a complex examination of what constitues a "normal" homelife, and how our society places much credence on outward appearances, often caring little for what goes on behind closed doors until it may be too late. While I believe Sylvie was a caring figure, I also believe she was not the best choice to raise these children, and ultimately they paid the price for that. This is not a happy story with a tidy ending, so if you like your fiction that way this is likely not the book for you. However, if you are willing to think beyond the box for a few hours you will be rewarded with a rich reading experience.</span>

                    <span>Housekeeping is a wonderful book to read. It is a story about finding and having a place to belong. The main character, Ruth and her younger sister Lucille grow up in one house but are raised by four different members of their family. Throughout the book it is clear that Ruth and her sister never lose the feeling of being homeless and alone. On page 66 Lucille says that she is tired of being alone and wants to find other people. Then Sylvie replies "Loneliness bothers lots of people....".<BR> I really enjoyed reading this book because I was able to get inside the characters' head and feel like I was in the story. Everything was so real it was like I was Ruth and I was feeling what she felt. And all the images painted such a clear picture for me, that just added to my feelings towards the book. But what I didn't like about this book was that there was no happy ending. It ended with no conclusion. I would have liked to kept on reading about what happened with Lucille and Ruth and Sylvie.<BR> I would highly recommend this book to someone because it was a good story and it had situations that people could really relate to. I also liked the style of writing that the author used. She starts out by giving some background information and then takes the story form there. Another great thing she does is she introduces the different characters as they come in and tells a bit about them. She also does a great job in using descriptive words so that the reader is able to picture the scene from the book in his or her head. "...suave cones or mounds, single or in heaps or clusters, green, brown, or white depending on the time of day." It was a wonderful story and I wouldn't mind reading it again.</span>

                    <span>In the novel, "Housekeeping", sisters Ruthie and Lucille are hastily dropped off at their Grandmother's house. Their mother--a rather odd woman who seems to suffer from bouts of depression never returns. The grandmother raises the two little girls, and after she dies, two elderly relatives take over the task. But then mysterious Aunt Sylvie returns and stays to take care of the girls. The problem is that Aunt Sylvie is more than a bit strange--"Every story she told had to do with a train or a bus station." Sylvie is, in fact, a transient, who has returned home to assume responsibilities that she doesn't want and that she's really mentally and emotionally unprepared for. <P>This is quite simply a beautiful novel. On the back cover of my copy, other writers and critics praise the book, and in particular, the writer's lyrical use of language is mentioned--over and over again. As readers, we are used to flattering reviews of books, but the praise for Robinson's use of language is not hyperbole. "Housekeeping" is an exquisitely written book. I can't really think of a writer whose skills compare with Robinson's talented use of language.<P>The novel is set in the small town of Fingerbone, and the family home is set next to a daunting and often deadly lake. The descriptions of the terrain are quite amazing: "Buttercups are the materialization of the humid yellow light one finds in such places...but the deep woods are as dark and stiff and as full of their own odours as the parlor of an old house."<P>Ruthie--the sister who bounds closely to Sylvie, narrates the novel. Their home life is far from normal, and the sisters' opinions about Sylvie become a pivotal part of the story. Sylvie's failure to conform is acceptable only within certain boundaries, and once those boundaries are crossed there is no turning back. This is a story about conformity, loss, and identity. I heartily recommend this haunting novel. I read it many years ago, and just recently re-read it after I saw it on a top-100 best book list. I think I appreciate it more for the second reading--displacedhuman.</span>

                    <span>Let me give you the scoop on Marilynne Robinson. She is a classy woman and writer. I am taking a seminar with her cureently, as a student at the Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa. No one has shown me more about literature in just a few weeks than this scholar and artist has. Housekeeping is a work of elegance and majesty. May her colleagues at the Workshop worship her as I do. They might learn something in the process!</span>

                    <span>I found this book on my book club reading list and wanted to give it a try. As wonderful as this story is, you must have a long time to read this book. It will start off very quickly and it seems to be moving right along. Next thing you know it has been weeks and you can't seem to finish the chapter. I have been told by other people who have read this that it has happen to them. You find yourself slowing down to the pace of the story. If you have the time to read "Housekeeping" do it, otherwise wait until you have the time.</span>
