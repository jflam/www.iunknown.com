                <span id="Label1">With <i>What's So Great About America</i>, Dinesh D'Souza is not asking a question, but making a statement. The former White House policy analyst and bestselling author argues that in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, American ideals and patriotism should not be things we shy away from. Instead he offers the grounds for a solid, well-considered pride in the Western pillars of "science, democracy and capitalism," while deconstructing arguments from both the political Left and political Right. As an "outsider" from India who has had amazing success in the United States, D'Souza defends not an idealized America, but America as it really is, and measures America not against an utopian ideal, but against the rest of the world in a provocative, challenging, and personal book.</span>

                    <span>This is easily D'Souza's best book. He ties together various points to produce this composite which thoroughly explains why America is the best country in the world. Liberals are simply unable to answer the following questions that destroy their intellectually bankrupt arguments that buckle under the slightest scrutiny.<P>He explains why Liberals believe the following seven lies :<P>1) America is rich only because it has stolen money from other countries. Africa would be rich if America had not stolen from Africa. Even the wealth created in the last 10 years from software development was the result of exploiting the Amazon jungles and the Congo.<BR>2) Blacks in the US deserve reparations, even from people who's ancestors came to the US much later than the Civil War. Even Asian American taxpayers who arrived in the 1970s must pay reparations to Blacks who would otherwise be wealthy in Africa had they not been taken from there. Blacks are continually discriminated against by whites to this day at every possible opportunity. The fact that black immigrants from Dominica and Jamaica are doing much better than African Americans means that they are selectively not subjected to racism, even though their skin is even darker. <BR>3) The SAT is racially biased. The fact that Korean, Chinese, and Indian students do better than whites still means that it is biased against blacks. <BR>4) All rich people are rich because they had rich parents. If someone has poor parents, they have no chance. Communism, which fairly redistributes the fixed amount of dollars in the US, is the only fair solution. Even the immigrants who became rich after coming here (Andy Grove, George Soros, Vinod Khosla, Arnold Schwarznegger, etc.) have exploited others. <BR>5) Bush's tax cut only favors the rich. The person making $300,000 was paying $100,000 in taxes, and now will only pay $80,000, getting a refund of $20,000! The person making only $20,000 was paying $2000 in taxes, and now will still pay $1500, getting a refund of only $500. It is unfair that the rich person gets a refund that is 40 times larger than the poor person! They should get a refund of the same size! The fact that the rich person is STILL paying $80,000 while the poor person is only paying $1500, or less than 2% as much, is irrelevent. The rich are evil, and we have to take it away. <BR>6) We have NO right to attack the Taliban, even though they don't allow girls to go to school and force women to wear a burkha. Women in the US, however, are still held back by the glass ceiling.<BR>7) All the world's cultures are equal. The fact that immigrants from every part of the globe want to leave their countries and come to the US is not a valid point. I do not need to visit Africa, China, Brazil, or Iraq to know that their cultures are better than America. It is okay for China to massacre its own students at Tianamen, and conduct genocide against Tibetans and Uighurs, but it is wrong for the US to attack the Taliban while providing food for the Afghan people. <P>If you are a conservative who is angered by liberals who put forth these arguments, you will find indestructable firepower for your next argument in this book. No other book provides so comprehensive an arsenal to demolish the liberal shibboleths as this one. You will also know when you have WON when liberals say 'you are dumb' or 'you don't know' without putting forth an intelligent sentence. <P>If you are a liberal who thinks the above are true, read this book if you actually believe in free speech (liberals usually only believe in free speech when it consists of their own liberal intellectual incest.). Prove that you are not a hypocrite and read this book.<P>Note that the fools giving this book one star do not actually point out any flaws in D'Souza's reasoning, but just scream about things not relevant to this book. That is because D'SOUZA HAS ALREADY ANALYZED AND DEFEATED THEIR POINTS, and they have no choice but to cry in protest to their being outwitted and embarrassed. Read this book before your next debate against some liberal pseudo-intellectual. <P>Liberals are so dumb that their fanatical beliefs have actually become their religion. They are religious fanatics to just as great a degree as a Crackpot Christian. <P>Liberals are also incredibly racist - they hate D'Souza only because he is a dark-skinned person who does not subscribe to their fanatical religion of liberalism.</span>

                    <span>I usually don't write reviews of books that already have scores of them already written. After all, what could I possibly have to contribute that somebody else hasn't already said?<P>But I finished this book literally minutes ago and I consider it one of the best books I've ever read. An Indian immigrant, Mr. D'Souza brings a unique perspective to the topic of American culture and politics. He lays out a realistic and intellectually impressive argument that "there is something great and noble about America." He revisits the history of Western civilization and offers an interpretation that is foreign to any contemporary student of American and European history: that--above all else--the West, with America embodying its ideals, has had an undeniably positive impact on people's lives throughout the world. <P>D'Souza takes on tough issues, like the impacts of slavery, racism, colonialism, and the cultural permissiveness that the non-Western world hates, with skill as a writer and erudition as a philosopher, historian, and political analyst. "What's So Great About America" is my first D'Souza book, but it certainly will not be my last. Mr. D'Souza's writing is personal and smooth; he seamlessly weaves anecdotes with facts, history with philosophy, and humor with logic. I couldn't get enough of this book.<P>One last note that is important to make is that Mr. D'Souza is as far from partisan (or even ideological) as one possibly can be. He takes on everyone from Noam Chomsky to Robert Bork. Don't dismiss the book upon seeing its title. It is not the "feel-good" book that the cover makes it out to be; it is profoundly intellectual, even eye-opening. It will, if nothing else, broaden your worldview.</span>

                    <span>I first came across this book while browsing the politics section at B&N. I initially laughed at it because of its simple title and the American flag it had drapped across its cover. That alone didnt cause me to laugh however. The real reason I laughed was because I was then a young college student who was being bombarded with only negative information about my country's current culture as well as it's past history by the supposed "educators" in charge of my intellectual development. This book completely shattered the worldview they had worked to create in me. Thank you Dinesh D'Souza.</span>

                    <span>He has a unique perspective of America. You can't get this view from the prominent media in the US. He destroys many myth's being proprogated by the "liberals." There are many Americans living in America who hate America. Dinesh D'Souza is not one of them.</span>

                    <span>In 430 BC, shortly after the outbreak of the philopenesean war Pericles faced the dilemma of how to articulate the blessings of freedom (which were taken for granted) to the people of athens and compel them to make sacrifices and the ultimate sacrifice of ones life. Pericles said that they have the sweetest life of all and in order keep the good life possible they must create an eros for their country. This eros will justify the sacrifices that are needed to protect athenian liberty. <BR> dinesh dsouza posses this kind of eros and shows us that In the world today America has the good life. A life which deserves our sacrifice. In the book he describes Americas greatness through refuting the criticsms of all of america's worst critics from judge bork to noam chomsky and reverened jesse jackson.<BR>The good stuff: 1) dsouza shows why America is NOT a racist nation like so many people claim.<BR> 2) Contrary to popular belief The west is not wealthy because they stole everyone else's stuff<BR>3)Dinesh conceded that we went into Iraq in part for oil. unfortunately we only go fight for human rights if we can make some money out of it. During 1996 Liberals wanted us to go way into Africa and fight in the middle of the damn jungle?! c'mon guys dream on!<BR>4) dinesh states that avoiding war with muslims is impossible because they won't rest until we're all dead. So much for pacifism.<BR> Concluson: really enjoyed the book. Particularly good if your a highschool or college student (like me) who has to deal with liberal B.S from your teachers or other students every day.</span>
