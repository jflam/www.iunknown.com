                <span id="Label1">The book that changed the way computer books are written and marketed has come out in a third edition. By and large, it's the same as the previous edition (advances in MS-DOS have not been numerous), but there is some new information here. Further, <I>DOS for Dummies</I> remains an entertaining book and if you use DOS, it's the book you want to assist you.<P> The basic idea of this book is that you can identify a problem you're having with your computer, ranging from how to turn the thing on to how to back up only the files that have changed since the last backup. You can then turn to the relevant section--the table of contents is very detailed--read a few pages, carry out some procedure, and move on to the next problem. You'll find sections on hardware, file management, text editing, and software installation. Later chapters deal with troubleshooting. <p> The newest material in this release of <I>DOS for Dummies</I> deals with DOS 6.22 and the DOS-like shell that you can use under Windows 95 and Windows 98. For users of the latest versions of Windows, Gookin demonstrates some relevant procedures. But most of the coverage deals with DOS itself and programs that are designed to run under DOS. There's even stuff about WordStar here (it's a little-known fact of history that the Rosetta stone was written with WordStar).<p> <I>DOS for Dummies</I> is funny, too, in a wry sort of way. What kind of joke is appropriate to a section about parallel ports, anyway? The author manages to infuse practically every passage with humor. Other computer books should make an effort to take themselves less seriously. The verdict: if you're using DOS--and more of you are than the Windows people would have us believe--this book will provide you with valuable help. <I>--David Wall</I></span>

                    <span>like I said, good book, but a bit outdated. The author talks about 50 MByte disk drives as being huge and about 5 inch floppy disks. This is like reading Aristotle's physics instead of Newton's. If you use DOS it will help you of course, but ignore most of the talk about hardware. Covers DOS commands very well. Contains interesting trivia about computers too (the life span of a hard drive is about 4 years, unless this is outdated too). To conclude, if you use DOS, it will suite you. Even better seem to be the DOS reference book for Dummies.</span>

                    <span>I thought that the book was an excellent book. It easily told you what DOS is doing, and why it is not as good as MS Windows. The book also gave the difference between the different DOSes there are. There is not much to say about this book , only that it is a great book. I have to say, DOS is very annyoing and slow, and the book really pushed that. That is why I am giving this book a 4</span>

                    <span>This book has little or no real content. It looks good on the surface but there is nothing underneath.<P>In the interest of system safety the author has left out so much information it leaves the book essentially useless. Worse, it gives the impression that some of the things you may need to do can't be done.<P>This book may be okay for teaching children a limited use of dos but anyone that has any judgement at all needs more information.</span>

                    <span>This book is a good book for becoming familiar with the DOS operating system and all the commands, but it lacked any information that would be helpful to people who want to become intermidiate-advanced users. For example, the author refuses to tell you anything about BATCH files, which really annoyed me. There are over 10 commands that had to do with BATCH files that there was only the most basic information about, and the book said that if you wanted to write a BATCH file executing a program with another name (doom.exe instead of doom2.exe, for example) then ask a friend to do it. What kind of advice is that for a book about DOS?</span>
