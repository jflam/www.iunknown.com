                    <span>Sometimes a title says it all, and Madam Secretary is essentially the sum and substance of Albright's claim to fame. She was the first woman Secretary of State and probably one of the worst Secretaries of any department in any era. Admittedly she worked for a morally bankrupt man who governed based upon what the polling data showed, but this book reveals that the ship of State was rudderless and without a compass. 
<br />If the titles "Clueless" and "Sleepwalking through History" weren't already taken, they would have been much more apt descriptions of Albright's tenure in such serious posts as Secretary of State or Ambassador to the UN.
<br />The initial chapters were interesting in her personal history as her family moved from Czechoslovakia and to the USA, but it was all downhill after that. 
<br />I kept turning hundreds of pages looking for some substance or recognition of her true impact on world events but couldn't find any. Her refusal to be "baited" at the UN and defending the USA by rabid haters of the USA and instead making jokes about how it made her feel "young again" was telling. She glosses over the North Korean violation of the "framework" negotiated between the new Clinton Administration in 1993 and 1994 by the peanut farmer and never acknowledges that this "framework" was violated by the North Koreans from day one, but somehow blames the Bush Administration for calling an end to this charade by revealing the fact that the North Koreans never lived up to their commitments. The bombings by al Qaeda of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania the year that Osama declared war on Western Civilization? No connection that she had anything to do with it or the impact of the US tepid response. What about Clinton hiding behind her skirt and sending her out to defend him when he lied to her and the nation about Monica? It was all Ken Starr's fault. Arafat lying through his teeth about Palestinian terrorism and using the White House as his platform? Not a problem. Rwanda and the greatest genocide in modern history since Pol Pot as hundreds of thousands of Tutsi's were hacked to death? Boys will be boys, and besides, the UN didn't want to get involved. Any thought about how Saddam built billions of dollars of palaces under the Oil for Food program that she supported? An audit program? What and upset the French who were collecting the billions involved in the program thru Paris banks?. Mon Dieu!! 
<br />This book is much more spin than substance, but I actually think that she doesn't recognize the difference. If you want to know why we were so highly thought of by the enemies of freedom, you can read all about it here. We were very, very nice when we should have been very, very determined. If you want to know just how the world became such a dangerous place on her watch, you might be better off saving the dollar I paid for this book and asking some wino on a park bench. Most have them have a better understanding of the real world. The Freudian analysis of this book's title is that she may have been the biggest Madam in Foggy Bottom while she was in charge of the house located there called the State Department. The problem is that she is probably unaware of the fact that it may not necessarily be a compliment.

                    <span>After thinking about buying this book for several months, I finally did and I can not tell you how much I enjoyed it.  I picked it up on my way of town on my vacation to Rome thinking the large size would be easier to tackle over a vacation than in my normally hectic life.  It is a page-turner and was hard to put down even with the sights of the day in Rome waiting.  I laughed at her witty insights and funny anecdotes, I cried tears of hope and joy reflecting on what a breakthrough her achievements were for all women, and cried tears of sorrow as she relayed the events surrounding her discovery that she was of Jewish heritage and had several family members killed by the Nazis.  Madeline Albright is a witty, dignified, lovely, intelligent, interesting woman who is an inspiration to all.  I hated when I finished the book as it was wonderful to have Madeline in my life for a time.  It is more chit-chatty than I expected, but I would compare this book to Kay Graham's autobiography.  (I actually enjoyed this one more).    </span>

                    <span>I wish I hadn't put off reading this book. I never imagined I would enjoy it so much. 
<br />
<br />I would have never thought a political novel would keep me anxious for every page, but hers did. I enjoyed the mix of serious commentary and humor. Although it seems that she could have written more in some places it does seem candid overall.
<br />
<br />Albright's writing style is very comfortable. She sticks to the point and presents her thoughts clearly. I felt as if I was being told stories by my own grandmother. I have a newfound respect for Albright as a role-model for todays young women.
<br />
<br />I especially enjoyed her personal accounts of the "non-public" side of several world leaders.
<br />
<br />I see some reviewers complain that this book didn't have enough hard hitting politics, but it does say it is a "memoir."  I wasn't looking for policy choices or political analysis, I was looking for history from the point of view of one woman on the inside, and I found just that.</span>

                    <span>Powerful and smart, persistent and captivating. All that sounds very convincing. The things that is missing - making money from the conflicts and destruction.
<br />
<br />One could not find in this book a single word about making money on the post-war privatization in what used to be Serbia. They targeted 200+ publicly owned production facility but only couple of tanks. Then, Madam Secretary's firm was making sure, that its clients could get those factories for peanuts. Nobody could account for all activities by Albright Group LLC in the world, but its latest role in "helping" Kuwait with Iraqi debt is well covered in the latest edition of "The Nation" magazine
<br />(...)
<br />Someone will call it politics, others will call it business. Billion here, billion there - who cares, US taxpayers will cover all those debts and pay the price for the high ranking war profiteering.</span>

                    <span>I was looking forward to this book as research material for the Clinton era, the Kosovo Campaign in particular.  <p>What a mistake.<p>As an example of revisionist self-congradulation, 'Madam' Secretary has produced a well-written biography.  But where is the self-criticism one should expect from a Secretary of State?  <p>She certainly admits some hard decisions, but no wrong ones (at least, not by her).  We see again and again that inter-state (and intra-state) conflict muddies ethics, morals, and national interest.  I just don't see how a political autobiography could come away so squeaky clean.  Now that I've read the book, I think I can use it to wash the dishes (although it's a little heavier than a bar of soap).<p>Her self-portrayal as a feminine icon flies in the face of global reality and conjures comparisions to Halle Berry's Oscar Speech.  There are plenty of hard-working (and really self-sacrificing) women out there in greater positions of relative power:  Look towards India, for example.  'Madam' Secretary doesn't cut it on an international scale.<p>Politicians aren't saints.  You know it, I know it.  Politicians are faced with terrible realities of power, lobbying, and making decisions that always hurt a lot of people.  The social reality is that showering doesn't remove the stink.  Washing their clothes doesn't clean the stains.  Hillary Clinton knows it - at least her bio was interesting.  Reading 'Madam' Secretary's is like reading Chicken Soup for the Political Soul.  Read someone else for the realism.  <p>If you want to sink your teeth into something substantial, go for one of Kissinger's, Clinton's (either one) or Roosevelt's bios (FDR, not Teddy).<p>If you want to sink your teeth into something that's so sweet it'll make them rot, try 'Madam'.</span>
