                <span id="Label1">With the introduction of Flash MX, the folks at Macromedia have transformed a pretty cool designer's tool for Web-based interaction into a full-fledged, professional-level application for developing sophisticated online content. Serious tools, however, typically require some serious instruction-and Flash MX is no exception. Luckily for you, there's <B>Macromedia Flash: Training from the Source.</B><P>Using hands-on, project-based tutorials that you can tackle at your own pace, this invaluable reference provides the instruction you need to start designing professional-looking Web sites. Veteran author and Flash master Chrissy Rey takes you step-by-step through the development ofa complex Flash project, grounding you in the basics before moving on to more complex topics like ActionScripting and the use of video. In the process, she covers both the old and the new, including the revamped user interface, the text and graphic tools that make their debut in MX, and the brand-new Properties inspector.  With Flash MX on your computer and <B>Macromedia Flash: Training from the Source</B> at your side, you're ready to take on the world of interactive online content.</P></span>

                    <span>I looked at about 15 Flash MX books at the bookstore before deciding on this one (although I admit I couldn't find Foundation Flash MX which is supposed to be good as well.) This book is the only one I found which doesn't fall into the usual categories of application books: 1) Extended manuals which regurgitate what the program does but don't really teach you well, 2) Designer techniques which are for people who already know the program.<P>This one really takes you by the hand and helps you through designing an actual flash website so you are applying basics skills to a real-world project step by step.<P>Everything is really clear and well illustrated. The writing is fresh and clean and non-technical. It goes into every bit of the program that you need to do 95% of what most people use Flash for. It is setup like a training course not a reference manual and there is a throughline from beginning to end. Very well laid out with precise description of what you will learn per lesson.<P>The CD has all the files you will need included on it and plus there is a companion website.<P>Bottom line -- if you like diving in and exploring on your own this may be a bit limiting, but if you are a complete newcomer to Flash and would rather work on real examples not random feature explanations -- BUY THIS BOOK NOW.<P>Well worth the price (especially here on Amazon) unlike alot of application books out there. I can't wait to get the ActionScript volume as well.</span>

                    <span>I've had this book for three days now. This book really does take you by the hand and walk you through using the tools and building a very simple; amateur website with flash mx. I don't feel like I'm getting anything from this book. The tutorials included with the flash mx program do just fine except for building a website. This book falls very short as far as the feeling of accomplishment in building a website with impressive animations etc....; that's what flash is supposed to about; FLASH not FLUSH. There are too many books out for flash mx that try too hard to familiarize you with the mx environment and do little to teach you on how to create those cutting edge animations that we are so accustomed to seeing these days. One chapter on tools and basics would be fine (both in one chapter) the rest should get you wet with animating (today's standards) and action scripting; none of the books today do a good job of this. You either have to be an action script master or a baby taking it's first steps. <BR>Pass on this one; Use flash itself and the tutorials then try to get a grasp for action scripting with one of the other books. I haven't found one yet.</span>

                    <span>I'm currently covering the book, the presentation of the material is straightforward, the author gets you up and running with a project as early as chapter 2 - granted that the degree of difficulty varies chapter to chapter.<P>Again, don't expect anything more than a "tour" of Flash, more in depth books are available. The reason I started with this book is to gain familiarity with the tools of Flash, get working on a quick project, and then advance to other books/training sources.<P>Overall, it's not 5 worthy, but I'll give it a 4 since it does a good job of giving me the upper-level details of FlashMX and ActionScript.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I'm going to try to write the most balanced and fair review I can. Let me begin by writing about what the author got right.<P>First of all, this was probably a VERY difficult book to write. As an author myself, I have to sympathize. Flash concepts are difficult (because they're so intricate), the Flash interface is very difficult (because it's so intricate) and putting all the pieces of a movie together is difficult (because they're so intricate). This would be a very difficult book to write.<P>Second of all, the author was VERY good about explaining how to perform each step, even after she explained it a million times. For instance, the flash interface is so difficult that you may forget how to center a a shape. Everytime she asks you to center a shape, she tells you, again and again, how to do it. It must be very frustrating for an author to explain things ad nausem like that. But for a topic like flash for beginners, it's necessary.<P>The illustrations are great.<P>So that's what the author got right. Now I'll go into what she got wrong. I'll give you the punchline right now, though. The bad outweighs the good. By a lot, considering the amount of time it takes to go through the book.<P>I fully agree with deltatangou's review. The book is highly non-linear. It jumps from this to that, and can be accused of being very disorganized. She's meticulous in detail, but this kind of "from A to H and then from B to W" type of learning is not suitable for some kinds of people.<P>I suspect that this book might be good for people who have solid memories and like to learn things "by the seat of their pants". Many artists I know are like this.<P>However, if you're a methodical learner, and use knowledge to build on previously learned knowledge, this book will make you dizzy. You'll wonder "what the heck did I learn two chapters ago". You'll feel like you did a bunch of examples but didn't learn much.<P>The book is "goal oriented", and takes a top to bottom approach. The final goal is some flash project about a virtual zoo. This only aggravates the problem. Again, top to bottom learning is great for "seat of the pants" learning. You learn what you need to know, when you need to know it. Personally, I don't learn this way, but perhaps you do. I find it very difficult to see the trees through the forest with this book.<P>The only other flash book I've seen (and I've only thumbed through it) is the "Flash in 24 hours" book. From my percursory glance, it looks to be more suitable for me: it looks like it takes a bottom up approch.<P>Anyway, I'm giving this book one star, with the provisio that perhaps there are people who like to learn this way.</span>

                    <span>First of all, don't be fooled by the title "Training From The Source" or the Macromedia logo. These books are NOT a product of Macromedia. This book jumps from point A to point G; and then from point H to point C. There is no logical flow of information that will help you build an understanding of what the author is trying to convey. I strongly recommend that you look to another source for learning Flash (and all other "Training From The Source" books; as they all seem to have the inherent problem of missing information, no logical flow, and continued frustration for the serious student who is forced to look to another source to get conclusive and comprehendible training).</span>
