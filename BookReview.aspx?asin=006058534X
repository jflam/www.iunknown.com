                    <span>She suggests we recreate our lives from negative thinking to positive love.  The only problem is that some people will not accept your love, acting as if your status as a decent human being is beneath them because you are poor in finances, not abilities nor intelligence.  They are afraid of you because of social status, or lack of.  Only the rich and powerful are worth anything in America.
<br />
<br />She states that God will help us to change the world.  What if parts of the world don't want to be changed?  Spiritual giants have humility in abundance, minus the ego.  According to a verse in the Bible, ICor. 15-51, "we shall all be changed -- in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound..."  She obviously is talking about the end of the earth, or as some call it the Rapture.  Most of us won't be around to hear that trumpet.  Custer heard his!  And what good did it do -- he still died.
<br />
<br />When you are upset or in pain over a larger social reality (a public agency), it's impossible to know who you should trust.  So many gloss over the problem (which is very real to the person harmed or abused), and try to suppress it.  They ignore what is happening, hoping it will go away, but it never does.  It continues to fester until the boil it causes bursts open and a 'can of worms' is opened for all to see.  That way, no one ever wins.
<br />
<br />One of her 'key bridges of transformation' is to live in the present, not the past or future (who knows if we or our world will have a future), to go from forgetting who we are to remembering who we are.  I say, we should never forget who we were, as our experiences have made us who we are now.
<br />
<br />She preaches that we should go from "who we were" to "who we are becoming."  When she ages twenty more years, she will hold onto the good memories of who she was as opposed to being old, isolated, ignored, abused mentally, and be glad that she still has the wits left to remember that 'once upon a time' she was somebody.  Like we all are at certain periods in our lives.  It is not good to bury that in your subconscious.
<br />
<br />Other books, Ms. Williamson has had published include A WOMAN'S WORTH, EVERYDAY GRACE, and HEALING THE SOUL OF AMERICA.  As far as my reading goes, I feel that America has no soul.</span>

                    <span>I understand that a world in which only Love is real and hate, anger, and anything else that is not "good" does not exist, sounds wonderful. But the teachings contained in this book are not Christian teachings. 
<br />
<br />This is a separate new Religion called "The Course" and it's teachings attempt to combine many different religious principles. Unfortunately, most religious thought is exclusive to itself. Some examples are the Muslim belief "There is only one God, and his messenger is Mohammed". Any statements or philosophies that differ from this statement would no longer be Muslim. For Example, if someone states that Mohammed is not really a prophet, but a great teacher of values. This is a perfectly fine statement to make, but disqualifies as encompassing Muslim beliefs. The same is said for Christianity John 14:6 states that "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.'. 
<br />By releasing a book which claims that followers of this new religion should be OK with a belief system that does not coincide with what Jesus, Mohammed, or Buddha taught, we should then realize that this book is not for Christians, Muslims, or true followers of other religions. For Christians, I would recommend reading The Bible to get a good understanding of Jesus Christ and what he taught.
<br />I rate this Book with 1 star because I feel it is misleading to trick readers into thinking they are following a certain religion, when in fact, they are following something completely NOT of that religion. I don't appreciate literature that misleads people this way.

                    <span>My review is truly biased toward my personal needs-first off.  With subject matter in regards to change, I would rather prefer cold hard facts.
<br />
<br />Williamson's voice in this recording is soothing as she addresses the audience.  However, the over-flowery content in this book leads me to sleep rather than pay attention. Williamson sounds more like a meditation instructor than an expert of metaphysical studies.  However, the text probably has better meaning if you read the book instead.   
<br />
<br />This book is more for the emotive idealist.  Sounds soothing but not enough hard facts for people with harder hearts like myself.   </span>

                    <span>This book has made me think about everything: my relationships with friends and family, my relationship with  God (which basically has been non-existent over the years) and my relationship with the English language and how I communicate.  For someone who is struggling with  God issues:  who is God? etc. this is an excellent book to crack open and travel down the road of revelation.  I highlighted the heck out of this book.  Almost every sentence packs a wallop.  One night while reading a page, I was overwhelmed with the message.  Got chills, tears....it was so inspiring.   When a book does that, it deserves five stars.</span>

                    <span>I feel that Marianne Williamson is one of the best inspirational authors and thinkers of our time. Her eloquence in her writing and her insight is amazing and it has changed my life in more ways than one. I want to thank her for her work and for this book, which is just one more gift on top of everything she has done for me. This book can chage your life.</span>
