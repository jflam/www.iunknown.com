                <span id="Label1">The perilous ramifications of the September 11 attacks on the United States are only now beginning to unfold. They will undoubtedly be felt for generations to come. This is one of many sad conclusions readers will draw from Craig Unger's exceptional book <I>House of Bush House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most Powerful Dynasties</I>. As Unger claims in this incisive study, the seeds for the "Age of Terrorism" and September 11 were planted nearly 30 years ago in what, at the time, appeared to be savvy business transactions that subsequently translated into political currency and the union between the Saudi royal family and the extended political family of George H. W. Bush. On the surface, the claim may appear to be politically driven, but as Unger (a respected investigative journalist and editor) probes--with scores of documents and sources--the political tenor of the U.S. over the last 30 years, the Iran-Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan, the birth of Al Qaeda, the dubious connection between members of the Saudi Royal family and the exportation of terror, and the personal fortunes amassed by the Bush family from companies such as Harken Energy and the Carlyle Group, he exposes the "brilliantly hidden agendas and purposefully murky corporate relationships" between these astonishingly powerful families. His evidence is persuasive and reveals a devastating story of Orwellian proportions, replete with political deception, shifting allegiances, and lethal global consequences. Unger begins his book with the remarkable story of the repatriation of 140 Saudis directly following the September 11 attacks. He ends where Richard A. Clarke begins, questioning the efficacy of the war in Iraq in the battle against terrorism. We are unquestionably facing a global security crisis unlike any before. President Bush insists that we will prevail, yet as Unger so effectively concludes, "Never before has an American president been so closely tied to a foreign power that harbors and supports our country's mortal enemies." <I>--Silvana Tropea</I></span>

                    <span>What a remarkable job Craig Unger does of pulling together disparate threads into what becomes the easily identifiable quilt that is the Bush-Saud relationship. I cannot think of a more important work of non-fiction written over the past thirty years.<P>In part because of the conservative criticism they drew, my last three reads were Plan of Attack (Woodward), Against All Enemies (Clarke), and The Price of Loyalty (Suskind). I'd heard of House of Bush, but it didn't seem to be drawing much ire from the right. Now I see why: It's footnoted and chapter-noted to the extreme; its facts beyond reproach. There are simply precious few (if any) chinks in Unger's armor for the right to attack. I've yet to see any serious criticisms of Unger's work. (You can bet the book's been picked apart, yet I've not seen anyone publicizing factual inaccuracies. There's simply no spin to use against Unger's masterful marshalling of the facts.)<P>This book -- and Michael Moore's movie -- should be made available free of charge to Republicans and Independents in battleground states. You can't read the one or see the other without being profoundly bothered (though I'll concede that Moore can be a tad over-the-top).<P>In years to come, this book should be required reading in history classes worldwide. My thanks to Craig Unger for setting the record straight.</span>

                    <span>I read this book with an open mind, which I think is especially necessary when it comes to this book, and the information that I learned startled and deeply saddend me, but it also left me feeling empowered, because it opened my eyes and I hope you will want to open yours too!<BR>The book is based on facts, the author includes his sources and also, since I finished reading the book I have found numerous articles, in "The Chicago-Sun Times" supporting facts from the book. I also know that the movie "Farenheit 9/11", by Michael Moore, discusses some of the issues brought up in the book and even the 9/11 commission has reviewed issues brought up in the book, such as the evacuation of all Saudi Arabians after 9/11, with the permission of the White House, when all flights were supposedly grounded.<BR>It is a VERY important thing to note that, the book's author backs up everything that is talked about in the book, so it is not a "Bush-bashing" book!!! The book is written to inform the American people about the, very real, secret relationship between the Bush family and the House of Saud, that basically run Saudi Arabia, and how this relationship has effected the American people and the U.S's relationships with other countries; fortunately this relationship is now slowly being exposed, through this book and the media.<BR>It really does not matter whether you love or hate the book, what is important is that you read it and pass it on, because it is our responsability as Americans to stay as informed as we possible can, so that we can make the best decisions we can for ourselves, our loved ones and for our future generations. <BR>You will take what you want from the book and leave the rest, but I promise you that you will never forget reading it and it will change the way you look at the world of politics and the people who run this country.</span>

                    <span>Read this and vote accordingly! The links between big business in the USA and between the House of Saud are truly scary. Granted, the Crown Prince really does want to reform the country, and should be credited accordingly, but many of the House of Saud are not so inclined and if Saudi Arabia blows up it will make Iran in 1979 look like a picnic in comparison. We should urgently be working towards empowering the small core of pro-Western Saudis rather than making deals with the Princes, and this book shows us how in a very thorough way.

                    <span>House of Bush, House of Saud is a must read for those who are interested in the current political situation. It is well written and well documented. For those who challenge its message, they should note that the book is footnoted almost to the extreme. The editors did a great job of making sure that every statement is documented. And critics should also note that no one has sued the author for false statements.<P>A great read for those who want to rebut people who say that Bush made the right decision about going to war and for a follow up to seeing Farhenheit 911.</span>
