                    <span>As the owner of a national exercise and rehabilitation equipment company and after reading this book I give this book a 5 star rating. From the first page I realized how easy it is to follow and implement into my life. This book not only addresses excellent protocols to increase driving power, add touch, and reduce injuries, but explains WHY the exercises are done! So, if you know you weakness, or already have low back, or shoulder pain (most common), then, this book is for you! This book makes it much easier to address your weakness and then turn around and get the results your looking for out on the golf course! <P> The key to a successful book is the results the reader gets out of it! My hats off to the team who put this one together!<P>Allen Woodruff President & CEO of Synergy Therapeutic Systems</span>

                    <span>Bought this thinking it would give me some useful exercises for my golf game. Unfortunately, the exercises and ideas are so basic you probably could guess 90% of what's in here. Maybe this is truly all a person needs to know, but I have to think there are some better and more creative approaches out there. Not at all inspirational or motivational.</span>

                    <span>Book summary: 1) do basic weight training exercises at high repetition to maintain strength without bulking up, 2) follow basic nutrition regimen, 3) maintain flexibility using traditional stretching exercises, 4) you can only excel at golf if you are long and lean. There truly isn't a new thought or idea in the entire book. Do yourself a favor and pass on this stinker.</span>

                    <span>The only plaudit I had for this was Els tells people fitness is good for golf. That has become obvious, so what's best for me? I would get a stretching book, a weight lifting book and something on nutrition before I would buy this again or recommend it to my golfing friends. Unlike Els drives, this was a hook into the woods.</span>
