                    <span>After being promoted to management, I needed to learn how to manage. And my company offered us three day's worth of training... hardly enough to really grasp the ins and outs of how to shape other's behavior. However, the most highly skilled of the presenters mentioned this book, and felt that behavioral modification was the only true key to managing effectively.
<br />
<br />I scoffed initially.
<br />
<br />Being a twentieth century American, I thought behaviorism was dead. Skinner struck me as cold ... but, being a scientific and open-minded man, I purchased the book. And I'm glad I did.
<br />
<br />I can say this without batting an eye: because of Aubrey Daniels' book, not only are my teams consistently strong performing teams, I know how I got there. So, when I get a new batch of team members, I can apply the same principles, and see the results right away. In fact, learning about this book is the most useful thing I learned in that aforementioned week of leadership training.
<br />
<br />What are Daniel's principles? First of all, that people do what they do because of reinforcement. Reinforcement comes in two main forms: positive and negative. Negative reinforcement does not necessarily mean punishment, but that positive reinforcement is withheld. Punishment is a subset of negative reinforcement, largely overused. 
<br />
<br />Daniels then goes on to show the "ABC's" of behavior (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequences), and illustrate why some behaviors are not easy to shape (the consequences are uncertain). Once you understand the basics, it becomes easy to look for opportunities to shape your reports' behaviors by rewarding what you want then to do ... making the UNCERTAIN consequence CERTAIN: "If I do this, my manager will be happy," instead of the UNCERTAIN, "I am not sure if this will work... Will my peers scoff at me?..." Daniels finishes up with several insightful case studies about how his principles have been applied in the real world. This can give you solid ideas on how to apply them in your neck of the woods.
<br />
<br />
<br />All told, one of the greatest, most practical, and easiest to use management books I've read. And, thanks to Skinner and a rash of behaviorists in the 50's and 60's, the most scientifically validated. </span>

                    <span>Wow - This book, if you are willing to listen, will help you become aware of what is going on around you. At least, it did for me. Every couple of pages, I found myself saying "oh .. oh yes.. of course!" If nothing else, this book made me realize that I'm not crazy nor am I alone; that my environment, particularly the standard salary compensation system, really is de-motivating. No wonder I and so many others often struggle with procrastination!<p>The concepts are explained very well and he does a very nice job drawing out the implications to specific examples that most readers will immediately relate to. This book was one of the most satisfying reads I've had in a long time.</span>

                    <span>Dr. Daniels brings the subject of behavior analysis to a level where human resource managers can understand the concepts of performance management and actually apply his principles of scientific employee management. For anti-behaviorists (those who fear being controlled by the human tendency to adapt behavior in order to receive rewards and avoid punishment) this book is a nightmare. Daniels succinctly describes the behavior analysis process and how employers can use it to improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency by "pinpointing" job performance standards and incentive programs. A must read for any manager. His chapter on incentive plans was particularly insightful and illustrates the fallacies of most reward systems.</span>

                    <span>A different approach to changing behaviors.  A very scientific approach that uses sound reasoning.  The performance matrix may be the single most useful item in the book, but the whole topic of performance and compensation seemed to very applicable to corporate compensation.  I would recommend for anyone looking for a more scientific approach to motivating employees.</span>
