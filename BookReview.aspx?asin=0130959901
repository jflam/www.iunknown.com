                    <span>Ignore the other reviewers comments who are lazy and/or incapable of doing the end-chapter problems, it's amusing how many people repeated that(like parrots).<br>Some problems take more time and require compact understanding of concepts explained so far and some are easy, I used the book for an independent study course and it's readable, presenting a good deal of material, and includes quite funny comments in the text. I recommend it.</span>

                    <span>Andrew Tanenbaum might be the best there is when it comes to the study of computers but, unless you're a "thorough geek," you'd wish other technical writers would step into the fore.<p>Tanenbaum's books all use the same single technique to help students remember important ideas:  bold letters.  That's it.  You'd be hard pressed to understand the main concepts most of the times because, like a forgetful professor, he'd sometimes mention it in passing (without bold font) that you think they weren't that important.  Until one pops up in one of his chapter problems, then you're through.  <p>He does not provide any solutions at the end of his books.  One gets the sense he wrote his books for the instructors/professors who are too lazy (or uncreative) to come up with their own sample problems for the students.  I wish they'd write computer science books the way mathematicians write their books: They assume their students are "mathematically-challenged" so they go that extra mile to make sure the students get the point.  They provide answers to odd-number problems, for one.  They also make sure the layout of their books are arranged so that students don't miss the main ideas.  With Tanenbaum, you'd have to dig everywhere; you don't know whether to search in the current, previous, or the following chapters for help in answering the problems.<p>I still have a few more semesters of computer science; I'm almost sure all the textbooks would be written by Tanenbaum (again!).  I dread the thought.<p>So, Tanenbaum, if you're reading this:  Please, please, look for another publisher and editor who would help you in the layout of your book.  And please, please, provide some answers to some of your problems for the students.  At over a hundred bucks, I want my money's worth!</span>

                    <span>At times this book had some interesting points to make, but it was mostly nightmare to try to learn from.  I agree with all of the previous negative reviews that mentioned the book's vagueness and lack of answers to the chapter's questions!  I found myself frustrated when I repeatedly read the same page over and over again.  It is possibly one of the worst text-books I have ever read.  I actually read this book in my class and I received terrible grades when our tests ended up being based on those end of chapter questions without answers.  When I wondered how the rest of the class got good grades, it turned out because most of the class was cheating (many got caught during the final!) and getting the answers from google searches.  So maybe I learned something from this book and maybe I didn't, but I would recommend against buying it unless you have to.</span>

                    <span>Tenebaum apparently is a very smart guy, maybe that's why he was so not on the level of the students (like me) who had to read this book in my undergraduate course. It annoying when you read a chapter twice, and you are still like "what is this guy talking about?" Then in trying to answer some questions at the end of the chapter, you discover that nothing in the chapter adequately prepared you for the question.<p>The beginning chapters were actually okay, like the layer descriptions, floating point numbers, circuits/gates, multiplexers. The problem is when he's done giving a fine inroduction to a topic, he delves into stuff which I must say makes no sense. The parts on parity bits and bits in general was crazy. Though I grasped some concepts, I did a lot of feeling in the dark.<p>If you're using this in a class, hopefully you have a professor that'll do a good job of breaking down the material. Else, invest in another book.<p>NOTE: i find it suspect that the ratings range from 1-5. I've thot about it and made my own conclusions.</span>
