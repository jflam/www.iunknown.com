                <span id="Label1">Imagine a world far, far into the future. A world very different than our own where people have been wiped out by massive climatic and geological changes, nearly destroying the Earth. What would the world be like, and what kinds of creatures could survive? An international team of eminent scientists was formed to predict the future and its new life forms in five million, 100 million and 200 million years. The scientists predicted that the Earth would go through several phases, including Ice World after five million years, Hothouse World at 100 million years and New World at 200 million years. To portray the scenery as accurately as possible, a camera crew traveled to remote locations around the world. State-of-the-art animation helped bring to life such freakish beings as Flishes combining the characteristics of birds and fish, the giant slimemold known as the Slithersucker, the Toraton tortoise bigger than any dinosaur, tree-dwelling squids called Squibbons, the spewing Spitfire Bird and many more!</span>

                    <span>The Future is Wild is easily one of the most original and unique consepts for a film in a while. Showing the world of the far far future. When humans has gone (how or why is not explained) and the world has returned back to the primitive world is once was. This DVD version of the movie is quite different then on Animal Planet. Some new details are added it is also missing completly the space prob. My guess is the space prob was just Animal Planets form of political correctness. The Future is Wild is extremely imaginative. The bizzare future animals it predicts are very cool. Scientist explaining laws of evolution and using examples of modern animals make this future world more probable. It takes three time periods. 5 million years, 100 million years, and 200 million years in the future. As expected the more time goes on the more bizzare the animals get. 5 million years we see giant swimming birds, giant running birds, giant bats, giant rats, running lizards, desert pigs, and rattlebacked rodents. This is a world of ice were creatures are scrambling to survive in the cold. 100 million years the world has warmed up. We see turtules bigger then the largest dinosaur, amphibious octupus, giant killer bugs, four winged birds, and poisionus birds. 200 million years in the future a mass extinction wiped out all mammels, birds, and reptiles. However we have swimming lobsters, super sharks, flying fish, hopping snails, plant worms, and squid that swing from tree to tree. All of this may seem to weird to be true but the world of 200 million years ago was just as different. These future animals are shown using computer animation in live action environments. While it is clearly inferior to framestones television projects the animation is good enough to serve its purpose. This 5 hour series spans over three discs. All are presented in anamorphic widescreen. DVD lacks any special features on the animation and has only 2 channels of sound. Theres more then enough disc room for a 5.1 track and at least some extras. This is a bit dissipointing but I still recommend The Future is Wild. It is a glimse at our possible future world. Remember Evolution Never Stops.</span>

                    <span>Travel to what the future MAY be like, 5 millions years from now, 100 million years from now and 200 million years from now. It is a solid mixture of science mixed with wonder as we shoot ahead, through an Ice Age, a heat wave lasting millions of years and many other changes that force animals to change and evolve to survive. Most of it is very interesting and while the DVDs have no extras, the episodes do, in the form of scientists explaining in detail what examples of animals in the past or in the present allowed them to design such wonderful new future creatures. They also talk about social behavior, changes to the climate and to the Earth's land mass itself.<BR>Sometimes the CG looks a tad fake, but kiddies should enjoy it. Be warned, like many nature shows there are predators killing prey or animals 'failing' to survive.</span>

                    <span>To put it simply, if you enjoyed the Walking With Dinosaurs documentaries you'll love The Future Is Wild. Luscious photography, and terrific cgi mixed with live action effects.<BR>In this future of the earth depicted here, mankind is long<BR>extinct. Earth has returned to it's primitive paradise. Strange<BR>and stranger new life forms have emerged. Such as giant landwalking squids, monolithic turtles, and carnivorous fish that literally electrifies their prey. And many strange vistas.<BR>Many of today's leading scientists were consulted for this<BR>documentary to present their views of earth's future. Extremely<BR>entertaining. If you are looking for something truly out of the ordinary, The Future Is Wild is your ticket. Enjoy.</span>

                    <span>Despite the fact that the narrator on this fine 3-DVD set somewhat annoyingly pronounces evolution "ee-volution," fungi "fung-GEE," algea "al-GEE," and says "future beetles" so that it sounds like "fuchsia beetles" when the beetles are obviously not fuchsia, this product is worth buying! I am even going to take screenshots from this fantastic DVD boxed set. First of all, it is NOT the same programs you've seen on Animal Planet, with that much more irritating narrator who insists on showing us the humans showering, from some unspecified corner of the universe, their satellites to future Earth and sending back photos, over and over and over again. That annoyed me because it made the show feel like some science fiction trip. IT'S NOT. This DVD makes everything clear and totally believable because it has a narrator that treats the material seriously, frequent scientist comments that explain the reasoning behind it all, and extended sequences. On TV we didn't see footage of certain animals like Spitfire Birds and we didn't learn of the Toraton mating ritual. Also included are impressive modern-day animals such as the white praying mantis that disguises as a lotus flower, & the amazing armor-plated anteater called the pangolin.<P>Watch out for Prof. Bruce Tiffney; he's a funny guy, to say the least. A quintessential "mad scientist"-looking man, I must say. The DVD's are long; one is over two hours, the others are an hour and forty minutes apiece. Thirteen episodes neatly divided showcase perfectly for viewers the well-predicted animals of the future we will never see. My personal favorites would have to be the: Gryken, Scrofa, & Desert Rattleback (Disc 1), the swampus, reef glider, & Great blue windrunner (Disc 2), and the garden worm, rainbow squid, & Desert Hopper (Disc 3). To sum it up, the DVD set is completely awesome! Colorful, informative, and fascinating. I give it two thumbs way up!</span>
