                    <span>This is the story of a lost reporter working for a dead end newspaper finding adventure in 1950s San Juan.  On the surface, a story that only Jimmy Buffett could love.
<br />
<br />What makes this story special is the view it gives you to pre-Gonzo Hunter S. Thompson.  The story is wild, frayed, on the verge of unbelievable, but it is not yet Gonzo.  In a sense, it a first look at the hypermanic greatness to come, written in a more sane and moderately paced prose.</span>

                    <span>This book does not reach the humor or excitement that Fear and loathing in Los Vegas did but is still a good book, with a day-to-day style of a middle-aged man working for a newspaper that consists of mostly drunk and oddball employees. This book isn't really for the people who are looking for another exciting Thompson book but for someone interested in the Thompson style character in a late 50's setting (before drugs and true craziness). A great look into a working class Puerto Rican life but nothing over the top.</span>

                    <span>Paul Kemp, a New York journalist leads you through the twists and turns of a time when a corrupt goverment and ignorant tourists ran rampant throughout San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
<br />Hunter's first novel displays a knack for the uncanny and unheard of style of writing only destined to be gonzo. Although his trademark style of writing is not yet developed in this book, this relatively short (200 pg) book still grips you by the innards and forces you to read on. 
<br />Strangely enough, the narrator and main character, Paul Kemp reminds you a lot of Hunter and leads you to believe you are reading a non-fiction account of his days spent in sunny San Juan until you look on the binding and realize that it is indeed a novel. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a brief yet illustrious getaway into the depths of the caribbean underworld.

                    <span>A fun read  about a man trying to find his reward for a lifetime of rebellion. The book introduces several very flawed characters with strong personalities and has them run a paper in Puerto Rico. The main character, Paul Kemp is a rebel hero that reads people very well but doesn't get overly neurotic about trying to help them or change them.  Underlying it all is Kemp's sense of a wasted past and a more wasted future, and his search for the reward that would make it all worth while.  Don't let all the nhilism fool you, the balls of rebellion pull through and the book is a riot!
