                <span id="Label1">This handy-dandy little book aims to prove that not only are great  workplace leaders made, not born--they can be made in 72 visually snazzy pages  or less! In a quick-reference thumbnail format, it shows you how to learn from  others and develop the personal strengths that will make you into a good leader,  form and lead effective teams, exercise authority and delegate tasks,  communicate clearly and set clear goals, and, finally, to inspire excellence in  others through motivation, establishing a shared vision, managing "openly,"  boosting achievement, and being adventurous. A seminar's worth of boxed tips,  checklists, and flow charts bring it all to life for you, from getting the most  out of meetings to assessing your own leadership skills. Granted, if you're  looking for very specific or in-depth guidance, you may find this book too  cursory and general in its approach. But if you're looking for a thumbnail guide  to the basics, it'll do you just fine.<p>It's worth mentioning that the book is  also part of reference publisher Dorling Kindersley's Essential Managers  series--20 itty-bitty li'l books on business and career topics ranging from  communication, leadership, and decision making to the management of time,  budgets, change, meetings, people, projects, and teams. Combining the <i>For  Dummies</i> book series's talent for breaking down a lot of information into  bite-size bits and sidebars with Dorling Kindersley's signature design style of  crisp, classy graphics on a gleaming white backdrop, they don't represent the  cutting edge of business thinking and they don't necessarily reflect any unique individual perspective. Instead, it's as though someone collated the best  general thinking on these 20 topics and rolled them out into 72 brightly  designed and easy-to-read pages, studded along the way with boxed tips, color  shots of a multiracial cast of "coworkers" animatedly hashing through the  workplace issues of the day, and a self-test of one's skills in the topic at  hand on the last few pages of each volume. Again, they're not for anyone looking  for more in-depth or focused help on any of the subjects they cover, but they're  perfect as a quickie general-interest reference... and let's face it, they're so  cute and look so smart in a neat little stack or row that you'll probably want  to buy a whole bunch to give to your entire staff or department. <i>--Timothy  Murphy</i></span>

                    <span>Well, that is what someone in my life always says. <p>Leading is not always easy.  Being aware of problem solving and how to support the endeavors of others is very important. <p>In this tiny book you will find practical techniques that will show you how to use your initiative to inspire excellence. The clear text and illustrations cover most aspects of supporting, empowering and motivating staff. <p>Robert Heller has written many books and is the leading authority on management consultancy. He was the founding editor of Management t Today magazine and has supervised the launch of a number of successful business journals. <p>He seeks to make you a dynamic and inspirational leader. Power tips show you how to handle real-life situations and develop first-class leadership skills. Yellow numbered boxes include phrases such as: <p>"Take into account the feelings of staff when promoting internally."<p>"Actively seek the views of your team members." <p>Fun Do and Don't lists are also included. <p>Do: Do try to create a positive atmosphere, free from rigidity.<br>Don't: Don't ask people to do things that you wouldn't do yourself. <p>Chapters Include: <p>Learning to Lead: Focusing on quality, learning from others, gaining experience, mastering roles, developing strengths, assessing your leadership potential. <p>Leading Others: Preparing to lead, forming a team, exercising authority, delegating tasks, communicating clearly, dynamizing groups, collegiate leadership.<p>Improving Your Effectiveness: Making decisions, setting goals, developing a team, leading discussions, using meetings, analyzing problems, giving support, assessing your leadership skills. <p>Inspiring Excellence: Motivating others, establishing a vision, generating ideas, managing openly, boosting achievement, being adventurous.<p>A handy index "leads" you to topics of interest. A few case studies make the topics seem more down-to-earth and helpful. The "Giving Support" chapter was something you could use in any situation. People will bring their personal difficulties to a good leader and they may not even be work related. It is important to show sympathy. <p>"Trust can be difficult to build, but it is easy to lose."<br> <br>The aspect of a promise made is a promise kept is very important. Being loyal to your people, praising success and only criticizing in private will show others you are someone they can trust and that you have their best interests at heart. <p>Compact and essential!</span>
