                <span id="Label1">Acclaimed journalist Ted Conover sets a new standard for bold, in-depth reporting in this first-hand account of life inside the penal system.<br><br>When Conover&#8217;s request to shadow a recruit at the New York State Corrections Officer Academy was denied, he decided to apply for a job as a prison officer. So begins his odyssey at Sing Sing, once a model prison but now the state&#8217;s most troubled maximum-security facility. The result of his year there is this remarkable look at one of America&#8217;s most dangerous prisons, where drugs, gang wars, and sex are rampant, and where the line between violator and violated is often unclear. As sobering as it is suspenseful, <b>Newjack</b> is an indispensable contribution to the urgent debate about our country&#8217;s criminal justice system, and a consistently fascinating read.<br></span>

                    <span>Ted Conover's brilliantly insightful guide to a year in the life of a corrections officer at Sing Sing prison truly deserves the accolades it has received. I was curious as to what prison life is like as viewed from 'the other side', and, as Conover reveals, the officers are as much 'prisoners' (albeit of a different kind) as those they guard. The stress levels are revealed to be almost unbearable - C.O.s face the threat of violence every day - prisons are understaffed, and the high turn over rate, at Sing Sing in particular, means that inexperienced officers, otherwise known as 'newjacks' must make difficult decisions on the spur of the moment.<P>Conover's honesty is to be applauded - he is sympathetic to those officers who are truly just there to earn a living, and reserves his scorn for those sadistic officers who get a kick out of what has to be one of the worst jobs on the planet. Conover's sympathies also lie with certain prisoners - although his initital liberalism upon entering Sing Sing has most definitely been tempered by the end of his stint.<P>'Newjack' is a brilliantly written, thoroughly depressing and utterly essential book, that raises more questions than it answers - a truly thought-provoking work.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be extremely balanced and fair in its reporting, and at no time demonstrated any bias towards correction officers nor inmates.<P>First of all, Conover should be praised for his dedication to the subject matter. Not many journalists would subject themselves to correction officer boot camp AND a whole year of working at Sing Sing just to get a story. Was it wrong for him to have deceived the prison system that way? My only answer to that would be that in a democracy like ours, an institution that gobbles up so much of the taxpayers' money and yet insist on absolute secrecy as to their methods can only expect something like this happen sooner or later. The public has the right to know at least the general process and the results of that process.<P>I personally did not get a sense of Conover being on the side of the inmates. In fact, if that were the case I would have been extremely turned off, as I am one of those who believe that many prisoners are there as consequences of what THEY chose to do. Conover was very careful to be fair to both sides of the story. I finished the book with a much higher respect for correctional officers. I was enlightened as to the amount of danger, frustrations and abuse that they endure on a daily basis. In fact, after reading this book, I feel that correctional officers should get more than what they're currently paid! Why would certain officers object to this book? How did the author "betray" them? (Interestingly enough, some of the worst critics of this book are the individuals that weren't portrayed in the best light in the narrative.)<P>As far as the inmates go, Conover relates his experiences and conversations with several notable ones who have struck an impression on him. He doesn't, at any time, make excuses for them. In fact, I appreciated the fact that he admits in certain parts of the book about wanting to punch a few of those that were especially troublesome and annoying. (At one point, after an especially nerve-wrecking episode with the inmates, he also fantasized about the entire block burning up in flames.) This may sound disturbing to some of us, but I doubt that any of us WOULDN'T think these thoughts if we were placed in a similar situation. He doesn't try to appear to be the perfect, inscrutable officer, and is very much himself throughout the entire process. Telling the readers his true emotions added a lot to the narrative.<P>Conover has made a valuable contribution to the literature concerning our prisons. He doesn't claim to be writing about the entire system, nor its pros and cons, but merely about HIS experiences during a year at Sing Sing. In doing so, he has produced a highly convincing and readable piece of work that has more impact than one written about the system in general by an outsider who has only stepped into a prison for interviews. <P>Highly recommended for all!</span>

                    <span>I can't believe these guys (corrections officers) put up with the stuff they do. It takes nerves of steel to work in a place like that. The book was very entertaining. At times I could not put it down. Also recommended : Nine-o Adam, Another Day in Paradise, Junky, Slaughter House Five.</span>

                    <span>This book is awesome. I worked in the corrections field for three years, and reading the author's experiences at the training academy and then as he started work at Sing Sing brought back a lot of memories. Sing Sing sounds like a real hell on earth from the author's descriptions, and that applies to most prisons, places where hope doesn't exist. Very well written and very accurate portrayal of what correctional officers go through on a daily basis. Very highly recommended to anyone wondering what it's like to work in, or to be incarcerated in, a prison.</span>

                    <span>This book gives you a real insite as to not only what the inmates go thru but also what the officers and their families contend with on a daily bases. I think it is a great way to get an idea of what really happens behind bars.</span>
