                <span id="Label1"><P> By identifying the structure of DNA, the molecule of life, Francis Crick and James Watson revolutionized biochemistry and won themselves a Nobel Prize. At the time, Watson was only twenty-four, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science's greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions, and bitter rivalries. With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his and Crick's desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work.</span>

                    <span>The book is a first hand story from Watson, who along with Francis Cricks was the first to formulate the double helical structure of the gene. Watson writes candidly about the frustrations, setbacks, anguishes and the breakthroughs involved in the process of discovery. The intense rivalry between different labs, particularly between Cambridge (Watson & Cricks) and Pauling (in the US) is insightful. Key players at the time were acutely aware that whoever solved the puzzle would have a place in scientific history, and rightly so. Competition is perhaps a good thing, even in the sciences!
<br />
<br />Key observations / points from the Double Helix:
<br />i.	Watson's openness about the failures, progress, wrong turns, thought processes and other associated aspects of research.
<br />ii.	Cricks' incredible confidence (arrogance?) and commitment - he worked with Watson despite clear direction from Bragg (Sir Lawrence Bragg, the lab Director) to focus on his PhD.
<br />iii.	Open communication between smart people is critical to success. Scientific development seems to revolve around that. Why is business generally so poor at doing this - communicating?
<br />iv.	A combination of theoretical, experimental (x-ray / lithography) and model building (it is hard to think in 3d, but easy to see) was critical to the ultimate solution. Particularly the latter, model building. This reminded me of Richard Feynman's book (Surely You are Joking Mr Feynman) where he describes something very similar. Theoretical folks obtain insights from experiments and vice versa.
<br />v.	Hanging around smart and communicative people is a good thing and should be aspired to - something I am lacking at the moment.
<br />vi.	Watson learned fundamentally new fields (after some considerable reluctance) from scratch after discovering that he had to learn them.
<br />vii.	Intense rivalry between different labs for solving the gene structure first. 
<br />viii.	Watson's comments that it was much more satisfying to try and have a shot at glory by attempting to solve the gene structure than to never have risked a thought. Reminded me of other academic environments. Even if business people and / or academics adopted a very small part of the general principle that Watson and Cricks' did, they would be much more innovative. 
<br />ix.	Have fun. Watson and Cricks spent a lot of time travelling, eating out, drinking, chasing girls, attending parties - they seemed to be acutely aware of the fact that they (particulary Watson) would be labelled boring and thus strived to be interesting. Have (am?) i been guilty of that as well??
<br />x.	No ego. Watson, Cricks and most others in the community apprear to talk straight, admit to faults quickly, learn and progress.
<br />
<br />Overall, a candid first-hand account of the pursuit of the discovery of the `secret of life' - a must read.

                    </div>
                    <span>The discovery of the structure of DNA was a monumental leap forward for the world of science.  Whether or not you are looking to forward you studies in this area, I recommend opening this book.  Watson provides a vibrantly colorful description of the exciting race to find a solution.  A biography, the Double Helix adds a hint of humanism to a scientific search.  His writing is fresh and direct, without any hesitation to state what he feels.  Apart from being highly informative, it is an exciting retelling of the research process.  Upon reading the novel, however aware you are that Watson and Crick will be receiving Nobel Prize for their discovery, you are still caught up in the chase.
<br />	
<br />A discovery of such epic size could not have been achieved by two scientists alone.  Watson delves into descriptions of the scientists who provided essential pieces of information.  Over the course of the novel we are introduced to Maurice Wilkins, who would be awarded the Nobel Prize along side Watson and Crick in 1962.  Rosalind Franklin is depicted, giving her an undersized portion of recognition she deserved, as without her work with radiation Watson and Crick would have never gotten any where.
<br />
<br />It is fascinating to hear the overlooked aspects of what happens on the path to discovery.  When we are introduced to Watson he is an unfocused American graduate studying physics, who on account of sheer luck stumbles across bio chemistry and his future boastful partner Francis Crick.  
<br />
<br />In the Double Helix, Watson does more than merely recount the steps of his discovery.  Here, is a very human story about an important scientific endeavor.  You travel with Watson as he tastes wine and debates politics; a reminder that science is also a part of everyday life.  Therefore, it is a narrative that holds appeal for all people with all levels of interest in science.

Otherwise this book pretty much reads like a quick, interesting novel.  DNA would have been more interesting to learn in school, knowing the characters behind it's discovery.  So read it if you're learning about the meaning of life, DNA.</span>

<br />
<br />The Double Helix
<br />by: James D. Watson
<br />
<br />	The Double Helix is the tale of the ups and downs of an adventure shared by two men.  This novel depicts the struggle of James Watson and Francis Crick to discover the structure of DNA while attempting to simultaneously focus on other tasks at hand.  They yearn to make this discovery before rival biochemist Linus Pauling beats them to the punch to thus win the Nobel Prize, which is foreshadowed for whoever might secure this discovery.  Having previously put their search on the shelf for a while Watson and Crick return to the task of solving DNA when Linus Pauling becomes presumably close to solving it himself.  After much trial and error Watson finally comes to the idea of the double helix and base pairs which proves to be the correct structure for DNA.
<br />	Watson is able to effectively captivate the reader and create a bridge for the reader to cross, enabling him or her to delve in the Watson's world of science.  He is fully able to depict the complicated biochemistry that is present in his story in such a way that it is more easily comprehendible for his audience.  Watson is successful in vividly relaying the accounts of his story with plentiful detail that creates a tremendous picture in the mind of the reader.
<br />	On the other hand, constant reference to numerous scientists and other people is a cause of confusion for the reader as he or she tries desperately but usually ineffectively to recall which person was responsible for which action when they resurface at different times throughout the novel.  The inclusion by Watson of all these characters removes and scatters the focus of audience from where he intends it to be, which is on his struggle with DNA.
<br />	Despite this imperfection The Double Helix is still a great novel.  It does so much to further the understanding the discovery of the structure of DNA.  It is a great complimentary learning tool for anybody interested in biochemistry and DNA.

                    </div>
                    <span>The Double Helix by James D. Watson chronicles James Watson's and Francis Crick's etraordinary discovery of the structure of DNA. This book shows the not only the critical problems and solutions they found but also Watson's thoughts and perceptions of the people around him. Watson's views of his colleagues Sir Lawrence Bragg, Max Perutz and his competitors Linus Pauling, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins are harsh and biased yet they still provide some insight. An interesting look at the competition that takes place between the scientists is also present as Crick and Watson race to be the first to solve the DNA mystery. Watson's description of glee at Linus Pauling's failure to find the structure of DNA shatters the idea that all scientists have a noble drive which is to improve the world.
<br />
<br />This book begins with Watson's various travels and studies. Before arriving at Cambridge his main focus had been bacterial and viral phages. However, after arriving in Cambridge and meeting Francis Crick, their shared interest in solving the DNA myestery exploded, and their efforts that would eventually lead to success began. It is important to note that during their time of model building and researching, both Crick and Watson were really supposed to be working on other projects. Their discovery, which revolutionized science, was produced during their spare time. Watson clearly explains the thought processes he and Crick underwent while also providing an imporved understanding of DNA.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read. The Double Helix is short, informative, yet very entertaining. The language is easy to understand and all of the scientific topics are well explained. Watson's dry humor is spread throughout the book making it a very enjoyable read. </span>
