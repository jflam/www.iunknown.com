                    <span>Chinese language and culture differ so strongly from American thought and culture that it is impossible to think that a single translation of a classic Chinese text can give the reader the complete experience of having read the text in its original language and context.  RL Wing's translation brilliantly shines a light on the ART OF WAR.<p>I came to Wing's translation after having studied and studied the old public domain English translation with its copius notes and explanations.  Wing gives the reader a tremendous insight into THE ART OF WAR, the brevity and compactness of Chinese language expression, the morality and thinking of Sun Tzu, and the different ways that the Eastern mind comprehends war from the Western mind.<p>If you are a dedicated student of Sun Tzu's ART OF WAR, this translation belongs in your collection.  I don't know if it's the best or not,  but it's a vital translation.  If peace is your highest aim and the resolution of conflict without coming to violence is your highest aspiration, this book displays the wisdom of the great general in terms that clarify meaning for Western readers.</span>

                    <span>5 star for SunTzu's work<br>0 star for R.W.Wangs annotaion<br>3 stars over all<p>Sun Tzu's strategy is based on the laws of nature - both human and environment. His treatise is a universal template that shows the way to triumph over conflicts from interpersonal to international. The strategy follows a direct path that escalates until victory is assured.  From analysis and projection, through planning and positioning and on to confrontation.  Sun Tzu explains such techniques as the use of camouflage the creation of illusion and gathering intelligence.  A true victory can be won only with a strategy of tactical positioning so that the moment of triumph is effortless and destructive conflict is averted.  Sun Tzu pointed out "Those who win one hundred triumphs in one hundred conflicts do not have supreme skill. Those who have supreme skill use strategy to bend others without coming to conflict".<p>Sun Tzu explores the psychological motivations for power and discipline in `Art of War'. His work is ostensibly about tactics and day-to-day practice of warfare. As Sun Tzu was a keen observer of human nature, `the Art of war' is filled with advice useful not only for those engaged in war but also for those carrying on their normal lives.<p>The strategic and tactical doctrines expounded in `The Art of War' are based on deception, the creation of false appearance to mystify and delude the enemy; the indirect approach; readily adaptability to the enemy situation' flexible and co-ordinate maneuver of combat elements and speedy concentration against point of weakness. The best policy is to attack the enemy plans to prevent him from acting; then disrupt his alliances; creating a wedge amongst the people in state. <p>In the `Art of War' the underlying tone is discipline.  The general has to spend considerable amount of energy in emphasizing the need for discipline. Discipline via fear is however useful only up to a point. There must be a motivating force for all people who aspire to succeed, whether in the field of business, politics, administration, government or warfare. Wars cannot be won by just mere strength but it is on a conglomeration of factors, which need to be accounted. Sun Tzu emphasizes the need to take the moral of oneself and its enemy, the environment and other barriers into consideration. The moral strength and intellectual faculty of men were decisive in war, and that if these were applied war could be waged with certain success. Never to be undertaken thoughtlessly or recklessly, war was to be preceded by measures designed to make it easy to win.  The master conqueror frustrates his enemy plans and breaks his alliances; he creates cleavages between the sovereign and minister, superior and inferiors, commanders and subordinates.  His spies and agents are active everywhere, gathering information, sowing dissention and nurturing subversion. The enemy needs to be isolated and demoralized and his will to resist broken, thus without battle his army is conquered his cities taken and his state overthrown.<p>Sun Tzu is a very vigilant and keen observer on human psychology.<br> <br>The commentaries and annotations inserted preceding each chapter by R.W.Wang were lacking in depth; thought and any structure. They are more of an irritant than interesting read. I found myself skipping over his annotations. I found that his annotations had grammatical mistakes and I didn't find an introduction about the author.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book in its first edition when I was in my late twenties trying to climb the corporate ladder. I had just finished reading James Clavell's 'Shogun', was deep into the Akira manga and began dating a girl from Shinjuku. Needless to say I was a bit overboard on the whole Asian trip. But you remember the 80s, we were all thinking about the Pacific Rim. With that in mind, I took this book more seriously than the average reader might, but let me tell you something, it was profoundly impressive, and it worked.<p>The book is laid out in such a way that it makes a perfect blueprint for a year's worth of meditations. I rushed the process, but memorized each of the pages, and followed up with journal writings. A bit more extreme than the average bear, I confess but it made such a difference. Now, more than ten years later, what I have internalized from that period remains core. As I review the axioms, it's hard for me to imagine how I saw things before they became as self-evident to me as they are now. And yet I still find myself drawn to repeat the entire process as I embrace a new set of challenges at middle age.<p>I'm not the kind given to 12 step programs and all that, I make jokes about the person who asks for directions to the self-help section of the bookstore, but this is great stuff for the most hard headed pragmatists as well as the wooliest thumbsuckers. My recommendation to you is to take this book as a guide to meditations and study of the tao. The deeper you are into 'untenable' situations, the more profound the insights you will gain.</span>

                    <span>The title R.L. Wing has is far more representative of the content. It really is not all about "The Art of War", though it does address combat strategy. I find it is far more about success without ever having to come to blows. The commentary on the "four conflicts" is of interest as we appear to live in a society that only recognizes three of the four stated and denies the remaining one. From the other side of the world, a radically different time, a very different culture, and more than a thousand years ago he predicts the consequences. As he is dealing with human nature and behavior, the book is timeless in its commentary.<br>A Chinese national who I once worked with told me after reading this edition he thought it the best translation visually and in content he had seen to date.</span>

                    <span>B. H. Liddell Hart, the great British strategist, said late in his life that all his ideas could be found in Sun Tzu. Maybe so, but even a knowledgeable reader would struggle to see Sun Tzu's ideas in a modern context -- until this beautifully annotated version appeared. Sun Tzu argues persuasively that bold, indirect tactics, intended to disrupt the adversary's will and capacity to fight, are more effective than direct, often costly attacks. He is especially impressive in his treatment of the importance of terrain, intelligence and movement.<br>R. L. Wing goes beyond straight translation -- actually, some scholars claim his translation is not as good as some others -- to illustrate how each of Sun Tzu's principles can be applied to an individual's internal conflict, conflict with one's environment, conflict with close friends, and conflict in and among organizations. Even if you've read Sun Tzu before, this version is worth having and reading -- and re-reading.</span>
