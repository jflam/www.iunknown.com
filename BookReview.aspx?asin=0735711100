                    <span>I was kindly asked to read this book and act as a technical reviewer, and I must say that I am glad I did. The book is well written, and has a number of well thought out examples that for the most part demonstrate clearly some of the most complex issues facing Zope Content Managers and Site Designers.<P>Unfortunately, a few of the examples (And it is only a few) on some of the most important issues, most notably acquisition, contain glaring errors that could confuse and mislead new Zope users.<P>I say this is unfortunate, because the quality, and pitching of the book, including numerous URLs where more information, or freely downloadable add-on products can be found, is otherwise just about perfect.<P>Inspite of the problems I have mentioned, I would recomend that all new Zope users get this book, and work through the examples.</span>

                    <span>Zope is an exciting Web Application Server. It has the powerful scripting language<BR>in python; it is Open Source Software with strong commercial supports. In fact, the only<BR>thing users and developers often complain about is its deep learning curve, which is<BR>more or less about the lack of good documentation. <P>This book is an excellent sources for developers. It will jump<BR>start you with a set of essential zope knowledge and products covering serveral <BR>major areas of cutting-edge website architechture: <BR> events publishing (Calendar Tag),<BR> discussion tools and weblog ( ZWiki & Squashdot & CMF & ZUBB & Tracker),<BR> web mail (POPMail & IMapClient & ZmailIn ),<BR> searching ( ZCatalog )<BR> external access, <BR> user management and security<P>not only it covers in details of the above area and related products, but the<BR>authors did a fine job of making them so easy to follow and understands. Even some<BR>of the most difficult technologies are covered with easy: CMF Tools and ZPatterns,<BR>those two had given me days of headache before were finally making sense to me.<P>I have read another book before (The Zope Book by Amos and Michel of Zope fame). Both<BR>are excellent and they actually complement each other very well. If you have read those<BR>who complainted about The Zope Book's lack of practical contents (such as database access,<BR>setting up zope with apache etc.), those issues are all dealt in excellent details here<BR>in this book!<P>If you are one of those who have to deal with every aspect of web-related issues, such as<BR>server setup and administration, web architechture design and development, programmers <BR>and web content design, then this book is a must have!</span>

                    <span>This book is both outdated (it discusses extensively Zope extensions that are no longer supported) and incoherent (it is<BR>just a collection of unrelated example projects only loosely<BR>tied together by the common theme of managing some content on a<BR>web site). You're better off with the Zope Bible (for Zope) and the Content Management Bible (for CM issues generally). However,<BR>there are a few useful things in it so if you can get it for <BR>$5-10 as a remaindered book, go for it.</span>

                    <span>This book tries to cover slightly different ground than "how to start using Zope to develop web sites." If you're looking for a good general introduction to Zope, I'd look at either Beehive's The Book of Zope, or the Zope Book (the online edition at zope.org; the printed version is quite out-of-date).<P>This book is basically a walkthrough of several products for Zope (the CMF, ZPatterns, ZUBB, etc.) I doubt you'll find that you've learned much about how to use Zope or how to develop for it, rather than a thin bit about how to apply these products.<P>I also found that this book felt rather hastily put-together, without much continuity between chapters.<P>The only reason I'd recommend this book is if you're looking to learn about ZPatterns, and chances are, you aren't.</span>

                    <span>First there are lots of code snippets right in the text,<BR>which makes it rather easy to follow things when you don't<BR>have a Zope box next to you. Sometimes they are a bit too<BR>in-depth (like the listing of the SQLLevers in the ZPatterns<BR>example) but most time they are selected wisely.<P>I found a lot of different topics explained (from Zope<BR>for Newbiews, CMS, lots of 3rd Party Products, System Administration,<BR>ZEO) which all bring enough knowledge to you, to start working with <BR>them right after reading. (Or after downloading from the online<BR>website that comes with the book.)<P>The Chapter (actually there are 3) about ZPatterns is actually<BR>the most important to me, because it helped me understanding<BR>this complex topic in a couple of days.<P>This book is a big must-read for all people trying to gain "Zope-Zen"!</span>
