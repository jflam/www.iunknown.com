                <span id="Label1">For Visual Basic (VB) programmers seeking the Microsoft Certified Developer (MSCD) credential, <I>Distributed Applications for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit</I> provides a good resource for the material you'll likely face on the test, "Distributing and Implementing Distributed Applications with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0" (exam 70-175). This is a digestible book that doesn't overwhelm you with a lot of details, but it gives you what you need to build n-tiered distributed applications on the Microsoft platform with VB.<p> The strongest features of this text are its digestible introductory material and simple "lab exercises," centering on the major tools for creating distributed applications the Microsoft way. These examples include Visual Basic 6, including its modeling tools, as well as SQL Server 7 and Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS). Short, comprehensible exercises are the rule here, and there is plenty of advice on installing and running these tools. Later chapters concentrate on server-side processing with material on MTS, stored procedures, and security. There's also plenty of hands-on detail, with numerous screenshots for properly installing and administering your distributed solutions. <p> Because of its relative ease of presentation, readers may doubt that this book is all you need to master VB 6 certification. (It's certainly true that other exam guides seem to stress the <I>gotchas</I> on test questions.) Obviously, this Microsoft-sponsored book doesn't adopt a "beat the testmaker" approach; it instead stresses the basic skills and knowledge that its certification exam will test. There's little doubt that having this Microsoft textbook in your test preparation arsenal will raise your chances of getting certified with today's Visual Basic. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Microsoft Distributed interNet Architecture (DNA) overview, Visual Studio tools and SQL Server 7 basics, VB user interface controls, data validation, VB COM DLL components, business objects, modeling tools, ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), asynchronous database operations, stored procedures and T-SQL, MTS installation and programming how-to, security for Windows NT, SQL Server and MTS, DCOMCNFG, debugging, and error handling.</span>

                    <span>I have all the books in this series and give all the books 4 stars. Apart from the odd typo here and there, the books are well presented.<P>Exams 70-176 and 70-175 are relatively simple if you are a Visual C++ programmer who has only used Visual Basic as a test harness. The content of the Training Kits covers 80% of any exam (VC++ exams too) and was enough for me (just) pass them. If you also read the 'orange' books, you will get 100% for the VB exams.<P>'Desktop Applications for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit'<P>'Distributed Applications for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit'<P>'Programming Components With Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0'<P>'Programming Distributed Applications With COM and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0' books.</span>

                    <span>I can't say this is a bad book, but after passing my exam I must say that if I would have use this as my only resource I wouldn't have acomplished that goal.<P>This book could be enough only for VERY experienced developers using Visual Basic, and especially in distributed environments, who are already comfortable using MTS and working with SQL Server. But other people who know Visual Basic, feel they could get certified, BUT haven't got loads of experience, like myself, should get other books, I used MCSD in a Nutshell and believe me that book is awsome.<P>In a few words, if you've got money to spare, get this book is not so bad, but if you really need efficient study material, or good reference items, there are better sources around here.</span>

                    <span>The practice exam on the cd was terrible and some sections are a bit patchy. If you buy the equivalent book for 70-175 you'll find that about 60% of this book is duplicated in that book. However, this book was my only resource and I passed the exam with just over 780. I think I could have done much better had I bought transcender.</span>

                    <span>I used this book to pass the exam. I scored 957. I did get a few questions in the exam that were either not covered adequately or not at all in this book. But, I do feel that the book did provide a solid resource for the key parts of the exam, i.e. ADO, MTS, COM and n-tier technology. I would only recommend this book to people that have a fairly solid background in VB and want to pass the exam.</span>

                    <span>This book definitely covers almost everything that's on the exam.<BR>However, I must agree with most reviewers that you need more than this book to pass the exam. With practice exams, (I purchased ones from Transcender) if you read this book thoroughly, and understand the core concepts that this book tries to touch, then you won't have any problem passing this exam. (and this exam isn't that hard anyway!)<P>Good luck,</span>
