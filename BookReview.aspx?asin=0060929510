                <span id="Label1"><I>Modoc</I> is the joint biography of a man and an elephant born in a small German circus town on the same day in 1896. Bram was the son of an elephant trainer, Modoc the daughter of his prize performer. The boy and animal grew up devoted to each other. When the Wunderzircus was sold to an American, with no provision to take along the human staff, Bram stowed away on the ship to prevent being separated from his beloved Modoc. A shipwreck off the Indian coast and a sojourn with a maharajah were only the beginning of the pair's incredible adventures. They battled bandits, armed revolutionaries, cruel animal trainers, and greedy circus owners in their quest to stay together. They triumphed against the odds and thrilled American circus audiences with Modoc's dazzling solo performances, only to be torn apart with brutal suddenness, seemingly never to meet again. Hollywood animal trainer Ralph Helfer rescued Modoc from ill-treatment and learned her astonishing story when Bram rediscovered her at Helfer's company. His emotional retelling of this true-life adventure epic will make pulses race and bring tears to readers' eyes.  <I>--Wendy Smith</I></span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book. I must say, I love to read, but most of my books I read are about horses, I usually don't like other books. But this book reached into my heart and I will not soon forget it. The touching relationship between Bram and Modoc was so cool, and what was more incredible was that it is a true story. This book will make you cry, laugh, and don't be surprised if your heart swells with emotion. I highly recommend this book!</span>

                    <span>I normally dont like reading books at all. I always catch myself thinking about different things like whats going on in my life, and not remebering anything that i just read. When i read Modoc, i caught myself thinking about other things, however those other things were everything thats been going on in modoc's life other than my own.</span>

                    <span>This is truely one of the best books I have ever read. It is a touching and poignant story of the relationship between a boy/man and his elephant. No other story that I have read has captured the bond between human and animal as convincingly as this. Other reviewers are too hung up on the accuracy of the author's claim that the story is true. He clearly states at the beginning that there is a certain amount of "hearsay" and poetic license taken with the story. I could not put this book down. It hooked me from the beginning and didn't let go until long after I had read the book. This book begs to be made into a movie. Don't miss it.</span>

                    <span>Many reviewers have commented on the obvious non-factuality of Modoc -- the lack of tusks in the illustrations, the fact that the pictures seem to be of two elephants. To me, all seemed well until India hove into sight. I have been around India a lot. Most of what was written about it in Modoc seems vastly unlikely. Girl-boy relations in India are not like that. Refusal of a dowry would have been a massive insult. How come bandits and hill tribes all spoke English? And to a German! There was no "People's Liberation Army" in India before 1940. Biplanes with machine guns in India then? And on and on. Moving to the USA, I can't see, as a doctor myself, what insect poison could be produced in copious enough quantities to poison even one elephant, let alone dozens. And there would be no "vaccine" (actually, antidote) to any such agent. A highly romanced tale, at best. Like almost all reviewers, though, I found some good philosophy in the book, a natural wisdom, and a great insight into the relationship between humans and animals. When the author is in his elephant, sorry "element", namely animal training, then he seems truly authentic. Thanks for writing it, anyway, Ralph.</span>
