                    <span>This is one of those books you can't put down.  It was a moving tearful story with you both loving and hating the main character.
<br />I highly recommend this book especially to high school kids.
<br />It gives us a better understanding into middle eastern life years ago.  I recommended this to my granddaughter and this book is now on her English class's required reading list.  She is a Freshman.
<br />Give this one a try.  You will not be disappointed!</span>

                    <span>Hosseini portrays the agonizing battle of a tragically flawed main character who you both love and hate. To be honest, I really didn't think I would like this book, but it was the required Freshman reading for the University I work at, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I couldn't put it down!!!!</span>

                    <span>The story of The Kite Runner is quite remarkable in its tragedy, its history of Afghanistan, and the depths of love, sacrifice and forgiveness it portrays. It is told in the first person by Amir, who tells of his childhood growing up near Kabul, his adult life in America, and the act of redemption he must carry out to right a terrible wrong...perhaps more than one. The book is well written and flows nicely which makes it easy to read. The only time I set it down was when I needed a few minutes to digest what I'd just read or responsibility beckoned. Hosseini's characters are easy to like or dislike, as the case may be (I wondered as I read the book, if any of it was autobiographical).
<br />
<br />Hosseini includes many words and phrases in the Persian language of Farsi. Salaam, Khala Jamila, khastegari, naan, Topeh chasht are only a fraction of them (read the book to find out what they mean).  The reader learns why the color green is so important to Afghanis (notice how Hamid Karsi, Afghanistan's president, always wears green...the Afghan flag, etc.). We learn about the great, ancient tradition of kite flying and kite running, which is taken very seriously in Afghanistan.
<br />
<br />Afghanistan is a beautiful country when it's not being torn apart by invaders or internal battles among secular and/or religious factions. Amir sees it in all its beauty during his childhood, but returns to see it in ruins in mid-2001. The story begins in the winter of 1963 and ends in March 2002 (six months after September 11, 2001).
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book.

                    <span>I read this book after so many of my friends insisted it was the their best read this year.  What a disappointment.  The simplistic and shallow characters follow a horribly contrived plot with the seeming goal of manhandling your emotional state into one of forced sympathy for a protagonist you never liked anyway!  The narrator frequently mentions how bad it is to use cliches, but this book is chock full of them.  Don't feel bad about skipping this one.  </span>
