                    <span>I really appreciate any good book on organization. I would like to thank the author for her great advice on how to divide and conquer your "action" papers. This book is a nice complement to "File, Don't Pile" which gives much more detail on how to organize your other paper mess which is your reference files. I recommend both.</span>

                    <span>I would have rated this book higher if it had been the first book I read about organization. However, I purchased 5 at the same time while on a work space organizational kick. I read Organizing Your Workspace by Odette Pollar first as it states it's a quick read. Paper Tiger gave the same basic organization structure as Pollar's book, but with a more interesting and real tone than Pollar. However, Paper Tiger spent the second half of the book on the big picture of organizational organization, the home office, computer files, and long term maintenance of the filing system. Things I'm not interested in right now that I am in the overwhelming start of a new organizational process. This info may be helpful to me in a few months when I have established a routine and can concentrate on long term maintenance. I would have found more practical time saver tips and starting advise a better help.</span>

                    <span>I first borrowed this book from the library then went out an bought it for future reference. I was already using many of the processes explained but it has reinforced what I was doing and aided in clearing out the last of the paper mess in my life.</span>

                    <span>Months ago I saw the author on a morning talk show. I already own so many books on organization and clutter reduction, I thought what good would another book on the subject do me? Recently, after spending hours going through piles of paper that had been on the dining room table for weeks, and ending up with half of the papers in smaller piles, I ordered this book. I also ordered "Taming the Paper Tiger at Work" for my husband who is also "organizationally challenged". These books are quick reads, motivating, and the method the author lays out for managing all the paper in our lives is practical and easy. My husband took his book to work and spent the next two days revamping his files and was excited about it. My dining room table has been paper free for two weeks, and I know where to find info if I need, and what "papers" need to filled out, or phone calls made. Not only is my house tidier with less papers laying around, I feel less anxious that I am "forgetting" something.</span>
