                    <span>I enjoyed 'The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People' and was happy to see 'Daily Reflections' be released. I would recommend reading the seven habits first before getting this book. Working through a book daily fits my lifestyle and helps me actually implement the 'Habits' myself. Another helpful book was Rat Race Relaxer: Your Potential & The Maze of Life by JoAnna Carey, it also was set up in easy to read and implement chapters.</span>

                    <span>In this followup up to the original book by a similar title, Dr. Covey provides insight on how to work the plan. Each day has an inspiring excerpt that is easily grasped. Consider, for example, the December 5 entry where he reminds us of the need for continual rewewal. He writes: "Habit 7: 'Sharpen the Saw' is personal Production Capability. It's preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have--you. It's renewing the four dimensions of your nature--physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional."<P>That is the purpose of this book, in essence. It is to remind us of the need to be continually renewed and refreshed. This book is designed to do that mentally. I find it inspiring.</span>

                    <span>First, the reviewer from Falls Church, VA makes the statement that Covey makes reference to pages in The 7 habits.... If the person read the sub-title "Living the seven habits" one would expect Covey to refer to his other book. <P>This book is an excellent guide to to use for your daily life. Yes, it takes time but it is worth it. It is written to support the information from the 7 Habits. Read the 7H first and then use this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>In response to another's review, I must rise to Covey's defense. Covey seems well aware of the "mind-numbing" avalanche of tasks and things to do that people have to deal with. Seven Habits stuff is a direct response to that. It offers a good method for really thinking about what's important to you and making time for things that really matter -- WITHOUT the "numbing." I feel the buzzwords and catch phrases are designed to make a complex approach more accessible. I really think it's unfair to ascribe evil intentions to the offer of free items. Covey repeatedly states in his books that any organizer or planner can be adapted to his philosophy, but his stuff costs about the same as any other and if you are interested in using his approach it is way handier than putting adapting another system. This particular book is just OK. If you have the planner, or the original book which is a much better purchase, I don't see the need for this.<P>That said, there is a lot of marketing around 7H stuff which I don't have any use for. Despitew this, if you're bitter and angry I don't suppose any self-help book will work for you.</span>
