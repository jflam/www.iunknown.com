                <span id="Label1">It's important for anyone who creates Web sites--even those who rely on powerful editors like Dreamweaver or GoLive--to know HTML. The World Wide Web Consortium rewrote HTML as a subset of XML (dubbing it "XHTML 1.0") and the allowable code will eventually be stricter. Tags that are being phased out are labeled "deprecated"--current browsers can still handle them, but if you want your site to keep up with future browsers, not to mention conform to accessibility requirements, you will want to get on top of XHTML.<p>Of course, Elizabeth Castro manages to write books that not only speak to those who are already fluent in HTML, but are good for newbies too. She makes it a breeze to create sites that are visually stylish and technically sophisticated without the expense of buying an editor.<p>Among the topics covered in her new book, <I>HTML for the World Wide Web with XHTML and CSS</I>: using the (relatively newer) structural tags (like doctype and div); correctly using older tags (like p and img) that have been modified in XHTML; writing XHTML so that formatting is done by the style sheets; writing those style sheets (cascading style sheets, a.k.a. "CSS"); creating a variety of layouts; and dealing with tables, frames, forms, multimedia, a bit of JavaScript (including mouseovers), WML (for mobile device displays), debugging, publishing, and publicizing your site.<p>As with all Visual QuickStart Guides, this one features clear and concise instructions  side by side with well-captioned illustrations and screen shots that show both the source code and the resulting effect on the Web page. The index is extremely detailed, making this a great reference.<p>Also great for reference are the outstanding appendices. The first is an extensive list of tags and attributes, indicating which are deprecated and/or proprietary and on which page they are discussed. A similar appendix shows CSS properties and values; given the future of Web coding, this chart alone is worth the price of the book. Other handy charts cover intrinsic events, symbols and character Unicodes, and an expanded color chart that goes way beyond the virtually archaic  Web-safe palette. All of which makes this a definite must-have for every Web designer's bookshelf.  <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    <span>I have seen too many HTML guides that are page after page of straight text with few illustrations and no examples. Now these are fine if you're just interested in theory, but what if you want something to get you started coding HTML?<P>At the recommendation of a friend I purchased this book. Within a few weeks of using this book, I felt very comfortable coding and editing HTML WITHOUT any kind of WYSIWYG editor (Frontpage, Composer). I started creating all my HTML pages using notepad or wordpad. I figured out how to do some simple style sheets, tables, text editing, all kinds of links, images, etc.<P>The book is set up like this: First it's organized into chapters by topic. Each chapter contains a number of new things to learn. Each section, such as "Using Background Color (page 98)" contains a short intro paragraph (usually no more than a few sentences), step by step written instructions, tips, plus two illustrations, one of the code and one of the output of that code. The book also contains a very thorough index, color chart, html tag list, and compatibility guide.<P>If you want to learn the basics of HTML this book is just the thing. It will take you through the whole process from planning, through design and building your site, to publishing it.</span>

                    <span>I've been doing some HTML coding over the past five years and recently delved into learning HTML 4.01, XHTML, CSS, and some of the other newer technologies. After reading some more technical books, I looked at this one to see why it's so popular. It's easy to see why. All the basics of HTML and related technologies such as graphics, multimedia, and CSS are explained very simply with tons of examples HTML code and screenshots of browsers.<P>Now for the downside of the book: it's fairly short but covers a lot of topics. This means there is very little depth to the discussion, and lots of details are left out. If you're just getting started with HTML, that's probably appropriate. But after you digest a good chunk of this book, you'll want to get a meatier HTML or web design book and go back and fill in the missing pieces.<P>One more nit about this book: in my years of dealing with HTML, I've too often run across an HTML page that worked great in some browsers, but failed miserably on another. These failures included crashing the browser and printing thousands of pages to the printer! In every case, simply validating the HTML with the W3C validator would have picked up the problem right away. This book does mention using the validator, but only after you've noticed a problem. Take my advice: after getting each HTML page to look good in one browser, validate it! You'll save yourself and others lots of trouble.</span>

                    <span>I was just asked what was the most interesting tech-related book I've read in the last year and I had to say it was the 5th edition of Elizabeth Castro's Visual QuickStart Guide to HTML. It might not seem inspiring in and of itself, but it's so good I have a copy at home and at work always within arm's reach of my keyboard. It's brilliantly designed (the format of the Visual Quickstart Guides is excellent), extensively indexed, succinct, readable, reliable about warning of browser quirks and incompatibilities, and best of all, so far as I have seen in the 5th edition, error-free. <P>Sometimes simple usability and reliability is better than all the flashy stuff in the world, especially when it makes it easy for you to understand and apply the really huge potential of XHTML and CSS. I recommend it to anyone who writes HTML, particularly those making the transition from HTML 4.0 to XHTML and those learning CSS. What's best about it? You can pick it up, get the answer you need and get on with your web design fast. If you're getting a reference book everything rests on your ability to find the answer and quickly undestand the answer so you can apply it. This book is a stellar example of just that principle.<P>For those just learning HTML and CSS you may wish to also use another more wordy guide to get you started, but I suspect this is the one you'll still be using (and continually buying the new edition of) years down the road.</span>

                    <span>Let's face it, HTML isn't exactly rocket science. And this book gave it exactly the treatment it deserves: clear, easy to understand examples that show you what to do and what the results will be. If you are looking for a handy reference that won't break the bank or the bookshelf, this is the one. The coverage of CSS and XHTML standards was excellent, allowing me to go from absolutely no knowledge of CSS to writing my websites using style sheets rather than old-school formatting. If you are into the old-school stuff, it's in there for you, as well as a chapter on WML, for all you early adopters out there. <BR>My only complaint is that sometimes in the CSS chapters it was hard to tell if the code snippets were coming from the style sheet or from the HTML document, but once I got the hang of it that all made more sense. On the whole I would definitely reccomend this book to any beginner or intermediate programmer who wants to learn clean, standards-based (X)HTML.</span>
