                    <span>Hurray!  Hurray!  This 416 pager contains some of Kalb's finest comprehensive analysis on who he feels are the NBA's All-time greatest superstars.  It's a powerful mix of narrative & stats to perhaps once & for all prove to the entire world who are and more importantly WHY they are selected as pro basketball's 50 legends.  In terms of comprehensiveness -- not that such is required in a book of this type or any type but...?-- the fact that the author chose to focus only on the Top 50 instead of say the Top 100 is a mere crochet of taste, and that surely will sit well with most readers of the work.  Nevertheless Kalb really knows his NBA basketball and his expertise pounds and blasts home in each of the 50 entries with an overall insight of analysis colossally keen, honest and pure. This reviewer could not seize or sense anything at all fallacious(false) here; furthermore, there's seems to be very little author subjectivity in this book -- usually difficult in a "Who's Better, Who's Best..." type offering. Personally, this reviewer would have preferred 100 players instead of 50 only because 100 seems more of a definitive assessment. That or else to compile a 400 pager on JUST the Top 10 of All-time(once selected)-- now that would be a fun, satisfying, insightful hoops read.  But what's contained in WB,WB in BBL... is a very enjoyble & edifying read: it works both as a primer for the uninitiated NBA historian as well as a pungent and forceful critique and overall "Yes, HE is without question THE Number One Player of All Time and here's all the proof you need to prove it" Answer for those who simply must know who is #1 and why as assessed by a remarkably gifted & acutely sensitive NBA sports writer -- all with cogent and rational logic to back the choices up yet sans the subjective hubris a basketball writer the caliber of Kalb could've very easily've offered here.</span>

                    <span>Anyone who puts the brutish, relatively poorly skilled Shaq at the top of the list is missing more than half of his brains. Kalb, a stat geek, makes the cardinal sin of doing what should never be done: comparing players of different eras. It cannot be done. Example, he compares Bird vs. Erving based on a 1981 playoff matchup. At the time, Bird was approaching his prime, while Erving was already well past his. That's the kind of slippery thinking that is found throughout this book. <p>In the end, this is just one guy's subjective take, certain to anger scores of NBA fans and basketball historians.</span>

                    <span>Very nicely written, and I agree with your assessment of Shaquille O'Neal and Wilt. I would have flopped Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, but it's a minor quibble. I really enjoyed the last chapter, when the author discussed who had to leave out, and why. He made excellent points.</span>

                    <span>Man, it was refreshing to see Shaq get his props.  But more than that, listen to the man--this book has got some great arguments and brings up games and playoff series that bring you back to what you were feeling when those games were being played.  Did anyone see the All Star Game?  Kalb had the star of stars pegged! If the Lakers win it this year; it's because of the big guy.  He is the difference in the entire league.  But, back to the book.  This guy is obviously a Celtics fan.  He puts Cousy ahead of West???  DeBusschere isn't even in the top 50?  Bird ahead of Magic?  But you know--I'd love to debate him on those and other issues.  He's like some guy you meet in a bar, and want to talk sports with all night.  Buy the book, and see for yourself.  This is a must-read.</span>

                    <span>It seems every year there is another writer pointing out his opinions on why certain players are better than others. It seems that the authors of these books try to prove how much they know by putting someone ahead of Michael Jordan. But in this process, they all end up proving how shallow their true knowledge about the game really is. If you really intellectualized the argument, you'd only prove why Jordan will never be surpassed. It's silly to even discuss this issue because Jordan isn't just considered the greatest basketball player ever; he's widely considered the greatest athlete of the century. I'm going to destroy Mr. Kalb's weak book here so prepare yourself.<p>As a statistician, Mr. Kalb cherry-picks stats to bolster his arguments. Shaq, Wilt and MJ are the top 3. Of course anyone can cherry-pick stats to prove almost anything but what is funny is how even cherry-picking Shaq against Jordan still shows Jordan's superiority statistically. Of course, it doesn't matter because Kalb just gets defensive about it. Stats are also just one part of the story but that's all he goes on here and it makes for a weak argument and discredits his entire book. But the need to cherry-pick is there because if you took all the stats, the only two people to talk about are MJ and Wilt.<p>But what truly makes this book weak is that his approach doesn't prove to me that he really watches games or understands them. One thing I hate are people who just read the stats to prove who's better. But it's exponentially idiotic to use only offensive stats while rarely mentioning defensive stats. Coaches will most often point out that what truly set Jordan above everyone else was that he played defense even more seriously than offense. He knew everyone's weaknesses and tendencies and every team's offense concepts. If anyone really knows Shaq, he tends to lose interest on defense and that's a big weakness. Combine that with his atrocious free-throw shooting (like Wilt) and you have a #1 and #2 player with certain skills that are worse than mine. If I were about to perform violin scales better than Joshua Bell, there would be something seriously wrong.<p>Of course Wilt is another story which deserves a whole separate review. One of the best arguments against Wilt is that he fell off dramatically after his early thirties. Centers are the best at keeping their stats steady as they age because they always remaine bigger than everyone physically. But, the focus is going to on Shaq since he's wrongfully placed ahead of Wilt AND Jordan.<p>And of course there are the intangibles. We all know Shaq and Wilt dominate mostly with size so they don't need certain skills like a game past 15 feet. But does that really make a player better? And, we all know Jordan had the greatest work ethic with mental toughness and knowledge of the game with the most spectacular, asthetic moves but can you point that out in his Points Per Game which is still #1 no matter how you cherry-pick it?<p>Maybe we can revisit what Jordan did to Shaq. Does Kalb remember Jordan scoring 64 on Shaq when he first visited the Bulls? Does Kalb remember the Bulls sweeping a full-strength Shaq and Penny Magic team the first full year of his comeback? If I recall, the only success Shaq had against Jordan was when the Magic beat the Bulls after Jordan returned from baseball and played a rusty 19 games before the playoffs. Of course Kalb doesn't remember these things since he has no long term memory.<p>Kalb puts Kobe Bryant at #17 which is odd. Kobe's case is tough because obviously he's superior in skill to Shaq but his success is due to Shaq as well. Aside from copying MJ's mannerisms and being somewhat successful in trying to copy his moves, Kobe still has a lot to prove since has doesn't have any personal awards (no scoring title, defensive title, MVP, nor Finals MVP). If you really had the #1 and #17 players of all time together, shouldn't that diminish their positions because of each other's help? There's no mention of that. The thing is, Shaq, Wilt and Kobe being ranked so high smells of a Laker bias.<p>Each player gets 3-4 pages of the weakest arguments which makes the book a pointless read. If you really want a good argument, try "The Biographical History of Basketball". There is a chapter in the end which compares Oscar to MJ as the greatest. It's the best I've ever read on the issue but it's still not going to convince anyone to put MJ aside. But since that book has come out, Oscar has proven to me that he really was MJ without the flash and asthetic appeal. Watching old games shows that he truly knew the other team's weaknesses and concepts and played to exploit them. He was constantly learning. Shaq is not a very intelligent player for that matter and that is another glaring weakness. You just can't put a player with so many weakness on top. It's such an insult to players AND fans. That is why the best answer will always be MJ. He's Oscar with the impossible moves, nerves of steel, stats, titles, defense, athletic superiority, skill superiority, durability, and everything else. Who are we to argue against Phil Jackson, Tex Winter, Bobby Knight, Doug Collins and every player who actually played with, coached or watched the man? Of course you will always have 0.01 percent of this world ignoring blatant facts due to stubborn personal preferences, rebellious need or delusional beliefs but if these people really wanted to start to change the anyone's mind on things, they would have to come up with a much better book than this one. But really, there just isn't much room for serious debate here right now so there's no need to write anything.</span>
