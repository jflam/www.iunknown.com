                    <span>This book was an absolute hell to contend with.  I've taken two courses in Graph Theory, using Robin J. Wilson's Introduction to Graph Theory and this cheap broadsheet, respectively.  Wilson's book is the one to use!  It's extremely well-written, even fun to read--the reviews on Amazon will bear that out.<p>In the second graph theory course that I took (to refresh and refine my understanding), the professor chose the Schaum text solely for its low cost--he thought he was doing the students a service.  Hardly.<p>No thought whatsoever has been put into the readability of this book.  The tiny dark-grey font on light-grey paper is a simple enough design flub that makes reading past even two or three pages at a time almost unbearable.  Defining terms is seen as a chore to be compacted--a single page at the beginning of each chapter might try to define 10-15 terms, just to get them out of the way.  It becomes a mess of bold print that the reader is forced to continually return to because the definitions come with no context nor examples by which to remember them.  In the end, the reader realizes that 2/3 of the book is just list after list of badly-worded questions following under-scripted lessons.  <p>Look, it's not even worth writing any more about, the text frustrates me so much.  There's only two other reviews on this page, and I'd place money on them being written by the author himself.  Save yourself the $$$ and the hassle, and just go buy Wilson's book.  Trust me.</span>

                    <span>In general, the book not requires study in advance, but it is better for reference. I'm a software engineer and the book's treatment of "Shortest Path" and "Connectivity" problems is very usefull. Good for fast remember of the subject.</span>

                    <span>In this book one can find a practical survey of both principles and practice of graph theory, with great coverage of the subject. The outhor provides a lots of solved problems, with losts of theory proofs and all  with great clarity and common reasoning. The outhor gets you enter the  subject step by step from the easy problems to the hardest with great  skill. Also the algorithms on graphs presented in this book, and in general  the algorithmic approach of this book are presented most clearly. You  wouldn't leave this book until you'l finish read it and understand graph  theory. Finally you would fill that at least on one branch of mathematics  you are well sitted.</span>
