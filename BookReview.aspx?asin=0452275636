                <span id="Label1">The Iranians explores Iran in the context of its old and complex culture, for throughout its history Iran has struggled with two warring identities-one evolving from the values, social organization, and arts of ancient Persia, the other from Islam. By examining the  relationship between these two identities, The Iranians explains how the revolution of 1979 came about, why the Islamic Republic has failed, and how Iran today is on the brink of chaos. In this defining portrait of a troubled nation and the forces that shape it, Iranian history and religion become accessible to the nonspecialist. Combining impeccable scholarship with the human insight of firsthand observations, The Iranians provides vital understanding of this unique and pivotal nation.  <br>&#149; Plume edition will contain a new epilogue by Sandra Mackey, reflecting on the results of the spring 1997 Iranian elections. <br>&#149; Hardcover edition received enormous press coverage and increased Mackey's already prominent visibility. <br>&#149; Highly readable and aimed at the nonspecialist. </span>

                    <span>MacKey does a very good job of presenting the 3,000-year Iranian history in a readable form while searching for common themes in it. What she finds is a people with an inexhaustable passion for justice--linking the Zoroastarian revolutionary priests Mani and Mazdak with their Muslim heirs, Kashani and Khomeini; linking absolute monarchs ("shahanshahs" or king of kings) Cyrus with Shah Abbas and Reza Shah. Given the fact that Iran's struggle to reconcile its Islamic and Persian heritage are very much alive today, this book could very well join Mottahedeh's THE MANTLE OF THE PROPHET as the best-written text on post-revolutionary Iran, to be read by the students of history and State Department policy makers alike.</span>

                    <span>Mackey has written an excellent book in terms of historical facts and detailed accounts of Iran's past. However, her analysis and commentary on Iranian identity leaves much to be desired. She attempts to provide a modern perspective of Iran through discussing its long past, yet it seems to me that Mackey seems bent on forming an all-inclusive idea of what being "Iranian" is. That simply is not possible. Given the long history, incredible diversity, and complexity of the subject (which the author notes), the only way that one could present formula of "Iranianism" is by making many generalizations, which abound in this book. How else could one fit some 2500 years of history into 400 or so pages? All in all, it is a great introduction to Iran and a well-written, engaging book. My advice to readers: take Mackey's conclusions about why Iranians are the way they are with a grain of salt; this is not an academic book but rather, popular reading.</span>

                    <span>Ma'am, I am not given to writing book reviews professionally BUT as a practising, born and bred Zoroastrian, I feel compelled to say that our ethical triad rests on Good Thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds - in that order. Perhaps a typo makes you state Good Works which would equal Good Deeds. Also some not very au fait with Zoroastrianism are often found to place Good Words before Good Thoughts - a slight impossibility, don't you think?<P>For further assistance with the not too obvious, please feel free to write to me privately at my email address - I should love to learn more about you too!<P>Thanks for a patient read,<BR>Shirin J. Mistry.</span>

                    <span>I read the book when it came out in hard bound, and then again referred to it again recently in my college course work. It is a very insightful and excellent history of Iran. Although I am not Persian I did share parts of the book with Persian friends. Some had their own personal opinions on the matter, however, after reading it, I felt that Sandra Mackey gave a very good perspective. She does add some of her own personal interest and flavor, but I do not think it takes away from factual evidence. <P>Be prepared, it is a long book. It was a bit tough at the beginning to get going for me, but once I was into it, it was at times a page turner, and very good.<P>I would highly recommend this book. Anyone with an interest in the story of Iran, be it you are from the era of the Revolution (such as myself) or you are studying Middle East History (like myself) ** Keep in mind most Persians hate being referred to as Middle Easterners and as author and great lecturer Edward Said would say, that is a derogatory term. Anyway, if you find the region of interest, this book is a must read. Very well done, and one of the more detailed and interesting books I have read on Iran and the Persian History.</span>

                    <span>this book is okay for a beginners intro to iran but it misconstrues completely some of the facts of iranian history. mossdaegh did NOT assume dicatatorial powers, and at times it seems that ms mackey feels sympathy for the shah. the crimes of SAVAK, the shah's secret police, arent well documented either. dont waste your money- I recommend THE LAST GREAT REVOLUTION by Robin wright or PERSIAN MIRRORS by Elaine Sciolino</span>
