                    <span>I actually read most of the first edition of this book and upgraded to this book to stay current. It has two critical flaws:
<br />
<br />1) It lacks any "New in 2.0" labels. Given the scope and mass of the book, having to reread the whole thing to find the deltas between versions 1 and 2 is criminal.
<br />
<br />2) Horrible, horrible usability.
<br />
<br />If you didn't read the first edition, then the content is worth overcoming the hurdles. If you own the first edition, you're better off keeping it, and finding some other book to highlight what changed in version 2.0.</span>

                    <span>The buyrer should be aware the XSLT 2.0 runs only on the authors parser. However, this book is the one to buy. Each chapter/command starts with "Whats new in 2.0" so you get two in one. I had no previous XSLT knowledge and this book is a complete refernce, with carefully chosen examples. Its the book  every serious XML programmer should have.</span>

                    <span>C'mon, if you can't lookup information in a reference book, then it is not a reference.  Thus, it is not any good.  Don't give something 3 stars if it is a failure!
<br />This book is practically unusable as a reference book.  Its predecessor, covering version 1.0, has great page labels and CAN be used as a reference.  Of course, the index still stinks and thus it deserves your 3 stars.
<br />I bought this book expecting the same page labelling as the 1.0 reference.  It is criminal how poorly labelled the pages of this 2.0 book are.
<br />Also, this 2.0 book requires the XPATH 2.0 book, also called a "reference" book and fails similarly.
<br />Basically, do not buy Kay's 2.0 books.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>As with the previous editions, Michael Kay has written a book whose content is of the highest quality. Being the editor of the W3C XSLT and XPath recommendations and the developer of one of the only XSLT 2.0 implementations in town makes Kay the ultimate authority on XSLT. He also writes in a style that is accessible to developers of almost any level (although this is not ideal as a beginner's book).
<br />
<br />My big beef with the book is likely not Kay's fault. Being an author myself, I know how stubborn and pig headed publishers can be about their "style guidelines". Well, Wrox, your guidelines stink because this book is virtually impossible to use as a reference. Your font usage makes information impossibly hard to find by flipping pages. Your use of page headings is lame and unhelpful to the developer needing to find info fast.  
<br />
<br />In the end I have to recommend this book to XSLT 1.0 developers that need to get up to speed fast on XSLT 2.0 but it is too bad most of the profits are going to Wrox and not Kay.
