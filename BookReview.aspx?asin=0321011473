                <span id="Label1">Influence: Science and Practice is an examination of the psychology of compliance (i.e. uncovering which factors cause a person to say &#147;yes&#148; to another's request).  <P>Written in a narrative style combined with scholarly research, Cialdini combines evidence from experimental work with the techniques and strategies he gathered while working as a salesperson, fundraiser, advertiser, and in other positions inside organizations that commonly use compliance tactics to get us to say &#147;yes.&#148; Widely used in classes, as well as sold to people operating successfully in the business world, the eagerly awaited revision of Influence reminds the reader of the power of persuasion.  <P>Cialdini organizes compliance techniques into six categories based on psychological principles that direct human behavior: reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity.</span>

                    <span>Here's a recipe for an enjoyable and useful book. Begin with one respected professor of psychology from Arizona State University. Sweeten with Regents Chair and Distinguished Graduate Research Faculty distinction. Mix in comments from readers of previous editions ("we get mail"). Fold in pop psychology twist and plenty of examples. Season to taste with just enough irreverence to spice up the text. Bake with three previous editions, improving on each version. Absorb and chill for 262 pages and gain a deep, fun, yet realistic understanding of how humans influence each other.<P>Marketers will benefit tremendously from this book. So will executives, managers, business owners, students, and everyone who has an interest in how we are influenced to make decisions. Those decisions may affect what we buy, where we work and live, and what relationships we have with others. The illustrations sprinkled throughout the volume offset the small print used to cram a tremendous amount of content into a book that is small enough not to be intimidating. No wonder over a quarter million copies have been sold. It's an Everyman's book on the topic, yet it's an academic treatise as well, with 16 pages of references preceding the index. <P>Each chapter includes a summary and study questions-both on content and to stimulate critical thinking. All those features you'd want in a book like this are all there, waiting for you. Expect to curl up with this book, nod your head, laugh, shake your head, and wonder in amazement while gaining insight. Cialdini grabs your attention and won't let go. Expect to make notes, write in margins, underline or highlight, and repeat your reading. <P>Readers of "Influence" will look differently at the world around them. Even if you merely scan through this book, you'll gain a new appreciation for advertising, group behavior, and even how you're treated by salespeople, co-workers, bosses, parents and friends. The conscious and unconscious heightened awareness will be well worth the time and money you invest in this book.</span>

                    <span>Robert B. Cialdini concisely explores six strategies that persons with good and/or bad intentions can use in influencing others to do something or not to do it. These strategies are authority, commitment and consistency, liking, reciprocation, scarcity, and social proof. Cialdini convincingly demonstrates the power of each strategy with examples belonging to a wide range of disciplines. These stratagems often work because the target audience has been preprogrammed to react to specific situations in a certain way. Cialdini clearly explains which counter-strategies the target audience can use in defeating the six strategies mentioned above, whenever appropriate. To his credit, Cialdini refrains from using jargon that makes "Influence Science and Practice" a very enjoyable read that is easily accessible to a wide audience. As a side note, in "Simplicity Marketing", Steven M. Cristol and Peter Sealey explore the increasing need for shortcuts that businesses and consumers in the most developed economies have in making choices. Cristol and Sealey show with panache that marketers can use four strategies called the 4 R's -- Replace, Repackage, Reposition, and Replenish -- to simplify the life of businesses and consumers who are overwhelmed with choices in an increasing number of product categories.</span>

                    <span>The author doesn't like to be manipulated by telemarketers or salespeople, and yet who reads his book? Who do you think bot those 250,000 copies? Somebody trying to figure out how to manipulate you. According to Cialdini, marks respond to specific cues and tactics like an automatic door: wave your hand and beep, whirr. Click a switch and they'll be doing your bidding. There's an implicit anthropology: human beings don't know what they want until they get nudged in one direction or another, and then the prefenence for consistency and commitment takes over. Cialdini offers his own armchair rationalizations, that consistency is an evolutionary adaptation. But as a scientist, Cialdini should know that his hypothesis is not falsifiable. Pointing to evolution is just a form of hand waving? After all, what is the evolutionary advantage of irrational consistency? It's just as probable the other way.</span>

                    <span>Many reviews have previously highlighted the value of this book in everyday life situations. I limit my comments to technical professional life.<BR>I am a technical professional who has to work with practicioners of other technical disciplines. The reason I came across this book because I wanted to learn how I can influence other technical professionals to take my point of view into account in their work. After reading this book I recognize why some of my colleagues have much stronger influence than others. It is not because they are technically more competent or offer a better solution. They practise the influence techniques discussed in Cialdini's book.</span>

                    <span>This is a fantastic book on how to understand human psichology.<BR>Not only it is fun to read with a lot of cases and real-life examples, but it is also very well documented (references and bibliography) and based on hundreds of published scientific studies.<P>If you want to know how "mechanically" we react to things without "thinking" about them; you want to understand why humans can only function in a hierarchical system (wether military, political or social system), then this book will bring you some insights about it.<BR>You can see why Communism is not applicable to humans, why we are sold things we don't want to, why we react in a pre-determined way to basic situations (that override the reasoning and "thinking" processes). <BR>All other reviews of this book talk about the ways you can use (or that someone can use in you) to force someone to buy things they don't want to. I think this book goes way beyond that... Psichology and Sociology students can get quite of good insights from this book also.</span>
