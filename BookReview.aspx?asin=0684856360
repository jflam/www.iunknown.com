                <span id="Label1">Seth Godin, one of the world's foremost online promoters, offers his best advice for advertising in <I>Permission Marketing</I>. Godin argues that businesses can no longer rely solely on traditional forms of "interruption advertising" in magazines, mailings, or radio and television commercials. He writes that today consumers are bombarded by marketing messages almost everywhere they go. If you want to grab someone's attention, you first need to get his or her permission with some kind of bait--a free sample, a big discount, a contest, an 800 number, or even just an opinion survey. Once a customer volunteers his or her time, you're on your way to establishing a long-term relationship and making a sale. "By talking only to volunteers, Permission Marketing guarantees that consumers pay more attention to the marketing message," he writes. "It serves both customers and marketers in a symbiotic exchange."<p>  Godin knows his stuff. He created Internet marketer Yoyodyne and sold it in 1998 to Yahoo!, where he is a vice president. Godin delves into the strategies of several companies that successfully practice permission marketing, including Amazon.com, American Airlines, Bell Atlantic, and American Express. Permission marketing works best on the Internet, he writes, because the medium eliminates costs such as envelopes, printing, and stamps. Instead of advertising with a plain banner ad on the Internet, you should focus on discovering the customer's problem and getting permission to follow up with e-mail, he writes. <I>Permission Marketing</I> is an important and valuable book for businesses seeking better results from their advertising. <i>--Dan Ring</i></span>

                    <span>Mr. Seth Godin, V.P. Direct Marketing at Yahoo!, tells us how to turn strangers into friends and friends into customer in the excellent book on how to be successful in marketing your products and services. I can only hope that every SPAM marketer, direct mail marketer and fax-blast marketer reads this book. Perhaps if they do, we will all have a lot fewer useless intrusions in our lives.
<br />
<br />The bottom line of this very well written and entertaining book is that Godin advises us that "The goal is to avoid surprising the consumers and interacting with them by sending only messages they expect." Those of us who were trained in consultative selling techniques will recognize much of what Godin advocates, but he packages even these "old ideas" in such a way as they are now usable in the new world of internet communications and e-commerce.
<br />
<br />Godin gives us the logic behind what most of us have intuitively decided is true - TV advertising doesn't work, direct marketing (as done today) is a waste of time and money, we are squandering our internet marketing opportunity, and we are alienating potential long-term relationships. Godin outlines for tests for permission marketing which, by definition, offers consumers incentives to accept advertising voluntarily. Permission Marketing must: 1. encourage learning relationships with your customers. 2. track the people who have given you permission to communicate with them. 3. provide marketing curriculum to teach people about your products/services. And 4. allow you to deepen your permission to communicate with those people in your permission marketing database.

                    <span>Mr.Godin is an excellent teacher of how to market effectively.  Before reading this I thought of marketing probably like most do.  I thought to be successful in marketing and advertising, that big was the way to go...big magazine ads, t.v. spots, target a large audience and you're sure to get lots of customers, etc.  WRONG!  <p>Mr. Godin hits the bull's-eye on the type of marketing that it takes to acquire and keep customers in your business.  It is not mass marketing to anyone and everyone that's going to do it. But rather, Mr. Godin shows you how to set up a specific strategy, a clever method in which to acquire the type of customer you want to your particular business.  If you own a sports shop, then your ideal customer wouldn't be a chef or a construction worker who just happened to walk into your store...it would be the die-hard, sports enthusiast that you want to attract.  Mr. Godin shows you how to attract your "ideal" customer; He teaches you how to get your ideal customer to come to you.<p>I didn't fully understand all that "Permission Marketing" was really about until Mr. Godin broke it down and explained it to a tee. If you can get a potential customer to say "yes" to you prior to the sale, your chances of acquiring them as an actual customer dramatically increases.  This is what Mr. Godin shows you how to do.  He is a wise marketer and you can be too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</span>

                    <span>So there are steps in every transaction. The whole point of this book is that you don't create lifelong relationships with strangers. Every sale consists of multiple mini sales. <br>turn the page<br>click the link...<p>You go to amazon<br>browse through books<br>see related books<br>browse through reviews<br>buy the book<p>While some of the data relating to the internet is outdated, the fundamental message of the book is still strong.

                    <span>The suggestion that the old is out and the new, permission marketing, is in has been so thoroughly disproved by actual experience that it's reasonable to ask, just why does anyone believe there is anything behind that screen that a little tiny man pretending to be the Wizard?<p>A few marketers tried to implement these ideas and found they had offended far more people than traditional advertisers ever had.  For that reason, this books ranks with books touting Day Trading as the route to riches.  No, never: nonsense.<p>I couldn't even bear to offer this to a used bookstore.  Instead, we used it as kindling for a fire.  Expensive, but the result was good, and perhaps better than a PrestoLog.</span>
