                <span id="Label1"><div>The German invasion of Russia was Hitler's biggest gamble in his quest for "Lebensraum" in the East--and it was at Stalingrad that his gamble failed. <i>Stalingrad: The Infernal Cauldron</i> is a detailed history of Hitler's great failure, and a comprehensive account of one of the most important battles of World War II. With full-color strategic maps, 170 black and white photographs, over half of which have never before been published, and detailed appendices that contain information on orders of battle, losses, and equipment, <i>Stalingrad</i> is an exhaustive account of the battle that bled the German army dry, and turned the war in the East decisively against the Germans.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Stephen Walsh's book on Stalingrad is an excellent one volume primer on this epic battle. The narrative can be a bit dry at times, but the author definitely knows the subject. Mr. Walsh gives a background, covering the first year of the war with Russia, and then shows how the German campaign for 1942 was flawed from the very beginning. As he points out, it has been convenient to blame Hitler for all of Germany's East Front problems, but very few German generals objected to Hitler's plans for 1942. <P>The book is broken down into logical chapters and also covers the other armies involved, such as 17th and 1st Panzer which attempted to seize the Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus. The Soviet side is not ignored either, the author shows how the Red Army slowly developed into a force that was able to hold its own and give almost as good or better than it had been receiving.<P>The book has a huge number of photos, many I had never seen before, the photos were great, unfortunately the captions were sometimes misleading or incorrect. Such as pg 33, shows a photo of Von Manstein with another Whermacht General & a Luftwaffe officer. The caption identifies the unknown Whermacht General as Heinrich Himmiler. I don't think even Himmiler could wear General's insignia and a Knight's Cross! Pg 54 shows a Soviet T-34 that wouldn't have been in action until 2/43, yet it is clearly a summer picture (probably taken during the Kursk battle) Pg 12 identifies a German private (Machine Gun crewman)as an officer, possibly because he's holding a pistol. There are others, but you get the point. Overall, the photos are a great addition to the book though. Many photos of Soviet troops don't have the usual "propaganda" look to them. And, alot of good photos of Germany's allied troops, page 106 shows a Rumanian heavy machine gun of a type I've never seen, a caption identifying it would have been helpful. In Walsh's defense, these may have been the captions supplied with the photos. I still think this is a good book for the money, with corrected captions I'd give it 4 stars.</span>

                    <span>As the author of a book on Stalingrad myself, I am delighted to recommend this volume as the best introductory overview of the Stalingrad campaign and battle. It isn't aimed at specialists (although they will doubtless still gain much pleasure from it), but at the general reader and the military "buff". They will delight at the book's careful research, its gentle but convincing argument and its clear and engaging prose.<P>It may, as the first reviewer noted, have one or two tiny errors, but that's all they are. They certainly don't detract from the marvellous level of scholarly competence demonstrated throughout.<P>I am hoping to meet Mr Walsh one day, not only so we can chat as fellow scholars about a topic that clearly captivates our interest, but also so I can get him to autograph my copy of his lovely book, which sits alongside my own, Anthony Beevor's and John Erickson's on my bookshelf. I am proud to own Walsh's lovely book, and believe you will be too.</span>

                    <span>This book serves to capture some of the drama that was the battle of Stalingrad. It fails, however, to leave the reader with an understanding of the horror of war or a clear view of what events were critical.<P>"The Infernal Cauldron" is long on detail as to the specific movement of troops but, in so doing, serves to lose the reader from the bigger picture. We are constantly updated as to where particular Armies and Divisions were moving but are shown few maps. The reader is thus easily lost in the minutae without developing a fuller understanding of the battle.<P>Offsetting the flaws of detail, the book has numerous glossy black and white photos that show some of the key players such as Paulus and his generals. It also reproduces other photos of the phenomenal destruction that was unleashed on this one city.<P>Finally, as with all books on the subject of Stalingrad, comparison with Antony Beevor's great work is inevitable. In this regard, Walsh demonstrably fails. Read Beevor if you want to understand and try to comprehend the war for and the siege of Stalingrad.</span>

                    <span>I was pleased to see Dr Joel Hayward's review of this book below. His own book "STOPPED AT STALINGRAD: The Luftwaffe and Hitlers Defeat in the East" (also available from Amazon.com) is, alongside John Erickson's book, easily the best book on Stalingrad. I strongly recommend these Stalingrad authors as best: Joel Hayward, Anthony Beevor, John Erickson, Graig. Your library is not complete without all these.<P>But when we look at this book, by Stephen Walsh, we find a different type of book. It focuses too much on ground operations, ignoring the Red Air Force (VVS) and the Luftwaffe. And it is weak on explaining strategy. To counter these weaknesses are terrific black and white photos, many of them appearing in print for the first time.<P>Walsh's narrative is average. You won't find it as thorough and authoritative as Hayward's or as compelling and racy as Beevor's, but it does the job.<P>Overall, I still recommend this book and give it 4 stars.</span>

                    <span>I gave this book Four stars because it really does give you just the overall Picture of the battle. It has few quotes but the overall strenght of the book is that it goes a long way to explain where each army is and their objective. The movements of each army group and the statistics.<BR>I think this book would better be served called "Operation Blue" because it concentrates a lot on that and that is where all the author gives us the unpersonal view of the battle. He does also talk a lot about Stalingrad but not in a way to actually describe the battle but just to show you where each Corps, Battalion wants to go and who is there to stop them. The book does that really well. Which is if you want a book that explains just that than this book is it.<BR>If you want to know the battle from a personal view, the soldiers, comamders on BOTH sides then Anthony Beevor's "The fateful Seige" is your book. But for what this book does, it does it really well. If you would read this book and Beevor's book at the same time than you would know everything about the battle. But then who has the time for that.</span>
