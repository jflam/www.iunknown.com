                <span id="Label1">Above Seattle. This book has captured Seattle and the places around it, the raw threatening beauty of the Cascade Range and that of the Olympics, the great expanses of water, open fields, the great buildings, the almost blinding greenness (from the air), the tiny ships below, the virgin forests, the lights at night; a city that has fought to preserve itself, a city that has, over the years, paid the price to maintain its own beauty, cleanliness and dignity, a city of which it was once said, "lies well in the arms of the land." Robert Cameron's aerial photographs and text by Emmett Watson makes this a book you'll never want to put down.</span>

                    <span>Seattle is set in a very diverse geographical region. This diversity provides for ample breathtakingly beautiful and lush photographs of the metropolitan area. Lakes, mountains, trees, islands, bays, rivers - this area has it all and is cleverly photographed in this Robert Cameron book.<BR> The book is fairly up to date although citizens or connosieurs of Seattle may notice the dated-ness of the book by the conspicuous absense of some new construction in the downtown area and the changing condition of other areas of the city. If you like pictorials, this is a great one to own and probably one of the best of the Seattle Metropolitan Area. I highly recommend it.</span>

                    <span>Stunning quality; if you've been there, you will easily be able to pick out your favorite spots, despite the distance. The captions are a little dry, but the pictures make this aesthetic book one of value.</span>

                    <span>Everybody who has any relation to Seattle should have this book! To people who live there it shows their city from a different point of view. To people who like to get a detailed impression of the city and its close environment I really recommend it ! But this book (in my eyes) is not made for people who look for a "tourist guide".</span>

                    <span>If you want something special you must buy this book. It's the most wonderful photo-story about Seattle if have every seen. And there's a lot more, the author shows with his pictures the differences between the past and today. All I have to say is : I love this book and I'm you wil too.</span>
