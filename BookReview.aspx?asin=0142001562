                <span id="Label1">Life on earth began in the sea, and in this tour de force of natural history, authority on marine biology and illustrator Richard Ellis chronicles more than three billion years of aquatic history. From the first microbes and jawless fishes that evolved into the myriad species we know today-sharks, whales, dolphins, and, of course, humans-Ellis reveals the deep evolutionary mysteries of the sea. Encyclopedic in scope and complemented by more than sixty drawings, <i>Aquagenesis</i> is a fascinating work that will astonish readers with the wonder, richness, and complexity of the evolution of life.</span>

                    <span>I read the author's very good "Encyclopedia of the Sea" and hoped this would be equally entertaining. It seems this book is more for people who already know a lot about ancient life. There are illustrations, but not enough as the author will describe bizarre, one of a kind creatures, but then not have a drawing of it. He describes contraversies about where a fossil belongs in the classification tree or if a new branch has to be added. I found the "Shape of Life" video much more interesting. This book seems to be a scholarly work, with many quotes and credits given, for other scholars.</span>

                    <span>Aquagenesis: The Origin and Evolution of Life in the Sea Written by Richard Ellis is quite simply a very fascinating book. A book that covers life in the sea from small little creatures too a shark that can swallow a horse whole.<P>Aquagenesis is a book that traces the phylogenic origins of aquatic life further and further back of not only the ancestors of the living whales, seals, manatees, sea turtles, sea snakes and penguins that were terrestrial, and their living descendants all returned to the sea, to one degree or another. But, this book is not without opinion and it plays a considerable role, mainly because interpretation is so much a part of this book, opinions of others are relied on via their published works or directly. But, this isn't a book so much about whales, seals and manatees as it is a book about the beginning of life in the sea.<P>What I found interesting in the book is how the author explains how life and a phenomenon known as sea-floor spreading where cracks or rifts are created in the crust of the Earth are connected. Plate tectonics causes these rifts and minerals spew into the water in clouds known as "Black smokers" that eventually dissolve and disperse into a water columns and life is found where you would think none could exist.<P>Also, the author takes a look at some of Stephen Jay Gould's work from "Wonderful Life" about the Cambrian Shale deposits known as the Burgess Shale. A review of the fossil biota brings the differences in interpretation and conclusions, but the major battle lines have been drawn. I must say that this book takes the reader on a ride of mystery from the first microbes to jawless and finless creatures to a possible aquatic ape that could be mans ancestor.<P>Some of the creatures we read about in the book are quite bizzar and the author has supplied detailed drawings that bring these animals to life. Sharks with teeth on their backs and others had teeth as large as your hand, all making for wonderful reading. I liked the author's narrative style in this book as it was straight forward and easily readable. The subject matter of the aquatic ape is covered toward the end of the book and is quite interesting.<P>Aquagenesis is a book about life in the past, but also how that life shape life today making for some compelling fascinating reding.</span>

                    <span>More lucid science writing from Ellis (Imaging Atlantis, 1998, etc.), who this time cuts a broad swath through the history of marine animals. "This book is about animals whose ancestors came out of the sea and whose descendants returned to it," writes the author. That and a whole lot more, for while almost every aspect of paleontology is rife with ambiguous, speculative, and contentious theories-and Ellis gives many of them sufficient air time in these pages, such as changes in genetic structure to lines of descent-there is no contesting the complexity of the fossil record. And the glory of species complexity is on full display here. From the earliest creatures of the vents, the breeding grounds created by the spreading of the seafloor and strong candidates for the deep-ocean location of the origins of life, to Elaine Morgan's evidence pointing toward an (at least semi-) aquatic ancestor of humans-and she isn't talking about jawless fish, but rather an aquatic ape-Ellis covers an incredible land- and waterscape. There's a rogue's gallery of toothy, spiny creatures (sharks with teeth all over their heads, others big enough and happy to eat a horse) and an equally long list of sideshow marvels, including the wonderful hagfish, which "can emit gallons of nauseating, toxic slime." The theories tendered for the evolution of these creatures are often as fabulous as the creatures themselves: Certainly the descent of whales from giant wolves falls into that category, but less sensational are the beard-pulling contests between academics, such as the Gould/Conway Morris feud. Then there are all the questions that remain unanswered, far more than those with answers, beginning with: How did it all start? Ellis samples from all these topics with the enthusiasm of a child let loose in a candy shop. As entertaining as a three-ring circus, and as scholarly as any intellectually curious lay reader would wish for.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book after reading the author's previous "Search for the Giant Squid". Giant Squid was very good. This book however,is a double edge sword, it has great illustrations and the topics look interesting, BUT many facts are wrong! <P>Examples: page 2, states that the Dinosaurs "disappeared hundreds of millions of years ago" (65 million years would have been correct.) Page 117 identifies the Mississippian Age Bear Gulch Formation as Devonian Age. Page 51 and 52 and 53 list Horseshoe crabs as dating from 200 million years ago but there are well known horseshoe crabs as old as 370 million years old! <BR>Page 53 also lists Aglaspids as being horseshoe crabs when they are not considered to be.<P>I teach, and the accuracy of material is important. I don't want to present ideas to my students if they aren't right. The book is interesting, but the errors I see at a quick skim make me pause.</span>

                    <span>How did early life evolve in our oceans, and how did they evolve from the sea to become land creatures? Aquagenesis provides a history of sea life and its evolutionary processes, combining the author's illustrations with a scientific examination of the origin of life in the sea.</span>
