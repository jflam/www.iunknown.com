                <span id="Label1">The multitudes of Gary Paulsen fans (or more accurately, <I>Brian</I> fans) will be thrilled to find that the author has penned yet another story about Brian Robeson. Although Paulsen once claimed that he would "write no more about Brian," he seems to have been softened by the "staggering amounts of mail from readers" begging for more about the teen who is more at home alone in the wilderness than in the hustle and bustle of city life. In <I>Brian&#146;s Hunt</I>, the 16-year-old returns to the remote woods and lakes of Canada, where he encounters a mysteriously injured dog. His experiences two years earlier, after surviving a plane crash and months alone with only a hatchet to protect and provide for himself (<I>Hatchet</I>, <I>Brian&#146;s Winter</I>, etc.), have prepared him well to survive now. But can anything prime him for the horror that awaits him on an island campsite where he intends to meet his Cree friends? <p>   This short episode is rife with the kind of gritty--even gruesome--details readers have come to expect from the Newbery Honor author. In an afterword, Paulsen reminds readers that he bases his stories on personal experiences and his extensive knowledge of the wild side of nature. <p>   Confidential to avid fans: an intimation of romance amid all the rugged drama hints that <I>this</I> will not be the last <I>Brian</I> book, either. (Ages 10 to 13) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I></span>

                    <span>I think that the book Brian's hunt was one of the best books that I have ever written. The book just kept me wanting to read. My teacher read it out loud but it felt like I was there with him this time. This book was the best book of 2004 that I have ever read. I think that I would not write so much stuff. It didn't end like I was thinking. It was the better then what I thought it would of ended. I loved the book from began to the end.</span>

                    <span>Brian's Hunt is the sequel to Gary Paulsen's Hatchet and continues stories about a boy named Brian and his wilderness skills. Brian's Hunt brings Brian back to the wilderness where a lone camping trip results in a wounded dog's appearance. As Brian cares for her, he faces the dual challenges of helping her and his Cree native friends in this moving story of courage.</span>

                    <span>This a good read. Though it is shorter than most of Paulsen's work, it is good. I didn't like the changes though. Like he brought more books than what The List in Brian's Return said, freeze dried food, the three pairs of moccasins, the monoculars, and the barbed fish tips for his arrows. Plus it didn't mention Caleb, after all he wouldn't be there without him. And it didn't mention his medicine or Billy. It was written in a different in a different way than the other Brian books. If you have read the other Brian books you will see a different writing style. It might be because Brian is finally in a hurry to get somewhere, but The River isn't written in this way. Overall I liked it and will continue reading Paulsen's work.I have been reading for more than seven years and liking his work. I have never and probably never find a Paulsen book I don't like.</span>

                    <span>This is one of my favorite Gary Paulsen books. I really enjoyed the twist of Brian finding a friend in this book, instead of being all alone. Also, he finally starts to notice girls. I also enjoyed the suspense of the mysterious island. His hunt for the bear that caused all the problems(I won't be specific because I don't want to ruin the story)is also very enjoyable.When he finally finds the bear, enjoyment and suspense come togethet with action, to form the perfect ending:the final battle between man and beast. I thought Brian's Hunt by Gary Paulsen was a great book.</span>
