                    <span>I found this book very enlightening. A must read for anyone who is interesed in holistic healing, especially with light and color. In the book Dr. Liberman tells of healing with a series of 20 colors. It would be great if he revealed in the book what these colors are. Missing is a "how to" section that would enable people to put his discoveries into practice.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent and opens the reader to the possibilities of alternative practices through the use of color therapy for healing that are potent, powerful, and profound. I would also recommend "Light Years Ahead" for the first book, followed by this book. Dr. Liberman reveals a strength of vision and depth of experience in his new book which connects the reader to the many possibilities of very real healing with color.</span>

                    <span>The Bible says, "The light of the body is your eye", when your eye is clear, your whole body is clear..." Lieberman has this knack for blending scienctific thought with phenomena revealed in optical research. For instance, does the common virus have a certain "color" to it? Can people be healed by being exposed to certain colors to counteract the effects of their illnesses? I think Lieberman is onto something here - it's just the tip of the iceberg. Why do so many of us require glasses as we age? Are we on the wrong track during our lives; are we disengaging something within our brains and causing a blurring to our vision? Food for thought.</span>

                    <span>Jacob Liberman, who has doctorates in both optometry and vision science, says that the people who live on Earth evolved to thrive under the light put forth by our sun. He says, therefore, that we potentially harm ourselves when we hide from sunlight. In Light: Medicine Of The Future: How We Can Use It To Heal Ourselves Now, he explains how to utilize the therapeutic benefits of light. Dr. Liberman says that "light is the basic component from which all life originates, develops, heals, and evolves." Everything that humans do is affected in some way by light. Light has been used for healing since the time of ancient Egypt. Modern scientists began recognizing the benefits of light therapy in the late 1700's. Although many people believe the ultraviolet (UV) light is harmful, Dr. Liberman maintains our bodies need at least a small amount of UV light in order to function properly. He cites studies which indicate that, due to all the ways in which we block sunlight from our lives, including wearing sunglasses designed to block out UV rays, "it is possible that we are unknowingly contributing to the increased incidence of blindness and eye disease in this country." Dr. Liberman does warn against looking at the sun directly, or exposing ourselves to it between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., but emphasizes that light is a nutrient for the body. He says people need to be outside in natural light, without sunglasses or sun block, for a minimum of one hour a day. He warns that warm-white and cool-white fluorescents "should absolutely be avoided." People who cannot get outside regularly need to equip their work areas with full-spectrum light fixtures. Syntonics is the name given to light therapy, which involves utilizing specific colors for healing specific ailments. Dr. Liberman discusses its benefits in treating vision problems, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), cancer, and learning disabilities. He says that "as we continue to discover and understand the role that light plays in our lives, its use as both a therapeutic and preventive tool will become more evident." Because each individual is different, Light: Medicine of the Future doesn't get into prescribing particular colors for each potential illness. It is an invaluable reference, however, for all those interested in natural healing. Extensive appendices provide sources of supplies and a listing of light therapy practitioners. <P>Sandra I.

                    <span>I am thrilled with Jacob Liberman's "Light Medicine Of The Future!" Liberman covers a broad spectrum of light applications, no pun intended. His studies include hard evidence and documentation of these studies. His personal research on full spectrum light is astounding. Many physical and mental problems can be attributed to mallilumination. The studies prove that children and adults exposed to poor lighting, especially that of cool white flourescents, harbor many ill effects. As the sales manager for a company specializing in full spectrum lighting, I have recommended this book to many customers and close friends. I also find myself referring to information located in Liberman's book almost daily. A great find!</span>
