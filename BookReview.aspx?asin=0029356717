                <span id="Label1"><I>Showstopper!</I> is a vivid account of the creation of Microsoft Windows NT, perhaps the most complex software project ever undertaken. It is also a portrait of David Cutler, NT's brilliant and, at times, brutally aggressive chief architect.<P> Cutler surely ranks as one of the most impressive software engineers the field has ever produced. After leading the team that created the VMS operating system for Digital's VAX computer line--an accomplishment that most would regard as a lifetime achievement--he went on to conceive and lead the grueling multi-year project that ultimately produced Windows NT. Both admired and feared by his team, Cutler would let nothing stand in the way of realizing his design and often clashed with his programmers, senior Microsoft management, and even Gates himself. Yet no matter how involved he became in managing his 100-programmer team, he continued to immerse himself in every technical detail of the project and write critical portions of the code himself.<P> <I>Showstopper!</I> is also a fascinating look at programmer and managerial culture behind the Microsoft facade. The portraits of the men and women who created NT not only reveal the brilliance of their work but the crushing stress and the dislocating effects that new wealth had on their lives. For some team members, the NT project ultimately destroyed their marriages, friendships, and virtually every human relationship outside of work. <I>Showstopper!</I> also reveals the uncertainties, false starts, and blind alleys that dogged the project as Microsoft repositioned NT from an improved OS/2 to something that would ultimately challenge both OS/2 and Unix for the title of the world's most powerful operating system.</span>

                    <span>It's really a wonderful book! If you are a software developer trying to figure out how the big projects are done, or if you are just someone who is trying to figure out what is inside a software developer mind, go and read it.<p>For software developer:<br>Don't forget, it's a book written by a non-technical person. Sometimes, the writer tries with no success to explain the difference between C and C++, the function of the memory manager and other ones. The first chapter of the book is just terrible. He starts telling the NT's manager history, since he was a child. But don't give up. The book will get really interesting after the second chapter.<p>For software developer relatives:<br>Want to understand why your husband stays working until late hours? Want to figure out why most programmers think they are the best human beings alive? Read this book. I hope you can understand us reading this. I'm still trying to make my wife read this. :-)</span>

                    <span>I bought this book with a lot of anticipation.  I work in the software<br>industry, and in my company am responsible for managing the entire<br>chain of software development, from requirements to release.  I was<br>very disappointed both with the recounting of the technical<br>difficulties as well as that of the personal challenges encountered by<br>the contributors to NT.<p>In a nutshell, I found the book to be quite bland.  The counterpoint<br>was weak and the difficulties of the NT team hardly tangible.  Part of<br>the problem with the book is it has so many disjointed pieces that the<br>result is an incoherent patchwork.<p>Also, I was shocked to see how little reference was made to Unix, it<br>was perhaps mentioned once.  Let's face facts.  Most of what NT wanted<br>to be already existed in Unix.  Multi-process, multi-user,<br>network-enabled, access security, advanced file system, kernel space<br>protected mode -- for all the great things that NT was supposed to<br>include, it was just a Unix wannabe, which already had all this and<br>more.  It's clear that most of what went into NT was cloned from Unix,<br>but there is no mention in Zachary's book of how Unix influenced the<br>construction of NT.<p>It is hard to believe that NT independently ended up looking so much<br>like Unix, but from the recounting in Showstopper, this is what<br>Zachary would have us believe.  Perhaps he was just misled in his<br>interviews (the sin of ommission?), however it's clear that he either<br>did not do his homework, or he explicitly did not want to tell this<br>somewhat embarassing (for Microsoft) part of the story.</span>
