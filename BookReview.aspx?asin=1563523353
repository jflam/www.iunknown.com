                    <span>Papert's previous books, Mindstorms and the Children's Machine, set the gold standard for thinking about learning and constructing knowledge with computers. While those books focused on learning at school, The Connected Family uses natural "home-style" learning as a metaphor for thinking about how glorious the construction of powerful ideas can be regardless of the setting in which learning occurs.<P>Papert argues that the proliferation of low-cost personal computers and net access throughout society shifts the locus of learning innovation from the school to the home. This ability to learn in new ways and learn new things at home creates an opportunity to unify the family around the pursuit of knowledge. Papert asks us not to view the computer as a polarizing force in our lives, but through charming examples challenges us to seize the opportunity to create new collaborative learning opportunities and strengthen existing ones in the home and school.<P>Papert's discussion of what's wrong with most educational software (for a start its not educational) provides parents with critically important consumer information. The simple ideas for computer-based learning projects (and accompanying CD-ROM) inspires us to use the computer as an intellectual laboratory and vehicle for self expression.<P>The Connected Family was written for parents and grandparents and is thus an easy-read. However, the number of profound ideas expressed elegantly in its pages makes the book one you will read over and over again.<P>Read the Connected Family and then read The Children's Machine and Mindstorms. If you ever finish, share them with friends.</span>

                    <span>Seymour Papert has shared many things in this book. He also finds a way to formulate a connection between children, parents, and educators. Seymour's conception of the link between the computer is a very strong bond. The computer is being used as a tool to reach the generation gap in technology recognition. Although Seymour's belief's are very argumentive, his teaching is not traditional. I strongly agree with his explantation about the connected family. He provides the parent and child an opportunity to learn and become aware of the technology around them, without being afraid or lost. In conclusion Seymour Papert has enlightened my awareness as well as children and their parents in the field of technology. Overall, I would strongly recommend this book to many of our parents and educators.</span>

                    <span>Seymour Papert's The Connected Family is better suited toteachers than parents, since its chief criticism concerns schools' useof computers. He seems to believe that since schools are doing such a poor job of finding new and innovative uses for computers, he will target families in an attempt to allow children at least some positive experience with computers. While this is not a bad idea, I think his time would be better spent encouraging schools to rethink their use of computers. Certainly families should develop common interests and work together on projects, but children spend so much more time in school that changes there are likely to have a greater impact. I hope that many teachers find the time to read this book and consider making changes in their use of computers.<P>Teachers of very young students often recognize exploration as legitimate learning, but as the age of the student increases, the tendency is to decrease the time spent on exploration and increase time spent on instruction. This is done in the quest for efficiency in spite of the fact that we all know the most powerful lessons in life come from experience (exploring and experimenting.) It is Papert's idea that computers are best used as alternate universes in which students can continue to explore and experiment. <P>It used to be that you could explore a piece of technology and learn how it worked (picture peering into a manual typewriter,) but with increasing reliance on microprocessors this is laregly untrue today (picture peering inside your PC.) Papert's ideal of learning through exploration cannot occur when the working of the world is opaque. His solution for computers is to ignore the hardware (it is hopelessly opaque) and focus instead software. Don't ask children to merely use software but ask them to program a computer. This will reveal the workings of the digital age and remove some of the mystery of computers. <P>Papert poses some interesting ideas in this teaser of a book. I'd like to see more work done towards developing the type of software he imagines. The book's web site ... may have once had some of this, but it has now been replaced by ... a kid-oriented, but very limited site ...</span>

                    <span>Some of the most important things that I as an educator and parent took away from this book was the involvement of both the parents and teacher in the education of their children. My asessment of the book was that he uses the computer to increase the communication of all family members and show the uses of the computer. The one thing that stayed with me the most was the saying "Not why the computer but how the computer". That means to think of ways to include the computer in your everyday life. This is a book that all educators should have and encourage their students parents to get.</span>

                    <span>I didn't have a full understanding of what Papert meant, when he spoke of typical schools and typical homes. He seems to be implying that children coming from these enviorments can't be computer literate.</span>
