                    <span>Nothing exciting about this book.  May be a good bed time reader if you are in the process of looking for jobs [aren't we all??? :-)].  Some common sense topics restated.  But neatly written book.  No complaints on that.</span>

                    <span>My sister-in-law, who interviews people for a living, took a look at this book when it came in, and pronounced it excellent. For many of us who have been in a position for a number of years, interview skills are something that most definitely does *not* come naturally. This book helps bring people like myself over the hump to feel more at home in basic interviews.</span>

                    <span>This was a great book for preparing to ace the interview. I especially liked the section on persistence. Another fantastic book I found that not only covered the interview but also gave an entire road map for the job hunt was "10 Insider Secrets To Job Hunting Success!" by Todd Bermont.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I would highly recommend this book for job interviewing preparation.  Also recommended for job interview preparation are the job interview guides published by Vault.com, including the Vault Guide to the Case Interview and the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews.  Good luck!</span>

                    <span>Ok, so you're looking for a book on interviews - well, look no further. This book does not only give you practise questions and answers but it covers many important topics like 'globalisation', how your MBTI profile can help you and NLP.  I think this book will be especially helpfull if you're aiming at higher profile jobs (or moving into).  Ofcourse you need to do your own homework (maybe get your MBTI profile done i.e. know yourself, read more on other topics etc), but the book puts you on the right track. The only book I will ever need to use or refer back to. Indespensable!!</span>
