                    <span>When you see Coach Riley on the sidelines, the perception is one of a model straight from the pages of GQ. His suits are always custom-tailored, and his hair is slicked back. But when you read his words, you will discover another dimension that perhaps is not congruent with his tough-guy media image.<P>Mr. Riley demonstrates a high degree of common sense both on and off the basketball court. You will feel the toughness of his spirit, but also the kindness in his approach. This book is a great resource, since it demonstrates how to lead and how to follow to ensure maximum success.<P>His lessons from the hardwoods can be applied to any business or team-oriented situation. He describes in great detail his approaches with both the Lakers and NY Knicks. He discusses in very frank terms his own failures as a coach, but more importantly, presents the reader with examples how to reach our own peak performance levels.<P>His motivational techniques were very informative. He takes us inside of intimate situations that forged his winning ways. From tense playoff day game meetings, to providing custom towels for his players, Coach Riley spares no detail to win. The reader will realize that Mr. Riley learned from the best, and was able to succeed at the highest levels of his sport. He shows us that being a team player starts at the top, and that leaders need to set the proper example.<P>He also includes several non-basketball related events that provide added motivational value. The story about Jan Scruggs, the force behind the Viet Nam War Memorial, is compelling. This book is not about basketball; it is about finding the winner within each of us as we navigate challenging life events. <P>Out of his many enlightening quotes, two stand out: "You can respect your opponent too much." "Don't compare your performance versus other teammates; compare it against others in similar roles on other teams."<P>Thank you for the opportunity to review this book.</span>

                    <span>As a MBA student I have learned the need to work well in teams, this book is excellent. You don't have to like basketball to enjoy it. I will admit, I hate the Lakers (GO SACRAMENTO KINGS!), but the analogies of teamwork and life go hand-in-hand with business and any setting where hardwork and teamwork materialize. Read this book with a highlighter handy, you will want to identify sections, quotes, and sayings that you will use in the future. Well worth the price and the time to read it. This is one of my favorite all-time business books.</span>
