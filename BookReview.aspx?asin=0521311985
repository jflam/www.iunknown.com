                <span id="Label1">Peter Kenez's History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End examines not only political change, but also social and cultural developments.  The book identifies the social tensions and political inconsistencies that spurred radical change in the government of Russia, beginning at the turn of the century and culminating in the revolution of 1917. Kenez envisions that revolution as a crisis of authority that posed the question, "Who shall govern Russia?"  This question was resolved with the creation of the Soviet Union.  Kenez traces the development of the Soviet Union from the Revolution, through the 1920s, the years of the New Economic Policies--which he sees as crucial to any interpretation of the history of the Soviet Union--and into the Stalinist order.  He shows how post-Stalin Soviet leaders struggled to find ways to rule the country without using Stalin's methods but also without openly repudiating the past, and to negotiate a peaceful but antipathetic coexistence with the capitalist West.</span>

                    <span>Peter Kenez outlines all of Soviet history succintly yet completely. He argues that the Soviet "golden age" during the NEP (New Economic Policy) was doomed to failure because the Bolshevik state, by definition, could only function as a one-party, authoritarian power. <P> Indeed, Kenez argues that the Soviet Union was always authoritarian, with the exception of Stalin's reign, when it was a totalitarian state. Stalin ruled with power that was so absolute that the Communist Party was deemed insignificant, no other figured gained lasting influence in government, and all were potentially subject to his terror.<P>The Soviet Union met its demise and fall because the the regime could not reform itself and still remain in existence. The flawed, top-down structure of the economy, particularly the constant failures of collectivized farms, assured that the Soviet Union could never see economic prosperity comparable to the West.<P>Kenez's ideally-sized history offers an intriguing, and critical, history of the Soviet Union. It is anti-Soviet, but still objective: for example, Kenez argues that the Cold War Soviet Union had neither the desire, nor the capacity, to promote worldwide revolution. The one glaring flaw of this book is its sparse treatment of Cold War diplomacy, as it argues that the Soviet crises were almost entirely from within.<P>The book is an effortless read. Its most gripping effect is that you likely walk away convinced that Josef Satlin was doubtlessly one of most evil men in recorded history.</span>

                    <span>This is a brief but complete history of Communism in the Soviet Union from the days of the October Revolution to its recent collapse. It's main focus is on politics and economics but other topics (including even cinema) are discussed. A little dry at times but always readable. Does not require any real background in history to enjoy. Higly recommended for anyone seaking an overview of this fascinating subject.</span>
