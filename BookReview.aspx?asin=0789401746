                    <span>When I first got into photography not so very long ago, I was rather overwhelmed at the number of beginner books. I happened upon this book late one night and decided to buy it because at a glance it looked good and the price was certainly right. After closer inspection I discovered I had found a little gem. <P>This book is 72 pages and about the size of a big index card. It is in full color and covers the following topics: Choosing Equiptment, Basic Skills, Using the Controls, Which Lens, Choosing Film, Composing Your Picture, Using Color, Pattern and Shape, Using Natural Light, Using Flash, Photographing People, Special Subjects and Presenting Prints.<P>The book has a bit of a predjudice towards the 35mm SLR beginner, but even a beginner point & shoot person can learn a great deal. In short, it is a brief book that packs a punch! I highly recommend this for beginners.</span>

                    <span>I'm a novice photographer and was looking for something more indepth. The book has a lot of great tips, but I was wanting more basic information about how to use apertures, shutter speeds, etc... and in a portable/pocket style. I think this will be a good resource once I become more experienced in photography.</span>

                    <span>This little book is GREAT! It was one of many books that I bought when I took my first my first round with an SLR. I really got more out of it than several of the more impressive (& expensive) books that I bought! I carried it around in my camera bag forever and referred to it many times. Then when my daughter showed an interest in photography it is the one I picked to get her started. If you are just starting out.. don't sweat the 5 bucks!</span>

                    <span>I recently bought a Canon Rebel 2000 and need a small simple book with guidelines on taking better pictures in a variety of different situations. This book is WONDERFUL!!! Gives many "real life" examples and shows sample pictures of everything the author talks about. A must for anyone wanting to take better pictures.</span>
