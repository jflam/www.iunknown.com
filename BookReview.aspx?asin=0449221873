From the brutality and brilliance of the ancients, to the iron fist of the invading Spaniards, to the modern-day Mexicans battling through dust and bloodshed to build a nation upon the ashes of revolution, James Michener weaves it all into an epic human story that ranks with the best of his beloved, bestselling novels.<br>A MAIN SELECTION OF THE BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB<br></span>

                    <span>As a 1st time Michener reader, I loved Mexico. Michener weaves a story that is at once a tour-de-force of bullfighting, a sweeping panarama of Mexican history, an apologetic of the Mexican psyche for (typically) arrogant North Americans, and an exploration of the purpose of life for a middle aged Mexican-American journalist. It is a credit to Michener's art that he can pull off all that in a seemless and gripping read.</span>

                    <span>This book was certainly different than most Michener historical fiction books. For one thing it's a tiny bit shorter which is a welcome relief. Secondly there was more stuff on bullfighting than there was on the history. I really wasn't that interested to begin with, but found that I did get more interested as time went on. The story was a good one, but I like to see more history and that's why I've read each of his historical fiction books. This is my last book in his list and it was a fun one.</span>

                    <span>Michener says it himself in the closing pages of MEXICO: There has to be more to Mexico than bullfighting. But in reading this novel about the country, you would hardly know it. Set around a journalist, Norman Clay, who is covering a bullfight, the reader is offered only tempting tidbits of what Mexico has to offer. I read JM's TEXAS, last year, which contained large portions that included descriptions and events in Mexico. I assumed MEXICO would be more in depth and touch upon the rich culture of the Aztecs. I was somewhat disappointed.<P>Though MEXICO did provide glimpses into the past of the Indians living in Mexico before the Spaniards came, the clashes with Cortez and the Conquistadors was sorely missing. The Spanish rape of Mexico was barely tapped and I really wanted to read more about the politics that shaped today's nation of Mexico. JM shortchanged the Mexican and Mexico with this book. TEXAS was so brilliantly written, I guess lightening couldn't strike twice. <P>On the up side, I learned more than I ever wanted to know about bullfighting. Though brief, the sections on the early Indians and the building of the pyramids was vivid and informative.</span>

                    <span>This is actually my first experience with Michener, who I've always been curious about. I am so impressed that I can't wait to begin another one of his fabulous tales. He's a wonderful writer, one who can balance the details of bullfighting with history with rich characters and an enjoyable story. The writer uses bullfighting to tell the story and there may be more details on the sport than you care to read, but they take up a small space in the whole novel. To Michener fans, it may not be the best, but I definitely think it's worth a read.</span>

                    <span>I have read many Michener novels, and enjoyed almost all of them. 'Mexico', however, is terrible.<P>If you set out to read this slow-moving behemoth, then you'd better *really* like bullfighting. There are just so many long and boring sections on the topic. It was such a struggle to get through it all.<P>The early parts on Aztec culture were fine, but after that I almost needed to tape my eyelids open. Talk about dull and dry. I couldn't wait for it to finish.<P>If you are tempted to read this book, slap yourself a few times and go and get 'Alaska' or 'Chesapeake' instead. Please.</span>
