                <span id="Label1">Two years after its release, the second edition of David Siegel's <I>Creating Killer Web Sites</I> remains a bestselling guide to building sites that are driven by design aesthetics rather than technological prowess. Now, in <I>Futurize Your Enterprise</I>, Siegel takes off his Web designer hat and turns his attention to developing a corporate online presence aimed at meeting consumer needs. He cautions readers to throw off their old bricks-and-mortar mindsets and focus not on "how to build a Web site but how to build a Web business." Siegel divides the book into four parts--"Principles," "Practice," "Prototypes," and "Predictions"--that moves from "tools and methodologies you'll need to transform your management-led organization into what I call a customer-led company," to fictional case studies that show how these techniques may be applied today, to speculative future scenarios "in which the Internet is no longer a tool but a platform for work, community-building and individual empowerment."<p>  His suggestions include establishing an autonomous Web division that takes the medium more seriously than itself, encouraging (if not insisting that) all employees interact directly with online customers, and factoring in participatory or community aspects that actively attract those who share demographics or specific interests. Some may find that Siegel's recommendations suffer because of his repeated use of fictional case studies to make his point. However, those looking for new ideas will surely find some here. <I>Futurize Your Enterprise</I> is for Web masters, business people, and the many that Siegel won over through his earlier books. <I>--Howard Rothman</I></span>

                    <span>"Futurize your Enterprise" of David Siegel is an excellent visionary book for every manager who wants to rethink business models and develop an E-strategy. It is not about "how to build a website" but how to build a web business. The book is divided into four parts:<P>"Principles" describes tools and methodologies to change a "management-led" and supply driven company into a "customer-led" company. This part is illustrated by real word examples like Toys-R-Us Direct and Hewlett-Packard. "In a customer-led environment everyone in the company is responsible for the customers experience". The principles part also contains a very clear description of Internet failures and the six most common mistakes companies make online. It also explains the natural development from brocureware Internet sites to real e-business. There is also a definition of different e-customers the transparency of the Internet.<P>"Practice" is the translation of the principles into practice. What does a company have to do to change into an e-business. There is a practical list of changes the company has to make and agenda's of meetings to organize those changes.<P>"Prototypes" contains a number of examples business categories like grocery stores, magazine publishers, steel fabricators, real estate clearing house, book superstore, software company etc. These examples use real-life examples as starting point, and show the many possibilities to improve the customer influence by the Internet.<P>"Predictions" shows speculative future scenario's in which Internet is no longer a tool but a platform for work, community-building and individual empowerment. The examples are fictional but very insightful and expiring. They show the possible developments into the year 2010 of the different roles of people like job seeker, homemaker, breadwinner, teenager, student, patient etc. <P>For retailers the prototypes of a grocery store and a book store are very interesting. "Futurize your Enterprise" does not touch the challenge of fulfillment of online retailing, but there is much attention for the possibility to add information to merchandise, and the importance to focus on different customer groups. For groceries these different customer groups might be households with young children, different religions with there own food restrictions, people with allergies etc. For bookstores Siegel does a good job trying to improve Amazon.com.<P>"Futurize your Enterprise" is focused very much on the culture, the mindset, the approach and the customers.<P>Siegels book is in my opinion a must for every manager who is planning to develop E-strategies. It bridges the huge gap between "Internet evangelists" and "How to"-books. The book is now the number one present for clients of my company.</span>

The book is made of a pile of pure stupid, simplistic ideas without any foundation. The author wrote a book about web design in 1996 and in 1999 he wrote this book, now about how people will do business in the future. The result? Just a pile of pre-dotcom-blow guru [junk]...<P>I read this book just because I needed to do it for a course I attended and it was a torture. I wanted to throw this book in the trash can every time I finished reading one of its paragraphs, but I couldn't.<P>If you don't believe me, just browse the book and you'll see how it stinks.</span>

                    <span>Let me preface this review by saying that I am a big fan of David Siegel and I have enjoyed his other books. However, "Futurize Your Enterprise" doesn't have the staying power that his other books have. This book was written in the late '90s and therefore Siegel has the same tone that many new media pundits has at that time which is a sense that nothing could sink this ship, not even God himself. As I read through it I cringed time and time again at how irrelevant some of his comments are in today's economy. This book would have been a best seller even today if the bottom had not fallen out of the Internet market. Unfortunately, this reads more like a time capsule or history book rather than contemporary business book.</span>
