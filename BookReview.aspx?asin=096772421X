                    <span>Robert Guyer hit the nail on the head with this book.  "The Guide to State Legislative Lobbying" is a wonderfully insightful examination of the lobbying process.  The book goes well beyond the academic exercise of understanding the process of lobbying but provides actual useful tools in how to navigate the legislative machine and get results!  The book is a must read for all who are involved in the lobbying process both for seasoned professionals and novices alike.  The book provides strategies on how to ensure that you are engaged in creating effective change through lobbying for your constituents. </span>

                    <span>Consider this Legislative Lobbying 101. Robert Guyer's Guide to State Legislative Lobbying is as practical and informative a guide to the fundamentals of successful legislative lobbying as you are likely to find. And it's packed into cogent, readable chapters. The straightforward, accessible narrative carefully describes the major legislative procedures, political tactics and strategic choices confronting any modern lobbyist or advocacy group attempting to achieve visibility and influence in state legislative policymaking.  The candid discussion constitutes a practical education in the legislative process especially useful to policy advocates new to legislative decisionmaking, but there's plenty of helpful information for anyone who wants to understand how policy is actually made in legislative chambers.  In addition to thoughtful tactical advice, the book is especially valuable in leading the reader through the labyrinth of the formal legislative process which can easily intimidate and confound the uninitiated.  The book is a  keeper. </span>

                    <span>I am more than a little surprised by the previous review and feel compelled to add my 2 cents.  I have found Robert Guyer's book essential to my own lobbying efforts.  Certain aspects of the lobby game may remain outside one's control (the money tossed around by opponents, the strength of a particular constituency), but this does not negate the importance of Guyer's book -- a richly informative guide that transforms the art of lobbying into more of a science, providing insight into the elements crucial to any successful lobbying venture.  After reading it (and taking Guyer's course), I was much clearer on what I needed to do to hit a home run.</span>

                    <span>The Guide shows that speaking to lawmakers is about 10 percent of what it takes to win their votes. It reveals, and shows readers how to do, the other 90 percent of activities that are 'behind the scenes' but make all the difference between winning in the legislature and just talking to lawmakers.</span>
