                    <span>Over the years, I've read a number of books on Excel programming. Each one seemed much like the previous one, generally talking about writing macros and creating data-entry forms. Professional Excel Development takes  the concept quite a bit farther. Rather than giving you the same old tired lessons, this book goes into detail on exactly how to build professional level applications. It even explains how to make your Excel-based application look as though Excel had nothing to do with it. Suffice it to say, this ain't your daddy's Excel book.
<br />The authors, Stephen Bullen, Rob Bovey, and John Green, show a level of sophistication well beyond the norm. They'd rather teach you the proper way to program instead of teaching you how to use Excel. In fact, the first thing they do is distinguish five different levels of usage: Excel users, Excel power users, VBA developers, Excel developers, and professional Excel developers. The book is written for the highest level, so expect a lot of depth. The entire structure of the book builds around a time-entry application that is developed from a simple spreadsheet to a full-blown, production quality program. A CD-ROM is also included with all of the source code and multiple examples that are scattered throughout the book.
<br />Reading Professional Excel Development is not something to be taken lightly. The authors have done a fine job putting together a cohesive methodology for using Excel as an application development platform. I know of no other book that covers this platform in such depth. At times I found myself lost in the details, but I suspect a "professional Excel developer" (which I am not) would be delighted in the depth of description and copious examples provided.
<br />Professional Excel Development is an extremely well-written book that covers the use of Excel to a depth few authors have dared to tread. The text gives you the tools to build applications that are much more than automated spreadsheets. Almost any program your imagination can devise can be created using the techniques given, which is a testimony to the power of Excel. Bash Microsoft if you want, but they do sometimes come up with a winner, and Professional Excel Development allows you to take full advantage of its capabilities. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>Being a full time Excel consultant and developer I have heard many times the same thing that the authors put in the introduction: "Excel as a development tool ? that's not for serious use...".
<br />
<br />However, this book is the way to prove them wrong.  They show the reader how to turn your Excel-based applications into a professional one, without having to sacrifice all the good things that you have when you code in Excel (and other VBA enabled applications).</span>

                    <span>A disclosure: I know the authors professionally and consider them if not friends then at least professional colleagues.  That said...
<br />
<br />This is a must have book for not only the advanced and professional developer but also the advanced beginner or intermediate developer who wants to know what s/he should aspire to. The authors discuss a wide range of very useful development techniques that one can leverage to build 'industrial strength' solutions using not only MS Excel but also other Office products.
<br />
<br />As the authors themselves indicate, the book has a lot to offer the experienced developer.  Not many books on this subject can make me go, "Umm...that's interesting."  This did.  Several times.  The breadth and depth of their expertise is apparent throughout the book as they discuss topics ranging from worksheet design to user interface design to charting to debugging techniques to the use of 'external' programming languages.
<br />
<br />Even those who may disagree with some of the recommendations about 'best practices' will find most disagreements to be of style and degree rather than substance.
<br />
<br />Advanced beginners or intermediate level developers serious about improving their skills will also benefit from this book since many chapters recommend 'best practices' - general rules, design of worksheets, command bars, and user forms, error handling, etc.
<br />
<br />As another reviewer noted some of the chapters come across as an overview to more niche development environments.  The authors do a very good job of building bridges between Excel and those advanced technologies - examples being XLLs and COM Add-ins.  While fully understandable why they cannot address all those technologies in detail, it does leave the reader interested in those niches hungry for more.
<br />
<br />Two quibbles:  First, I was disappointed that the authors did not address worksheet range selections in a user form.  Given the otherwise thorough nature of the book, this was a startling oversight of an important topic.
<br />
<br />Second, some of the chapters contain material that the advanced developer ought to know - ironically making the book more valuable to the advanced beginner or intermediate developer.  For example, the chapters on data manipulation, charting, and VBA debugging made me go, "Huh? Why is this here?"  While very good in its own right, such material seemed out of place in a book of this caliber.
<br />
<br />Overall, anyone who develops or wants to develop software for 'heavy duty' and practical use in the MS Excel and Office environment should have this not just on their bookshelf but within easy reach.</span>

                    <span>In this excellent resource for intermediate to advanced Excel users, every chapter has practical ideas that will help you design robust applications more quickly and consistently. The 'Best Practices' and 'Worksheet Design' chapters have valuable tips for setting up your workbooks, even if you won't use programming. Advanced users can add to their programming skills, by applying the book's techniques for using API calls, creating add-ins, building custom charts, and many more features.<p>You can work through the book's exercises, using the CD's sample files, to build the sample application. Or skim through the book, and use it as a reference for its advanced topics. Either way, the book will pay for itself many times over.</span>

                    <span>Professional Excel Development is an excellent resource for somebody like me, proficient at both Excel and VBA, but who wants to create user-friendly, efficient and maintainable Excel-based programs.  The book lives up to it's title, teaching you how to create professional applications.  Although it contains a wealth of knowledge about VBA, the focus is on how to maximize the power of Excel using a variety of tools, of which VBA is just one.
<br />
<br />I am only about one-third of the way through, but I can testify that the writing is clear, the concepts eye-opening and the examples instructive.  I haven't found anything not to like about this book, but here are some of the things I like most:
<br />
<br />- Chapter 3 contains 40 pages of best practices, which I will re-read more than once.  I especially appreciated the sections on encapsulation - separating data from code - and the later sections that explain how to do so.
<br />
<br />- At the beginning the authors stress that a professional Excel developer is one whose programs take full advantage of Excel's powerful features before turning to VBA.  They then demonstrate several powerful data validation and user interface techniques that were new to me, and that require no VBA.
<br />
<br />- I love messing around with customized menus and commandbars.  This book includes an amazing table-driven commandbar-building system that is beautiful to behold, and that the authors generously encourage you to integrate "into any of your applications."
<br />
<br />- The commenting of the code on the CD is great.  It makes it easy to understand, and to find specific bits that I want to incorporate into my programs.
<br />
<br />This book is worth every penny (and I paid full price!).  Thanks to the authors for doing such a good job of sharing their development expertise.</span>
