                <span id="Label1">Quickly master all the skills you need to build your own compilers and interpreters in C++<br>    <br>    Whether you are a professional programmer who needs to write a compiler at work or a personal programmer who wants to write an interpreter for a language of your own invention, this book quickly gets you up and running with all the knowledge and skills you need to do it right. It cuts right to the chase with a series of skill-building exercises ranging in complexity from the basics of reading a program to advanced object-oriented techniques for building a compiler in C++.<br>    <br>    Here's how it works:<br>    <br>    Every chapter contains anywhere from one to three working utility programs that provide a firsthand demonstration of concepts discussed, and each chapter builds upon the preceding ones. You begin by learning how to read a program and produce a listing, deconstruct a program into tokens (scanning), and how to analyze it based on its syntax (parsing). From there, Ron Mak shows you step by step how to build an actual working interpreter and an interactive debugger. Once you've mastered those skills, you're ready to apply them to building a compiler that runs on virtually any desktop computer.<br>    <br>    Visit the Wiley Computer Books Web page at: http://www.wiley.com/compbooks/</span>

                    <span>This is a down'n'dirty book on how to create a complete Pascal compiler. The book is heavily loaded with massive amounts of code, code which is at times very repetitive, since the author keeps improving on his classes time after time, writing the complete class code each time. If you can read C++ code as well as english, this is a great book to learn every detail about creating a compiler.
<br />
<br />The book also cover alot of interesting off-topics, such as programming technique and code management. It is quite obvious that Roald Mak is a very gifted programmer.
<br />
<br />I would not recommend this book to anyone who hasn't been doing regular C++ programming for at least 2-3 years. But then again, who else would care about creating their own compilers? ;)</span>

                    <span>I bought and examined this book thoroughly. There are so many old concepts I wonder whether the author has ever re-read its current second edition. It is supposed to have been written for C++ programmers but of what generation? I understand that the current 2nd edition was written after the release of MS Visual C++ 4. So, the source code still assumes that C++ doesn't have the true and false Boolean constants since the author #defines them, which causes an error in both Visual C++ 6 and later. In fact, the use of #include <iostream.h> and void main()indicate that the book is not ANSI compliant. The web site that supports the book provides source code, for MSVC 4 (only after I bought the book, which is extremely expensive, did I find out on the 4th page that it was released in 1996; but the current C++ Standard is from 1998). I tried compiling them in MSVC6 and MSVC.NET. None of the programs compiled (none at all). Even after re-creating the programs by adding files manually, I received many many errors. I tried to fix them and also tried compiling from the Command Prompt, to no avail. It is true that we don't have that many books on compiler development but just as these books are rare, this particular one will be to no help. It is (very) old and its programs don't work. The only things you might get are the authors comments that may help you with some suggestions or guidance, which will be little.</span>

                    <span>It is a good book and its implementation of a Pascal compiler functions fine, but I didn't like the way the code was only partially object oriented. It's hard for me to understand why the author went to the trouble of making 90% of the code object oriented and then used some global variables that should obviously be members of some of the classes. Other than that, the book was very easy to understand.</span>
