                <span id="Label1">The Successful Physician: A Productivity Handbook for Practitioners will enable you to streamline, modernize, and improve your practice -- using practical, proven, common-sense methods any physician can apply. Filled with easy-to-follow, easy-to-implement suggestions, this book is written for the practicing physician by a practicing physician. Three major sections show you how to improve your use of the three major tools -- your time, knowledge, and relationship management. By investing a small amount of time and effort into upgrading the use of any one of the tools, you'll free up additional resources to re-invest in further efficiency and productivity-- resulting in greater personal satisfaction and less risk, hassle, and frustration.</span>

                    <span>This book really "works"-it's getting rid of the stress in my medical practice. The text is fast reading, no-balony, actually entertaining-loaded with great examples, quotes, and vignettes that drive home the many pearls (and a fair scattering of diamonds) or practical wisdom. I was immediately able to tell this book was written by practicing docs just like me: no wheezy absrtractions, no boring theory-mongoring, and no long lists of desirable (but impossible-to -achieve) "ideal" practices. Instead this is smart, practical stuff I have been able to use immediately to save myself hassles and wasted time/motion/effort. I highly recommend to all physicians the section on how to leverage your relationships to produce more, and also the section on continuing education, which was an eye-opener for me. I personally feel that every practicing physician should have a copy of this book,and use what's in it. Get this book today-it will work for you.</span>

                    <span>I was quickly overwhelmed after starting a practice straight out of training. This book has helped me manage my practice, my patients and my continuing education without feeling overwhelmed. I continually refer back to it. He quickly gets to the heart of the problem (too much to do/too little time to do it in) and helps you prioritize your goals. He then gives you very specific tools to help you control your practice and not have it control you. This book is for any physician who feels they are approaching burnout and resents the ever increasing demands on our time. Straightforward and to the point. Some of the time-saving tips seem obvious, but organizing the 'tips' into an overall game plan is what makes this book successful.</span>

                    <span>How wonderful to read a physician who has a writing style that doesn't cause nausea, retching, or confusion. My wife, also a physician in a by-gone era, and I laughed and laughed and laughed at this psychiatrist's insights into what is wrong with doctors. I particularly liked the concept of NIH (not invented here) because I was the Assistant Chief of Medical Neurology at NIH (The National Institutes of Health) and knew exactly what the author meant. If a certain group didn't think of a great idea first they would have nothing to do with it. The main trouble with most doctors is, of course, that they went to medical school. There they learned to do what they were told and not spend much time thinking about it. Consequently, they have become the easy prey of business interests whose general effect has been to transform and some say injure the profession by telling Doctors what to do. Doctor Zaslove's little gem of a book has the way out of this embattled situation for those physicians smart enough to read and take its advice to heart.</span>
