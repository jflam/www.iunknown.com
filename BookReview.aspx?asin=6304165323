                <span id="Label1">Ka-<I>boom</I>! Who isn't fascinated by the giant exploding mountains, from Vesuvius to Mount St. Helens? DK certainly is, as we can see from <I>Eyewitness: Volcano</I>, a thrilling adventure that combines their trademarked eye candy with the latest scientific understanding. Intriguing for all ages, the incredible close-up footage of lava flow and other volcanic processes will keep the whole family coming back again and again. Learning about how and why these destructive monsters are made, how they contribute to creating new rocks and land, and how they have affected human life through the millennia has never been this much fun or stimulating. There's nothing else like <I>Eyewitness: Volcano</I>; it belongs in every family's library. <I>--Rob Lightner</I> </span>

                    <span>My mother and I enjoy watching the Eyewitness videos which are jam-packed full of scientific information and beautiful imagery. Eyewitness Volcano is no exception. It covers some of the basic concepts of Volcanoes from eruption to aftermath. It includes an encapsulated account of the eruption of Vesuvius to the eruption of Mt. St. Helens. <P>In particular, I like the Eyewitness videos because they give plenty of information, without going into many of the gory details. I only wish they were longer! Suitable for the entire family, and nature-lovers everywhere.</span>

                    <span>My four-year old loves this video. I was worried that the content would scare him, but it is well done. It keeps his interest every time he watches it. Eyewitness videos are a great resource for any subject your preschooler is interested in. The dinosaur one has also been a big hit.</span>

                    <span>I've got about fifteen eyewitness videos and this one is one of the very best. (This one, coincidentally, is also my five year old's favorite.) Some of the eyewitness videos are capable of putting you to sleep faster than cheap beer after a twenty hour day, but Volcano won't. The other two eyewitness videos I highly recommend are "Ocean" and "Human Machine." The rocks video is a snooze (I'm a seismo/geologist and it even puts me to sleep). The planets one is OK, though I thought there were about two minor things on it that were wrong. The desert video is kind of a snooze, as well. Bears is a little bit better, but you get tired of seeing the cute and cuddly bears by the end of it--it doesn't hold up well to repeated viewings. Surprisingly, trees is pretty wonderful and keeps your attention to the end. Monsters is another great one. (The little guy loves that one too.) Don't get mammals--they made it using a bunch of stock video, the narraration sucks. But it's definitely better than rugrats. If you have kids, I strongly recommend getting lots of the videos in this series. Buy them a new one a week. It's ten times better for them, than letting them watch the cartoon channel--an activity which will completely rot their brains out. (...) Better to sit kids in front of an eyewitness video, where they learn wonderful things about our beautiful world.</span>

                    <span>This video was great! It showed all about volcanos, some earthquakes. For example, my favorite part was when the orange juice explodes (you have to see the video to get it!). I would definately recommend it. It even tells you about a new island called Luigi?</span>
