                    <span>Okay, This book might be slow but again this was one of the books i used that open the doors to the macromedia field which I'm in now. This book is very basic and her videos which are in side the CD is the key really. The book is good the cd in this book is great. Perhaps one of the best ideas any author can do, make a cd with video. I'm not kidding i had a final to do in flash okay and me as a 3d designer i added 3d into my flash website for my school(keep in mind she doesnt teach 3d stuff in flash) believe me people i learned flash in 1 day basically i stayed up day and night and got hooked and learn the basic and pass with a big A. True story this is a great book and the author she did a hell of a great job. But like everyone said its slow if you read it, it's very slow because she's very basic and wants the person to really get it the first time instead of going back and trying to read the whole thing over again, but indeed this is a great book.</span>

                    <span>Nice book on Flash, but the authors lie when they say you can use this software on Windows ME. I had tried some time ago to install Flash MX 2004 on my home computer (which uses Windows ME) and found that my operating system was not supported. The book comes with a CD with a trial version of the software. Because they state explicitly in the book that this program WILL work, I tried installing it again. No dice. The authors should have been more conscientious in checkng their facts; this doesn't give me confidence in the rest of their information.</span>

                    <span>Your search is over. Hands down, the best "how to" book I have ever used! Superb and extremely pertinent exercises that are explained so clearly and consistently that even I, actually a Flash beginner who decided to stretch a bit and start off with an intermediate level book, was able to get into it and be productive immediately. The author's method for creating a "modular" system is so smart that if you follow his lead, all your Flash based projects will download and render at lightening speeds all the while being very easily edited and updated. Bravo!</span>

                    <span>I taught myself Flash using a variety of sources and I agree that finding "intermediate" books on Flash is quite difficult, so I was quite excited for this one. The instruction in the book is good and sometimes a bit too basic, but what kills me is the videos! (how many times do you need to explain the fact that the movie is running at 21fps??). I would also assume that most readers will be familiar with the concepts of cutting, pasting, creating new line breaks using return, and so forth. 
<br />
<br />Good concepts, but the explanations can be sped up quite a bit! (I've been running the movies at 2x the speed and understand him just fine). 
<br />
<br />Okay, now that that's off my chest. Good book. </span>

                    <span>After completing Yeungs intro to flash book, I thought the title of this one would fit me perfectly.  I was not dissappointed.
<br />
<br />Having conquered the basics of flash, the next logical step is actionscript.  Shane picks up nicely where Roseanna left off by introducing you to coding a website using actionscript.  I found myself constantly nodding and saying "Now I could do the same thing by creating multiple movies but using actionscript makes it so much easier and decreases the file size significantly".  He doesn't assume any prior knowledge of actionscript, and brilliantly walks you through the basics of each and every object he uses (even when the command is similiar to ones you have already used). 
<br />
<br />I don't understand how the previous guy had problems understanding the author.  I am by no means brilliant when it comes to flash and I found myself skipping over a lot of his explanations because they were too detailed.  And the exercises are flawless.  I did have some problems working some of them out, but when I retraced my steps I found that it was my error and not Shane's (such as embedding fonts-- I followed the MAC directions when I had a PC).  Another thing that guy said is that he doesn't use the LoadMovie command.  I don't know how he missed the REASON why he doesn't use that command (it is now or will soon be deprecated).  He clearly says this in the book and introduces you to a nice alternative (MovieClipLoader class -- Not the myMC which was just the object that was instantiated from this class).  My advice to that guy is Yah Roseanna's book was great, but it's time to move on man.  That was an introductory book and I know it's hard to learn new things after you have been taught one way, but this author will not lead you astray.
<br />
<br />My only complaint is the material is dry.  I mean ActionScripting just isn't as fun as tweening movies and making pretty animations but that is something that is unavoidable.  Shane's writing style is refreshing and does a great deal to ease this boredom.</span>
