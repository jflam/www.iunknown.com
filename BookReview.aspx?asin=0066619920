                <span id="Label1">The word <i>no</i> has figured prominently in our popular culture in the past two decades. "Just say no." "What part of 'no' didn't you understand?" The idea is that <i>no</i> is easily understandable and always definite, as if all social interactions were as simple as that of a parent laying down the law for a child. But as any child quickly figures out, the word <i>no</i> usually means there was a flaw in negotiating strategies, and is only a temporary setback.<p>  That's where Stephen Pollan steps in. As a financial and legal consultant, he coaches clients into favorable resolutions to their problems, whether they've been turned down for business loans, offered great jobs they have reservations about, or been fired from jobs they knew they were good at. In <I>Turning No into Yes</I>, he argues that the path from no to yes involves six steps: figure out the real problem; deal with just one problem at a time (often there are clusters of problems contributing to a rejection); focus on facts and put aside emotions; become an expert on the situation (in others words, know what people in your field make; why your superiors may have turned down your proposal; and who is really undermining your efforts behind the scenes); make sure the people you're dealing with really know and trust you; and, if it's still an issue after you've gone through those steps, get them to reverse their decision and tell you yes.<p>  The beauty of <I>Turning No into Yes</I> is that Pollan and his cowriter, Mark Levine, use real-world examples to demonstrate every point they're making. We see partners in an art gallery work out a sticky ownership issue; an NBA basketball player learn to become a true businessman; an editor at a magazine get the raise he deserves. Somewhere in this book you'll recognize yourself as well as a situation you've found yourself in--or will soon find yourself in. And once you've read it, you'll want to keep it on your shelf for the day when the situation you never anticipated comes to pass. <I>--Lou Schuler</I></span>

                    <span>Turning No into Yes : Six Steps to Solving Your Financial Problems (So You Can Stop Worrying)<br>by Stephen M. Pollan, Mark Levine<p>This book demonstrates to the reader how you can look beyond your cash flow problem to the underlying issues, and then gives sound advice and principles in how to deal with those underlying issues.<p>In every case the path from no to yes is similar:<br>1. Determine your problem. Is the loan delayed because the banker doesn't like you, or because your income statement doesn't show enough in the asset column?<p>2. Make sure your dealing with one problem at a time. Don't try to rework your marketing at the same time that you trim your staff.<p>3. Focus on facts, Make sure that your own fears and worries aren't blinding you to the way things really are.<p>4. Become an expert. Immerse yourself in your problem; assemble all of the information you need to understand your needs and wants, as well as those of your opposite number.<p>5. Create an environment of trust; and, if you need to, Turn NO Into YES.<p>Now that you know the secrets to the authors principle, you should invest in this book and read hundreds of scenarios , ahowing how this technique can be applied in your life, and eventually become a piece of your self-worth fabric.<p>This book is like having a motivator, coach, and strategist at your home all of the time.<p>Highly recommend this book, and suggest you put it in your financial literacy library today!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book because I was familiar with the authors (I had read  their books Die Broke and Live Rich which helped me very much). In the  first part of the book, They explain the six step-approach to solve  financial problems.I was really looking for a book like this one. We face  many kinds of money problems every day. In the past I bought books about  logical decision making and none is more useful and well thought than this  one. Parts 2,3,4,and 5 give examples on how to use the method. I recommend  to read these parts; they can be consulted in the future if are not needed  at this time. Also by reading them, the whole concept is better understood  and practically the six steps are memorized. Please do not think that you  need to behave robot-like and use the entire six steps every time you face  a problem. In my opinion,this book teaches that We need to approach every  financial problem as much rationally as We can.And The more We try to do it  the better We are going to become at it.</span>

                    <span>The book gives you straight answers on how to face challenges, financial and otherwise, that come your way in life: on the job and at home. I liked the examples the authors used; they were vivid and real.  Bottom line is  solve the problems you face and take responsibility for your  actions.<p>Recommend this book in conjunction with another book on self  direction and leadership I use called:  "The Leader's Guide: 15  Essential Skills."</span>
