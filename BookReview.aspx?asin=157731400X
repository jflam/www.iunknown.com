                <span id="Label1">Expanding on his mantra&#151;<I>Get out of your head and into the moment</I>&#151;Eckhart Tolle offers this new book on living in the now. Here  Tolle emphasizes the art of "inner stillness"--the place where thoughts, ego and attachments fall always and we are left only with what the moment has to offer: "When you lose touch with inner stillness, you lose touch with yourself. When you lose touch with yourself, you lose yourself in the world." Don't expect this to be a quick skim or even a straight-through read. Like his previous bestselling book <I>The Power of Now</I>, Tolle uses brief entries and numerous white spaces to give readers easy in-and-out access into enticing spiritual insights that expound on inner stillness, such as learning the difference between surrender and resignation, overcoming the fear death, and how to end suffering. In fact, this is designed to be an ongoing conversation. Pick it up any time or any place, but be sure to allow for plenty of breaks for serious contemplation. Even as you occasionally abandon the book, don't abandon the teachings, pleads Tolle. Embracing and practicing inner stillness is no longer a luxury, he writes, "but a necessity if humankind is not to destroy itself. At the present time the dysfunction of the old consciousness and the arising of the new are both accelerating. Paradoxically things are getting worse and bett! er at the same time, although 'the worse' is more apparent because it makes so much noise." Devotees who have read all of Tolle's books and audio tapes probably won't find new ideas or information here. But they may appreciate the refresher course --revisiting familiar concepts in a slightly different package. --<I>Gail Hudson</I></span>

                    <span>I'm a fan of Tolle - I consider his previous book a masterpiece. In my humble opinion, It's the best rendering of unitary/enlightened/samadhi consciousness humanity could ever hope for.
<br />
<br />When I started reading this book I became irritated at first. Again with the repetitions? Wasn't the theory explained already? Until I let myself go and tried to accept what Tolle is trying to do.
<br />
<br />THIS IS NOT A BOOK IN THE ORDINARY SENSE!!! Tolle is explicitly stating the reader should spend more time experiencing the content than reading (careful: thinking is not experiencing). I was wrong to dismiss this instruction and when I did figure it out I was BLOWN AWAY.
<br />
<br />I can't believe Tolle has actually managed to top himself. While "The Power of Now" is where you should start, this book is a perfect follow-up. A profound METHOD (not really a BOOK in the classic sense) to stir the profound and by all accounts EXTREMELY COOL form of existence you could be having, hidden from you by experiencing existence as a continuous stream of thought and by the involuntary and habitual identification with that stream ("thought-identification"). Although difficult to do in everyday life, the basic truth in the thought dis-identification premise is easy to verify in meditation: even as a beginner, your thoughts go away for all of 2 seconds yet you are still you. So you are in fact THE AWARENESS THAT EXPERIENCES THOUGHT. Get it?
<br />
<br />So this "book" goes over from theory and touches the actual practice. But meditation still seems to be the effective way for calming down, combined with the lifestyle additions that support it by reducing stress in our nervous system: trigger point therapy followed by a steady yoga practice (trigger points are best explained in "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook" - you wouldn't believe the amount of pain in your body of which you are not aware! unlikely you are brave enough to work it out by yourself, so give the book to a massage therapist!), and a diet as free of stimulatnts as possible: nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, garlic, aerated drinks etc.
<br />
<br />Although most yoga teachers are unaware of it, the deepest yogic meditative state of Samadhi meditation - letting go of thoughts WITHOUT concetrating on an object as in "ordinary" yogic meditation - can be learned directly, without 20+ years of yoga practice. It's easy to learn, but you need to practice for a few months for the full effect. Example: www.ssy.org (mostly India-based org, courses in English are conducted in Pune, near Bombay).
<br />
<br />(note: Samadhi consciousness, or the consciousness component in enlightenment, is the result of the continuous practice of Samadhi meditation)</span>

                    <span>I can't argue with any individual section of the book.  It's all right on the money, and 100% true.  However, the problem I have with the book, is that while Eckhart explains why we should quiet our minds, he doesn't really explain the best ways we can apply this knowledge into the real world, here in the 21st century.  
<br />
<br />This book is written, based on the same exact principles that made the author famous.  His "The Power of Now" books, which were fantastic.  This book offers pretty much nothing new, but a condensed version of his other books.  However, this book lacks the "How to" that his other books do.  I wouldn't mind seeing a few chapters on how we can fit this sort of thinking into our real world lives.  How we can quiet our minds in certain situations, with examples.  The information in the book is solid, but I know personally, and from speaking to others, we're thirsting for more upon completion.  Almost as if we got the message, but have no clue how to apply it properly to our lives.</span>

                    <span>I love this book.  It has helped to heal and to strengthen my spirit.  Among the most valuable books I have ever read.  I read a little bit almost every day and it helps bring me to a calmer more peaceful place.  I feel happier, I feel closer to those around me, and I feel that my life has become a much more open and beautiful thing since I have been reading the book.  I recommend it to anyone.</span>

                    <span>I thought Stillness Speaks is a rehash of "The Power of Now" in one sense, but also a distilled version of "The Power of Now".  The words Mr. Tolle says are meant to be experienced though it is the same old philosophy as "The Power of Now".  That is why this book has lots of white spaces.  That is why it is sectioned out with all the small paragraphs.  If a book full of words is the one you feel you can get as much money back as you can, this is not the book for you because you are focusing too much on gaining knowledge.  You want to adopt the words even before you can pause to see whether it makes sense to you.  Your mind wants to be occupied with all the words so you cannot stop and to reflect.  
<br />
<br />This is a book you are not supposed to rush it through and read all of it in one day (though you can surely speed read it and be done in 2 hours because it is thin without too many words).  It is supposed to be a book you read only one chapter a day to pause and to reflect slowly.  You feel the words and you taste the words.  You experience what he said without the noise that is always talking and judging.  Then, you experience love and peace.  Then, you are awakened from that voice in your head that is always talking and judging (egoic mind).   
<br />
<br />Also, when you are reading this book, you are supposed to take Mr. Tolle out of the picture as an identity (meaning the form of a spiritual teacher - does not matter whether you respect him or not).  Mr. Tolle's words are just a gateway to our spiritual awareness to be in the presence and stillness.  The words are meant to inspire and help us return to our authentic self (inner peace) - which exists in the presence.  When we get into the mental position of, "What was he thinking when he was writing the book?" or judging "isn't it just a rehash of The Power of Now", you have already missed the point of the book - which is to stay presence and feel the words to achieve stillness.  If you already have the book, why not read it with an open heart rather than complaining the white spaces/thin book?  You already have it in your hands.  Why can't you read it with gratitude and see what the words have to offer you?

                    <span>Stillness Speaks is a profound book that has taught me how to go within, where inner peace dwells, and the clamor of outside influences can now be as they are, without my getting caught in the midst of the outer turmoil. I learned a great deal from this book, and I thank Mr. Tolle for bringing it out. </span>
