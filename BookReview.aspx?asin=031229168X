                    <span>At last, a well written, well researched book on one of America's most fascinating ladies, Abigail Adams.  Based on carefully interjected original research and letters, this book provides a long needed look at the issues and challenges that faced Abigail Adams.  The author portrays her as a woman, very much in love with her husband, very much in love with her country, and very willing to try to balance the needs of both.  It is striking to realize how totally independent she became in financial affairs, and in domestic issues. The book reminds you of the challenges of communications and distance.  It also makes you aware of the personal sacrifices this family made for the young, emerging nation.  The focus of the book is on Abigail, but sufficient information on the political events and political players is provided.  An excellent look at a very important person.  Don't miss it if you enjoy this period of history and are anxious to understand more about its key players.</span>

                    <span>Abigail Adams by Phyllis Lee Levin is an excellent companion work for David McCullough's John Adams. <p>Throughout life Abigail and John were inseparable, best of friends, and each others life. Through circumstances John was away in the service of forming a government and the duties to a new nation, but Abigail was not far from his heart, nor he from hers.<p>We see an unabated ardor in her for her "Best Friend" in life. Abigail Adams saw and wrote with clarity about the time leading to and after the Revolutionary War, and events following and her humanity. We have a unique perspective of the life and times of this period through her eyes written for posterity through her letters to a variety of people surrounding her life.<p>Not since Barbara Bush, has a woman been both a wife and mother to a President of the United States, even though she dies before John Quincy is elected. Abigail kept her family close to her heart and was the one to keep the family together and the family homestead viable in John's absence.<p>This is a well written book, solid in research, flowing prose and good details. This book captures Abigail Adams and shows us her intellegence and her perceptiveness of the events of her times. She wrote letters to Jefferson and had comments about all of the people, albeit caustic or poignant, close to John's work and life. <p>She loved John and missed him greatly when he was away, her letters attest to that, but when she was at his side both flourished. This book gives us a great insight into how Abigail was as a woman and how she coped with private and public life.<p>I recommend reading and enjoying this book.</span>
