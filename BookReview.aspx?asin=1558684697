                    <span>Since I got myself involved into landscape phototgraphy I have been a fan of David Muench's breathtaking large format images.
<br />I purchased several of his books and my favorites so far are Plateau Light and Colorado II. So it is with excitement that I ordered this book. But for the first time I have to say that I am quite disappointed. The work here is quite inequal in quality. One great image is sometime next to an average one. Looking at the credits, I realized that most of the pictures I do not like are from March Muench. It is clear to me that he's still got work to do to catch up with his father in terms of image quality and composition. Overall, I would say that there's about 1/3 of absolutly great images, 1/3 of good ones and the last 1/3 of average (average for someone like the Muenchs but still better than most week-end photographers).
<br />Overal I sometime have the feeling that this book is more a catalog than a real, coherent work of art.
<br />If this is your first California book, buy it, you will be amazed by some of the pictures. But keep in mind that this far from the best David muench has produced over the years.</span>

                    <span>I love David and Marc Muench's photography and this book is a treasured addition to my library. The color and production values are exquisite and up to the high standards I expect from Muench.<p>These photos capture the  awesome beauty and fantastic variety in California's natural landscape  through the seasons. The book is divided into sections for the mountains,  forests & plains, coast and desert.<p>Muench has brought new life to  many often photographed landmarks with his mastery of light and detail. He  has also uncovered many beautiful but less known places; dawn & dusk  skies, vibrant flowers, delicate waterfalls & more.<p>James Lawrence's  accompanying text touching on a wide range of topics relating to  California's natural history is fascinating and entertaining. I have loved  spending hours with this magnificent book.</span>

                    <span>This book confirmed my feeling that David Muench is, for lack of a better description, the Ansel Adams of color photography.  I already owned his Appalachian Trail book, "Uncommon Places" (I think it's called),  but my brother wanted a California-related book for Christmas, so I picked  this up, sight unseen.  Quite simply, it's breathtaking.  The photos span  the length and breadth of the state, from Humboldt County's misty redwood  stands to the La Jolla coast, to Yosemite and the mountain passes and lakes  of the Southern Sierras along the John Muir Trail.  There are even a  handful of urban photos that make downtown L.A. look quite nice.  If ever  you doubted that we live in the closest to a natural paradise as there is,  take a look at this book, and doubt no more.</span>

                    <span>The most beautiful book with California's photos I've ever seen. I have already one book by Muenches and when I so this one I didn't have to open it to make sure it's gorgeous. But it was even better then I expected.  It  has 4 parts: Mountains, Oak and Grass, Coast and Deserts. So, you are not  gonna miss any detail of nature in California (of course poppies, redwoods  and spanish moss on the trees are there too). If you want to make somebody  going to California give him this book :) I promise anybody will fall in  love with California and Muenches' books.</span>
