                    <span>I first used this book as the required text for my course in ML in 1997 and got rave reviews from the students. I will be using it again in 1999. I found ALL of the major topics and issues in ML addressed. The book is easily readable with anyone with a computer science background, and the book works quite well in a wide variety of approaches to presentation at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels.</span>

                    <span>I got this book from the university's library, because I wanted a nice book that can show me different methods for machine learning, so I can learn the buzzwords, and understand their meaning, at least in principle. It was important to me that the book won't go too much in depth into any subject, and more importantly, that the book won't use unfamiliar terminology, unless explained before.<P>This book is indeed a nice overview of the field at the time it was written, although a lot happened in Machine Learning since, the book remains a good source for learning what can be done and how.<P>Reading the book is quite easy (I'm a graduate student in computer science), and quickly I got what I was asking for.<P>This book is not a magic pill for any problem. This is not a cookbook. So the compliments are in place as long as you know what you're looking for.<P>These days I attend a seminar where the students are asked, each student in turn to present one chapter from this book (and some other books). Surely, once the seminar is over, we (the students) will know enough to be able to chat about Machine Learning, and more importantly, we will know where to look for deeper texts if we wanted to.</span>

                    <span>Have you ever bought something that warns "assembly required" only to find out that the instructions are missing? That's a pretty accurate analogy to how Mitchell's book left me feeling. With an empty smile, he hands you a bag of techniques and tells you to go to town. Sure, there are hints about when you might apply particular algorithms, but they are abstract and occasionally hidden in the text. It's as if you've been handed a wrench and told that it can turn things. Huzzah.<P>When describing a field of knowledge, it's important to communicate the "Big Picture." Mitchell does a poor job of this. That is to say that he doesn't do this at all. The lack of a pervasive thread is all the more odd and disconcerting given that his dissertation gave an amazingly coherent description of the process of inductive learning. I suppose I feel a bit taken because there's nothing so tangible or real to hold the disjoint chapters together. So, without any real historical or philosophical context, we're left with something reminiscent of a first-year calculus book. Here's how to differentiate, here's how to integrate, now go figure out what you're supposed to do with those things.<P>Nevertheless, anyone needing a reference guide (think of a shop manual) to machine learning techniques (that isn't quite up to date) would do well to buy this book. Anyone wanting to understand the field of machine learning should probably check out a bit of the competition. I think you'll find that some folks' kung fu is stronger.</span>

                    <span>It's pretty well done, it covers theory and core areas but - maybe it was more the state of the field when it was written - I found it unsatisfyingly un-synthesized, unconnected, and short of detail (but this is subjective). I found the 2nd edition of Russell and Norvig to be a better introduction where it covers the same topic, which it does for everything I can think of, except VC dimension.<P>The book sorely needs an update, it was written in 1997 and the field has moved fast. A comparison with Mitchell's current course (materials generously available online) shows that about 1/4 of the topics taught have arisen since the book was published; Boosting, Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models to name the best-known. The book also does not cover statistical or data mining methods.<P>Despite the subjective complaint about lack of depth it does give the theoretical roots and many fundamental techniques decently and readably. For many purposes though it may have been superceded by R&N 2nd ed.</span>
