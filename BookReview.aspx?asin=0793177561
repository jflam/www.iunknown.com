                    <span>I have attended numerous seminars and read several books, but this is the book I keep finding myself referencing on how to handle different situations. I am not the type of person who typically follows an approach step by step, I like to do things my way but this book gave me some really good ideas. I just completed my first lease purchase based on the author recommendations. It was a win-win. My Real Estate Agent friend (fellow investor) wanted to know how I did it and how it went so smoothly. I referred him to the book.  
<br />I also bought the CD referenced on their website. It contains the contracts, letters and advertising referenced in the book. That was $20 well spent.

                    <span>I've read the other guys' books on Lease Purchasing. Their "take no prisoners" approach somehow just didn't fit my personality. I could not get potential lessees to come up with 3% to 5% up-front option money.
<br />I ordered this book from Amazon and immediately knew I had found a business model that works for me. I think Scott Frank and Andy Heller have come up with a realistic, achievable business model that provides investors a structured process to be successful. 
<br />I have always been a believer that if one can provide true, consistent value, wealth and good fortune will follow.
<br />Scott and Andy have tapped this formula by providing value in the form of providing good housing and a second chance for home ownership to deserving people, while providing consistent profitability to the investor.
<br />To Scott and Andy...Well Done!

                    <span>This was just the book I was looking to find.  I've been interested in learning more about real estate investing for some time, but hadn't found the right vehicle to teach me the nuances from an investment perspective (I've purchased homes for myself several times).
<br />
<br />This book has just the right tone and is written at just the right level-not too basic, but not too intense.  Their approach seems very sound and the authors walk you through each step of their multi-step approach to investing easily.  Smartly, they teach you to remove the emotion from the buy sell/decision (unlike when you buy your own home).
<br />
<br />The authors' unique strategy seems to be the multiple profit sources from their rent to purchase model.  They identify 6 profit sources in their approach that should give a first time investor more protection than the more traditional approach of hoping to buy low and sell high.  They take market timing out of the equation.  In addition this strategy provides for security should economic or geographic factors affect one or two of the profit sources.
<br />
<br />The book's approach seems "doable" for the part time investor which also makes the book of great value.  It does not appear that one needs to be a rocket scientist, or give up their day job, to put the brilliance of this book to work.  
<br />
<br />It's an easy and quick read too, if you are like me, and fear buying treatises that you would never get through.  I highly recommend this book.

                    <span>I've read many books on real estate investment and this is the first book that lays it all out for the reading. Most books give you bits and pieces to get you excited and then try and sell you a whole program for hundreds of dollars. Buy Low, Rent Smart, Sell High gives you a plan that is easy to follow and based on sound business principles. A must read.</span>
