                <span id="Label1">Now that Java is doing more and more in the field, improving its speed  and efficiency is crucial for many working developers. Written by two Sun  insiders, <I>Java Platform Performance</I> gives the experienced Java programmer  plenty of useful strategies and tips for getting the most out of Java code.<p>  This concise book offers plenty of concrete suggestions for improving real-world  programs, but it also helps you think about performance as you design and test  Java software. The authors first look at what "performance" really means. Beyond  raw computational speed, this term can mean reducing RAM footprint, creating  more responsive interfaces, and adding better scalability to programs so that  they can handle more users and data. <p>  A strength of this title is that the authors share their expertise, garnered  from optimizing the Swing classes for Sun. (The tips for creating custom models  and renderers in Swing will help your tables and other controls work with large  datasets efficiently.) This text shows you how to benchmark and profile Java  code and where to look for problem hot spots--and, once these are solved, where  to go next for even better performance. You learn how to reduce object creation  and class loading, which can allow your programs to load faster and consume less  memory. <p>  Also notable here is a solution for letting multiple Java programs share a  single JVM for reduced memory overhead. The authors do a good job of dismantling  the notion that using the Java Native Interface (JNI) is a quick fix for better  performance. (The benchmarked code suggests that in almost every case native  code is likely to be slower.) They also show how memory leaks still can exist in  Java, and how to find them. The book closes with a guide to Java garbage  collection and the latest on Sun's HotSpot Virtual Machine. <p>  If anything, this book will convince you that good performance in Java isn't  accidental; it takes planning, expertise, and plenty of testing. Also, it will  get you thinking about performance in new ways with excellent strategies and  tips that can help you write faster and more efficient Java code. <I>--Richard  Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <table cellspacing="7" border="0"><ul><li>Measuring Java  performance (computational speed, RAM footprint, startup time, scalability,  perceived performance) <li>Engineering performance into the software design  process <li>Benchmarking techniques (micro- and macro-benchmarks) <li>Profiling  <li>Techniques to improve I/O performance <li>Reducing RAM footprint (including  minimizing object creation and detecting memory leaks) <li>Controlling class  loading (eager class loading and patterns for reducing the number of classes)  <li>Running multiple Java programs within the same virtual machine  <li>Optimizing <I>String</I> objects <li>Object mutability and performance  <li>Choosing the right algorithm and data structure <li>The Java  <I>Collection</I> classes and arrays compared <li>Four patterns for the Java  Native Interface (JNI) <li>Why native code is often slower <li>Swing custom  models and renderers for improved performance and scalability <li>JDK 1.3 and  Swing Timers for more responsive user interfaces <li>Deployment and performance  hints <li>Tutorial on Java garbage collection <li>The Java HotSpot Virtual  Machine</ul></table></span>

                    <span>Although this topic could be explored a lot deeper, this is a great book to get started on Java performance. I read it, cover to cover, in a few days on the bus, back and forth to work, and it's changed my approach to coding in Java.<P>The first part on strategies is fundamental and cover concepts on performance. This is a must for anybody who wants to get started on the topic.<P>The second part on tactics goes into details about spesific issues in Java, and because of the GUI / Swing background of the authors, it is mostly focused on topics related to that. If that's what you're working on, this is a 5 star book, but since Java is becoming more and more server focused technology, it's a little bit missing for people like myself who write Servlets and JSPs.<P>Hopefully, there'll soon be a book that discusses performance in J2EE.</span>

                    <span>Although this is a nice-to-have book (for bookworms like us which isn't after all?), I wouldn't really recommend it as the book to buy for Java performance any more, other than for people that are doing Swing, for whom it would indeed be greatly beneficial. Jack Shirazi's "Java Performance Tuning" is becoming the de facto standard Java performance book, and a second edition of it has come out, which is pretty up-to-date. On the other hand, Wilson's book is starting to show its age.<BR> <P>Wilson (the main author) has worked on Sun's Swing team and then on the performance team in the late 90's and that is where he draws his experience from. This book is not geared toward people that do server-side Java (which I believe to be the great majority).</span>

                    <span>I would definitely reccomend this book to someone who is not at all familiar with performance tactics in Java, but this book does not adds much to the much known tactics/tips/tricks used in everyday programming or found on web.<P>Since this book was from Sun Press I definitely expected more from this book considering the depth provided by other books from them. But this book embarrased me by reiterating the tricks already known and introducing the esoteric concept of benchmarking and not providing much details with it.<P>Being a java developer since last 5 years, I didn't learn anything new from this book except the concept of benchmarking which this book brushes lightly without really explaining it well. <BR>Sincere advice: Don't spend your money on this one.</span>

                    <span>It's a shame that Sun fellows can only come with so little material about Java performance.<BR>Even JavaWorld articles contain more information about the subject. For example, when<BR>talking about optimizing the serialization process all authors can offer is to set more<BR>fields to be transient. Is that all you can think of ? How about custom writeObject, folks ?<BR>When discussing data structures and algorithms all authors can say is "choose accordingly,<BR>it depends". Oh, thank you, I didn't know that ..<P>Well, it seems to be that this books was written in a couple of days without any serious<BR>research. Too poor and shallow. All I got from this book is a couple of facts<BR>regarding GC, HotSpot and some other things I didn't know before. And first chapters described<BR>the general tuning strategy pretty well, actually. But that's it. Shame on you, folks.<BR>Just read "Java Performance Tuning" by Jack Shirazi if you have nothing to say.<BR>Or at least make some Web-reserach before publishing a book.</span>
