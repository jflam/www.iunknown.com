                    <span>I'm sure I'll get some flack for declaring this the best surf movie. I don't intend to take anything away from Endless Summer, Step into Liquid, etc. But such movies are more documentary. Other examples such as North Shore, while entertaining, fall short of cinematic.
<br />
<br />Big Wednesday is a semi-autobiographical story from director/writer John Milius. As many have made comments regarding the films philosophic take on life, surfing, and friends, I'll just make a few comments.
<br />
<br />- The films pacing is slower and more deliberate than most films, giving it an almost literary feel. Admittedly, some would call it slow.
<br />
<br />- The story is epic in scope, matching it's pacing.
<br />
<br />- It seems to stay true to the surf culture.
<br />
<br />- It holds great entertainment value if for no other reason than seeing Jan Michael Vincent and William Katt before their sitcom days (Air Wolf, The Greatest American Hero), and Gary Busy before....well, before his rehab days.
<br />
<br />Big Wednesday is part of my movie library. If you enjoy thoughful, coming of age films, and surfing, buy the DVD.</span>

                    <span>BIG WEDNESDAY is, as many have stated, so much more than just a surfie movie.  It explores the friendship of three friends over a 10 year period who just happen to all have a surfing passion.  A film overlooked by many, yet has a great story to tell with excellent performances by Katt, Busey and Vicent.  The surfing aspect is a small part of the overall storyline.<p>I think the marketing people should have released this DVD title with a different cover as it is misleading and cheapens the movie to a great degree. It is so much more deserving than that.</span>

                    <span>I first saw Big Wednesday in 1980 while growing up in Corona del Mar.  My friends and I lived our young lives by this movie without ever realizing the true story told in Big Wednesday is about the changing face of friendship as we grow older.  It's a story about friends being there for each other when it matters.<p>My view of this movie as I push 40 is that it is an insightful classic about what happens to friendship as we age.  It shouldn't be pidgeon holed as a surf flick.</span>
