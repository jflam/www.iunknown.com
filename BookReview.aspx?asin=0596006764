                <span id="Label1">Sometimes the simplest answer is the best. Many Enterprise Java developers, accustomed to dealing with Java's spiraling complexity, have fallen into the habit of choosing overly complicated solutions to problems when simpler options are available. Building server applications with "heavyweight" Java-based architectures, such as WebLogic, JBoss, and WebSphere, can be costly and cumbersome. When you've reached the point where you spend more time writing code to support your chosen framework than to solve your actual problems, it's time to think in terms of simplicity.  In <i>Better, Faster, Lighter Java</i>, authors Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland argue that the old heavyweight architectures are unwieldy, complicated, and contribute to slow and buggy application code.  As an alternative means for building better applications, the authors present two "lightweight" open source architectures: Hibernate--a persistence framework that does its job with a minimal API and gets out of the way, and Spring--a container that's not invasive, heavy or complicated.   Hibernate and Spring are designed to be fairly simple to learn and use, and place reasonable demands on system resources. <i>Better, Faster, Lighter Java</i> shows you how they can help you create enterprise applications that are easier to maintain, write, and debug, and are ultimately much faster.  Written for intermediate to advanced Java developers, <i>Better, Faster, Lighter Java</i>, offers fresh ideas--often unorthodox--to help you rethink the way you work, and techniques and principles you'll use to build simpler applications.  You'll learn to spend more time on what's important. When you're finished with this book, you'll find that your Java is better, faster, and lighter than ever before. </span>

                    <span>If you are interested in code, you will find very little in this book. If you are interested in the believes of the authors you get more than your share. The believes are not bad. In fact it is easy to agree with the authors at an 80% level. Also one finds some new thoughts. Still reading this book gives oneself a bad feeling. 
<br />
<br />Part of the reasons is easy to grasp. Writing three times how bad EJB is, is ok. But this opinion drops out of the entire book. It is much better to spend more of the audiences time with the good solutions and treat them real thoroughly.
<br />
<br />A signpost does not have to go the way it is indicating. Still for a book on good Java/Software qualities, it is necessary that the authors also do deliver on true quality. Better Java reads like a layman speaking about Zen Buddhism. You might not have to be a Zen master but without an experience of enlightment/satori it is difficult to meaningfully speak about Zen.

                    <span>This book seems to be an equal mix of pragmatic preaching and technical examples. The book makes sense, and if you're a person who thinks that J2EE applications are bloated, slow, and hard to maintain, then you'll love this book. Keep an open mind and take in what the authors are presenting.</span>

                    <span>This is a refreshing piece of work for the J2EE world that is rife with over-engineered non-performant complex applications.  Many Java books try to teach you the details of the J2EE specs, but provide you very little PRACTICAL guidance on how to use the technologies to write flexible, well-organized, and performant systems.  As an indepenent consultant/technical architect I have seen many different ways that clients have used the available J2EE specs to architect a Java application and so many times they get themselves into problems because they misused the technologies.  This book really caught my attention when I first picked it up because it cuts through a lot of the hype and provides a good framework on how to look at designing a good, practical application with Java.  Don't buy this book if you want to learn the details on how to use Spring or Hibernate, that's not what its for.  It provides strong guidance on how to use Java and then illustrates those ideas by providing an overview of Spring and Hibernate while applying these principles.  I think this is even more valuable because you walk away with the understanding of the principles and their application, which positions you to write your own framework that apply the philosophies or use these existing frameworks that follow this philosophy.  I also think that the book is very well written, well organized and, therefore, easy to follow.  </span>

                    <span>This book with its talk of the business "sponser" was not even spell checked. The code will not compile because in Java declarations are case sensitive. Whole paragraphs are repeated. The content is vague and seems to be more of a rant than an attempt to teach.

                    <span>It is a very nice book.  It is something that you would like to give to people who are into EJB most of their lives telling them its time to change. It's time to go to the gym and lose gallons of fat. 
<br />
<br />But if you are someone who really wants to know how things are done and how things work, I would not recommend this book. If you are into Hibernate, Spring, or other simpler frameworks or just want to learn these stuff, you don't need this book. Simply because you don't need a book that will only tell you what you already know; and that is, in java simple things are definitely not mediocre.
<br />
<br />In my humble opinion this book gives you an insight to the future of java development. This book prepares you on what is coming. But unfortunately it is not enough, far not enough, to gear you up for it. 
<br />
<br />But in fairness this is not really an "in-depth" kind of book so may I rate it the way it is.
