                    <span>Profit from live auctions, attract bids with clear and quick-loading images and attention-getting descriptions, and learn about reserves and 'buy it now' pricing with the aid of Greg Holden's How to Do Everything With Your eBay Business, a step-by-step resource which advocates using pro secrets to sell more successfully. There are other ebay books on the market, but this one clearly covers a wider range of basics than most, ranging from designing a sale to opening up your own Web store via ebay's system.</span>

                    <span>I consider myself moderately tech savvy and although I had a few eBay transactions under my belt as a buyer and seller, I found this book very informative. I bought this and the dummy book and I found this one more helpful. I keep going back to this one to lookup for tips and tidbits. This book emphasis is on those who want to sell full time on eBay and it touches all the bases from taking pictures, equipment needed, helpful software, and more. It also offers great links to eBay and other sites to help you out. I really enjoyed that he profiles several successful full time eBay sellers and their stories. It's great to hear from those who are making it. If your trying to become a full time eBay seller like me this book should be on your desk!</span>

                    <span>This book is the best Ebay book I have read and trust me I have read them all. I am an experienced EBAY POWER seller myself. I have been doing so for over 4 years now and have sold over 3000 items. Actually I am in the book, but trust me when I say this is the ONLY book you will need to buy to get started, or improve your EBAY expierence. Whether it is buying or selling and you are a beginner or experienced it will help everyone. It is a very easy to read and understand book. Overall the book hands down is better than EBAY for Dummies.</span>

                    <span>Although this book is more recent than the Dummies book of the same theme, it's clear that Holden is not an active seller on ebay. He stresses many things in the book, they do apply to home business, but a good deal does not apply to running a business on ebay. <P>I was inspired and learned much more by Starting an eBay Business for Dummies, than with this book. There seems to be a major difference when a book is written by someone who is both a writer and a successful eBay Power Seller (as is the case with the Dummies book).</span>
