                    <span>When you consider we now operate in a global economy, looking at just US demographcs is faulty. I am much more concerned about an ageing Chinese and Indian population than an ageing European and US population. Luckily the demographic bomb in Asia is farther away than that in the US and Europe, by some 20 years. It's implications are far worse however. In any event, one should look at global demographics rather than local demographics when analyzing macro-economic trends such as GDP growth rates.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The author is actually bullish on the markets from 2003-2011.  He then foresees a massive crash bigger and longer than what we experienced in the 1930s, as the demographic makeup of the West also collapses.  
<br />
<br />But like so many prognosticators, this one makes a big, tenuous assumption: that investors have NOT priced in the alleged precipitating event (demographics) and won't until it's too late.  It could be that the market already knows that our coming demographic decline and huge debt load will eventually constrain stock market returns.  That information might be discounted in current and future stock prices, and they therefore may never reach the heights the author forecasts they will before the Great Bust ensues.
<br />
<br />While I do expect a major bust within the next decade, it may not be as severe as the author thinks, precisely because people will be anticipating the trends he lays out.  In other words, while the Dow does seem likely to crash to 5,000, it may be from a top of around 15,000 rather than 30,000.  And instead of crashing after the precise demographic top in 2012, it might begin crashing much earlier, as our huge debts prematurely "age" the population and hamper our spending power, and investors begin to see the writing on the wall.  (I plan on turning bearish in 2008, when the first wave of Baby Boomers begin to retire.)
<br />
<br />You'd be taking a huge gamble by piling in to stocks now and planning to time your exit point based on this book or your expectation of a "bubble boom" to occur within some other author's time-frame.  If the stock market will ultimately be much lower than it is now, you'd be wise to build cash and accumulate gold coins now.  If you're more aggressive-minded and long-term oriented, use major market rallies as opportunities to ease your way into bear funds.</span>

                    <span>If you are into reading economic doom and gloom books, this will provide some interesting reading.  The Coming Generational Storm, The Party's Over, and The Dollar Crisis are all recommended if that is your cup of tea.
<br />
<br />The book pretty much maps a graph of the number of 49-year-olds over the years with the performance of the stock market.  The graphs do correlate well and suggest a good stock market until 2010-2012 when the market will crash.  There, I just told you the entire contents of the book.  It makes no mention about the dollar crisis, the energy crisis, or the generational crisis.

                    <span>It is hard to rate this book.  At only 54 pages, it is little more than a pamphlet really.  Still, this is all the space the author needed to make his point - and a very interesting point at that. It is hard to deny that his arguments have the ring of truth.  In his book, the author does not plug any financial services or related books or anything like that. This is not a sales pitch. In fact, much of what is in the book is free of charge on his website.
<br />
<br />I worry about his prediction that we will emerge from this depression around 2025.  With the peak oil situation, I wonder if we will EVER emerge again into a familiar world.  One way or another, the future is going to be tough, folks.  Books like this only ask you to be prepared.  Well worth reading.

                    <span>There certainly are a lot of serious issues with our financial system, but this and other books that claim a depression is inevitable are as likely wrong as right.   If you have been a student of this genre for a while you know that there are always books predicting doom and gloom.   Ravi Batra must have made millions in the 80s and early 90s selling books like this. Before him there were others.   The facts are that while we've had some pretty big reversals in the stock market we haven't seen anything like the Great Depression since then.   One can speculate we might, but it's only speculation.   (If you can't remember all the way back to Ravi Batra how about Y2K?) 
<br />
<br />So it could happen, but the reviewer who said "now I know there will be a depression", well I would humbly submit that, no, you don't know.  You may see some warning signs but the future is not easily predicted. 
<br />
<br />The market for "survive the coming crash" books however appears strong.  Perhaps this is an unstudied economic indicator? </span>
