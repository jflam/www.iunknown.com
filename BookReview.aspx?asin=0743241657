                <span id="Label1">Given the opportunity to watch the inner workings of his own brain, Steven Johnson jumps at the chance. He reveals the results in <I>Mind Wide Open</I>, an engaging and personal account of his foray into edgy brain science. In the 21st century, Johnson observes, we have become used to ideas such as "adrenaline rushes" and "serotonin levels," without really recognizing that complex neurobiology has become a commonplace thing to talk about. He sees recent laboratory revelations about the brain as crucial for understanding ourselves and our psyches in new, post-Freudian ways. Readers shy about slapping electrodes on their own temples can get a vicarious scientific thrill as Johnson tries out empathy tests, neurofeedback, and fMRI scans. The results paint a distinct picture of the author, and uncover general brain secrets at the same time. Memory, fear, love, alertness--all the multitude of states housed in our brains are shown to be the results of chemical and electrical interactions constantly fed and changed by input from our senses. <I>Mind Wide Open</I> both satisfies curiosity and provokes more questions, leaving readers wondering about their own gray matter. <I>--Therese Littleton</I></span>

                    <span>Let me begin by saying I read this book from cover to cover.  I'll also mention that I'm a grad student in neuroscience.  This book contained a few moderately interesting insights, but overall covered astonishingly little information.  It's so full of the author's anecdotes about who he met and how he came to his conclusions that it leaves little room for his actual theses.  It's a lot of flash and little substance.  It's definitely well-written though.  
<br />
<br />There are so many incredible things to learn about neuroscience that are accessible to non-scientists, yet he focused most of the book on electroencephalograms (EEG), which is ancient technology and alone yields little information about the brain.  He drew broad conclusions from specific data and consistently overinterpreted results.  This is not surprising considering he has no degree.  I should have noticed this before I bought the book.  He's like the Ken Burns of neuroscience.  You can't study neuroscience part-time for a year or two and expect to write a deep book on it.  It's like trying to fly a space shuttle after a summer internship at NASA.  
<br />
<br />So in conclusion, if you know nothing about neuroscience, you'll probably get something out of this book.  Don't waste your time on it though, because if you want to have your mind blown, read "The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat".

                    <span>I'm only a senior in high school, so I'm not incredibly knowledgable about... anything. But I've been interested in psychology for a while, and I saw this book. I read the first 8 pages and already I learned a ton. It just got better as I continued, and I actually took it on vacation because I couldn't put it down. My uncle actually saw me reading it and said he felt bad that I had to do homework on vacation, but I actually felt bad that he didn't want to read. It was far more enjoyable learning than any homework I've done, and it's juat amazing how much I've learned without any background at all in medical education. Great Book!</span>

                    <span>Johnson is a remarkable popular science writer, with a talent for language and metaphor comparable to that of  a very good novelist.  He is also very bright, objective, personable and does his research well.  Even when I was familiar with a particular subject area,  I learned a lot or understood things better.   While my background is better than some, this is a book accessible to all.  Johnson's objective for "Mind Wide Open" is to help the reader live a better life by providing the kind of understanding that leads to more aware self-examination - not the usual kind of objective for a popular science work.  I believe this objective, as well as Johnson's own enthusiasms, may have led him a little astray.  The chapters I liked least were on bio-feedback (Johnson is on the board of a bio-feedback company, as I learned from one of his footnotes), and functional brain imaging.  Both chapters centered on Johnson's personal experiences, not as a way to explain science, as elsewhere, but as some kind of personal adventure which is supposed to demonstrate the potential of these tools for generating self-awareness.  The rest of the book is so interesting, I really begrudge the loss of what could have been in 2 additional chapters.  Mind Wide Open is particularly strong in its discussion of  memory and emotions (fear, love) and on the role of the body's owns drugs, which cocaine and the like mimic.  As part of his summing up, Johnson has a wonderful discussion of how Freud can be updated to provide a modern theory of psychology.</span>

                    <span>This is such an enlightening straight forward book which will leave you mulling over these ideas of brain and self long after you have finished he last page.  Since we so often mistake knowing how to use our brains with actually understanding its working that it is easy to forget just how much we still don't yet fully understand about its hidden workings.
<br />
<br />No, this book does not live up to its title of `Mind Wide Open' in that it shines a light into every hidden area of the mind but that is part of the charm.  While heightening my understanding of the inner workings of the mind it still leaves a since of mystery- a foreshadowing of future research.  It is also important that Steven Johnson doesn't loose his since of wonder at the brains complexity while attempting to explain it.  There is still much room left for the reader to mouth the word "wow" upon reading a passage.
<br />
<br />The main problem of this book is that it makes me want to rush out and get thousands of dollars worth of scanning and testing done of my brain activity I think I will be able to fight off the impulses and settle for the insights that Mind Wide Open offers.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This delightfully well written book uses everyday English to explain an incredibly complicated subject. In his introduction, Johnson states the obvious - that most Neuroscience books assume a certain baseline knowledge of the brain which your average person lacks. He wants this to be an approachable book, so he keeps the technical terms to a minimum, always explaining them first and using real world examples of how they apply.
<br />
<br />Many scientists would criticize his methods - namely, using himself as his primary test subject. If he were trying to prove new science rather than explain information to a new audience, I would agree. Instead, I found his quest to understand the inner workings of his own brain fascinating. I found myself wondering what a fMRI would reveal about me, wondering what I'd learn from neurofeedback, wanting to try the various attention tests he describes, and wanting desperately to play computer games controlled by my own brain waves.
<br />
<br />In addition to being well written, I find this book well organized. Johnson starts with a broad introduction, a sort of guided tour of the brain. He then breaks the brain up into numerous modules, explains how those modules work individually and more important, how they work in concert with other brain modules. The end result is incredibly complex without any individual stops on the tour being overwhelming. 
<br />
<br />Unlike many pop science books, he doesn't try to lump people into distinct categories, instead opting to present everything as a set of overlapping spectrums. He furthermore suggests you have the power to change where you are on spectrums through conscious choice. Moving from one end to another might be wishful thinking, but becoming a little more this or a little less that just requires determination and work. 
<br />
<br />For me, the most significant parts of the book were the explanations of the autism spectrum and the facial expression reading skills. Johnson warns that after you learn a little about these, you'll find yourself analyzing your friends and family. That's very true. For the first time, I found myself capable of understanding and even enjoying the company of someone I know with Aspeger's. A little context made a world of difference.
<br />
<br />If you're not familiar with neuroscience, this book can have a real impact on how you perceive people around you - in my opinion, for the better. 
<br />
<br />I don't casually pick up books on neuroscience, so I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this one is. It's one I know I'll read again. I can't recommend it enough.</span>
