                    <span>This book clearly explains the foundation of cryptography, numbers, and the techniques that have emerged to provide modern security technologies. The book starts with Part I, that sets the context by introducing terms and the basics, including ciphers, data encryption standard (DES) and secret keys. The authors did a remarkable job by making complex concepts easy to understand. The next two parts go into more detail about public keys and digital certificates. While these are relatively simple to learn on the surface, the details have always eluded me until I read this book because more papers and books on the subject get too deep into details too fast and assume knowledge of advanced math on the part of the reader. Not so this book - the authors make it easy through clear writing, illustrations that illuminate the textual descriptions and a knack for explaining the complex in simple and easily digestible chunks.<P>I especially liked Part IV, which covers secure electronic commerce because it covered the full spectrum of technologies and the information is immediately useful to all IT and security professionals. Like in the first three parts of this book I came away with a complete understanding of how everything works.<P>This book epitomizes clear writing. Moreover, it is simply amazing how much knowledge can be relatively painlessly gained from reading this book. Although I am sure the authors intended to make the inner workings of cryptography accessible to non-security professionals (which they unquestionably accomplished), they also set a standard of excellence in technical writing by producing a book that is, in my opinion, near perfect in its ability to seamlessly use lively prose and well thought out illustrations to convey highly technical information. If you need to learn cryptography but are challenged by the math and the impenetratable writing of other books on the subject, start with this one.</span>

                    <span>* The title of H.X. Mel and Doris Baker's CRYPTOGRAPHY DECRYPTED is a<BR>bit misleading, implying that this is a book on general cryptography.<BR>This isn't exactly the case; while it does have a survey of the<BR>history of cryptography, it is actually focused on digital / Internet<BR>cryptography, explaining such matters as public-key cryptography,<BR>digital certificates, Internet security, and so on.<P>There is a great deal of very good information in this book, but it<BR>suffers from a certain lack of focus. It's basically set up as an<BR>introductory sort of book, but despite the attempts of the authors to<BR>simplify things for beginners, it comes across as a little too stiff<BR>and difficult for a novice. Crypto is of course difficult, but the<BR>authors just don't seem to have the ability to really make things<BR>simple. It reads much like the "typical computer sort of book".<P>I get the impression that they never really handed it to a real novice<BR>to see where the text gets a blank look. For example, I kept<BR>wondering what the difference is between a "MAC" and a "hashed MAC" --<BR>doesn't a MAC imply use of a hash, thinks I? -- but though I went<BR>over the text repeatedly I couldn't do more than guess in the end.<P>So I can only guardedly recommend this book. It's not really<BR>appropriate for a novice, but should be useful for an intermediate<BR>crypto fan interested in Internet cryptography -- with the conditions<BR>that it can be difficult to mine information out of it and that there<BR>are dead ends here and there.</span>

                    <span>If you have no idea how network security works than this is THE book for you! After reading several RFC's and other books and materials on topics such as IPSec, Diffie-Hellman, Message Digest,etc., and not REALLY understanding how they work, this book made it easy! The examples in the book are very simple- too simple to be used in the real world. But that's fine because once you understand the examples in the book, you can apply the concepts to real world stuff without being completely confused.<BR>Thank you Mel & Baker!</span>
