                <span id="Label1">Sports documentaries don't get any better than <I>The Last Game</I>, which seems likely to remain the greatest film ever made about the undiluted thrill of high school football. You couldn't write a Hollywood script better than this riveting, real-life celebration of Central Bucks West--the reigning champions of Pennsylvania high school football--and the team's passionate hard-ass coach of 32 years, Mike Pettine Sr. The year is 1999, and as CB West storms its way toward an astonishing, undefeated three-season record of 45-0, we witness the many facets of an unfolding drama: star fullback Dustin Picciotti rises to prominence with an abundance of cocky self-assurance; former CB West player-turned-rival coach Mike Pettine Jr. prepares to battle his father's team in a crucial game; and Pettine Sr. wrestles with the decision to retire after this, his 33rd season. It all culminates in a final championship contest during which Picciotti and two other valuable players are injured--an escalating sequence of events that's guaranteed to have you white-knuckled on the edge of your seat. Given the pure, non-professional nature of high school football, the raw energy of this low-budget, shot-on-video production, and the volatile personalities involved, <I>The Last Game</I> reflects the spirit of CB West: It's just about perfect. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I></span>

                    <span>Having played against C.B. West I know the dedication those players had for that great coach and that team. The tradition that team has develop over the past 30 years is breath taking! In 9th grade when USA Today ranked West #5 in the nation, and I first saw this team play, there was know way in the world you could have told me this was a high school team. The size, speed, and raw talent of those players were just unbelievable! West was just an unstoppable team all you could do was just watch in amazement. What a coach, Pettine was just top notch! Probably the best coach to ever coach the game at the high school level! What can I say about this movie! If you are any kind of sports fan get this movie! The lesson of football can be emulated to any game! Just go out and get this movie, it is truly amazing! Being a Pennsbury Guy! Go Falcons!(...)</span>

If you don't love football- you could still love this film because it centers on the drama of a family- a father and son who must play each other- as coaches of the #1 and #2 team in the state- and the wife and mother stuck in the middle.<P>This film got 4 stars from USA TODAY and was called "one of the best sports documentaries ever made" by the Los Angeles Times. Check their website if you don't believe me- www.TheLastGame.com<P>This is a rare, once in a lifetime movie- I am not exaggerating.<P>Get it! See it!
