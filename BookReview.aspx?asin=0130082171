                    <span>Very hard to read and understand. Each chapter has Learning Objectives and those LO's are referenced for the questions at the end. The problem is: inside the chapter there is no way to find out what the LO's are!!! Me and a friend tried to figure it out but it was almost impossible. A lot of the chapter questions were very difficult. Several spelling errors that a sixth grader could have found. I had a Managerial Accounting class twice, once as a prerequisite for my graduate degree and I am taking it now for my MBA. Imagine my horror when I discovered that I was using this same book twice. I hope you never get stuck with this turkey of a book.</span>

                    <span>A very nice and neat accounting textbook! This book explains basic accounting concepts clearly, which helps me to master basic concepts of accounting with ease and simplicity. I had a great time to read this book, and it makes learning accounting as interesting as it can be. The introduction and summary of each chapter also help me to understand a big picture of management accounting as well as small details. The treatment of management accounting is thorough and highly advanced with many detailed examples in reality.<br>The reason that I recommend this book is extending basic concepts with real-world examples which apples underlying concepts of management accounting. This book shows how accounting is used and analyzed in actual case situations. Especially I noticed that the authors are experts at the Balanced Scorecard. The Balanced Scorecard chapter presents the most important concept and examples in a very organized manner. This book also encompasses important new topics in management accounting such as activity-based cost systems, JIT, target costing, pricing and product planning, performance measurement systems, and budgets.<br>I heard some textbooks too much focus on questions of calculating cost and deriving quantitative solutions. Unlike those textbooks which only teach mechanical procedures without understanding underlying factors, this textbook provides insightful knowledge about how management accounting information facilitates decision- making through various analysis tools.</span>

                    <span>This book is terrible in addition to being ridiculously expensive ($108 to be exact).  I had to buy it for an MBA course in Managerial Accounting and found it to be extremely confusing, without structure and ambiguous.  There are numerous errors, omissions, and the examples are not clear at all.  It's really too bad such a poor text was chosen because I am certain that others, like myself, have been turned off of management accounting forever.  It's too bad because management accounting is such an integral part of business and deserves much better attention, and clarity than this book provides.  I can't wait to "try" to sell this one.  Definitely not a keeper!  If you have to buy this book for your course, I truly empathize with you.</span>

                    <span>I cant believe Professionals cant explain topics in a easy words. Trying to use grandma stories and without explaining where numbers come its impossible to understand.<p>1) explanations are not good at all very confusing if you are a beginner. <br>2) Examples are like grandma tale and will make you sleepy.<br>3) dull and boring.<br>4) the authors need to put them self in the students shoes rather than assuming they are teaching a CPA.<br>I would recommend Schaums Series or barrons series for learning, Its easy and also easy on your wallet...compared to this...</span>
