                    <span>I bought this book despite it's bad reviews and I must say that I am sorry I did. This book is very poorly written. I got only to chapter 3 and the examples have led me to debug to get them to work. Example, chapter 3 asks you to connect to an Access database (OleDB) with a SQL Object! No, no. It also in the same chapter references a view in the PROVIDED Access database off the disk named OrderTotals thats not even there! 
<br />
<br />I would have given this 0 stars, but it was not an option.</span>

                    <span>The book is full of typos, the test databases already have records you are supposed to add, and there are syntax errors galore. A proof reader would have been a plus to this book project. The C# examples blow up continually. I am surprised that Microsoft put there name on this. I am not crazy about debugging my own code. I resent paying for a book where I have to debug someone else's. I don't know if the problem is intensified if you are using Visual Studio 2003. If you are and you code in C#, stay away from this book, period. </span>

                    <span>I basically got this book for the main reason my text book for my course i am taking is not the best and is a little vague at times.
<br />Here's the thing, it is not like the other SBS books, the chapters (at least to me) seem out of order, for example, chapters 6 to 8 are relating the dataTables, dataViews, etc, after you are creating them.... Most the items that I feel are the basics are found after you go through a bunch of code that is unrelated. Luckily I do not feel this book is a complete waste of money; there are things that will make it a really good reference book, other then that, get something else if you are looking to learn. </span>

                    <span>The book for me basically killed 3 birds with one stone. I am an experienced database application developer, but not in vb.net, c#, or ado.net. I did the exercises both in vb.net and c#. As for the program bugs, annoying, but having to debug some of the programs just helped me learn the language syntax. As for the ado.net, not confusing, but would have like to see more details in the concepts/topics the chapters were trying to explain. Over all, the book for me was nice fast-track into the technology, but limiting in details.</span>

                    <span>I read the first five chapters and gave up.  The book is poorly writen and very difficult to follow.  Most of the samples have problems which leaves you spending the majority of your time debugging the code.  Many of the programs won't run with Option Strict on. I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone and yes, my copy is for sale.
