                <span id="Label1">Free yourself of allergies and asthma once and for all with Dr. Pescatore&#146;s breakthrough program    <P>" Dr. Fred Pescatore&#146;s The Allergy and Asthma Cure reveals a unique and revolutionary understanding of the underlying conditions of allergy and asthma&#150;from food triggers to the environment to nutritional deficiencies.  His integrative program of both alternative and traditional treatments can dramatically improve health and vitality, safely and soundly. This book will have a prominent place in my library and I highly recommend it! "<BR>    &#150;Ann Louise Gittleman, Ph.D., C.N.S., author of the bestselling The Fat Flush Plan    <P>"Conventional medicine has largely shrugged its shoulders in confusion about the causes of allergies and asthma in millions of people. In this book Dr. Fred Pescatore deals with the roots of these modern epidemics, drawing on his clinical experience, and he provides clear recommendations for turning back the tide and restoring health."<BR>    &#150; Jack Challem, author of the bestselling Syndrome X and The Inflammation Syndrome    <P>"The Allergy and Asthma Cure is the book we have all been waiting for. Dr. Pescatore manages, in a concise manner, to summarize all the facts and presents a comprehensive healing guide that incorporates both conventional and alternative approaches. A must-read for those dealing with these issues."<BR>    &#150;Artur Spokojny, M.D., F.A.C.C., Medical Director of Integrative Medicine of Manhattan, Associate Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College    <P>"I believe that The Allergy and Asthma Cure holds the key to understanding how nutritional medicine can really work for you. Allergies (from skin conditions to seasonal types) and asthma can be cured, not just held at bay.  This book shows the way.  Dr. Pescatore is truly a healer."<BR>    &#150;Roberta Flack, singer/songwriter    <P>"I have seen firsthand how The Allergy and Asthma Cure has changed people&#146;s lives for the better.  I have started using his treatment protocols for my own patients with a remarkable success rate, and best of all with no side effects.  Many of my patients are getting off their allergy and asthma medications completely.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone with allergies or asthma."<BR>    &#150;Dana G. Cohen, M.D., board-certified, Internal Medicine    <P>"This book is for anyone willing to give up his or her life as an asthmatic. I had tried every drug and treatment available and the asthma only got worse. Under Dr. Pescatore&#146;s care, I began to see results within six weeks. It&#146;s been over two years now living without an attack. His approach has changed the way I live."<BR>    &#150;Paul Goldman, patient    </span>

                    <span>I had been getting more and more allergic every year. Last year I developed asthma, and kept up with an intense schedule by using inhalers, a lot! Even though I gave up dairy and wheat, they continued to get worse, finally to the point where I had hives and welts from touching my books (a little microscopic mold, I suppose). That was the last straw and I bought this book and followed it for 3.5 months now. I went from using inhalers 3 times a day to 0. I can hug my cats again, where I would cough when they walked into the room with me before. I had some patches of eczema on the elbows that is gone, and I finally have some get up and go again.<P>If you feel despair of having your body literally self destruct with allergic reactions, follow this program with ALL of the pertinent supplements (3 handfuls a day for me), and get your health back!</span>

                    <span>As a clinical nutritionist, I all too often see chronic suffering and serious secondary problems when patients use a strictly pharmaceutical approach to managing allergies and asthma. As Dr. Pescatore so clearly describes, the smarter approach is to look for and correct the imbalance that caused or is at least aggravating the problem. When the body is in balance, the need for medication is reduced or even eliminated. There is so much practical information and even emotional support in this book that it will be assigned homework for any of my clients who have allergy or asthma.</span>

                    <span>I've had all sorts of allergies for as long as I can remember. I was resigned to just live with them, until I read Dr. Pescatore's book, The Allergy and Asthma Cure. The prospect of abating my annoying, sometimes debilitating, allergies by adjusting my diet is thrilling. This book is easy to read and the recipes I've tried are delicious. I can't wait to try them all.</span>

                    <span>I first read about treating children for allergies and asthma in Dr. Pescatore's first book, "Feed Your Kids Well". As a physician, I implemented many of his ideas in my practice and found remarkable results. Literally, people's lives were changed. This book goes more in depth to treat people of all ages, and if you suffer from allergies of asthma, it can change your life as well.</span>
