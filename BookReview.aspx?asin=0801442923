                <span id="Label1">Francis Fukuyama famously predicted "the end of history" with the ascendancy of liberal democracy and global capitalism. The topic of his latest book is, therefore, surprising: the building of new nation-states. The end of history was never an automatic procedure, Fukuyama argues, and the well-governed polity was always its necessary precondition. "Weak or failed states are the source of many of the world&#146;s most serious problems," he believes. He traces what we know&#151;and more often don&#146;t know&#151;about how to transfer functioning public institutions to developing countries in ways that will leave something of permanent benefit to the citizens of the countries concerned. These are important lessons, especially as the United States wrestles with its responsibilities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond.   <P>Fukuyama begins State-Building with an account of the broad importance of "stateness." He rejects the notion that there can be a science of public administration, and discusses the causes of contemporary state weakness. He ends the book with a discussion of the consequences of weak states for international order, and the grounds on which the international community may legitimately intervene to prop them up.</span>

                    <span>Francis Fukuyama's newest book, State Building, while well written and insightful as one would expect from a scholar of his caliber, feels rather like a patchwork quilt at times.  It is unclear at times whether the book is written for an academic audience or for a more general audience, and while in the end I would recommend it for either, the general reader would be well advised to read carefully and ask lots of questions regarding some of the fine points of industrial organization theory and their application to Fukuyama's final goal of explaining the art of state-building in the 21st century.  
<br />
<br />While the index indicates that the book has four primary sections, in reality there are just three sections, the four is comprised of simply of a summary and conclusion.  In the first section Fukuyama covers the basics of political economy.   Most of his time in covering the basics of political economy is spent clarifying the difference between the scope of government power and the strength of government power, and while this is a well-known distinction to be drawn to most academics, fewer of the general readers may be familiar with it.  The remainder of this section is devoted to explaining the importance of institutions, both native and imported, to all aspects of applied political economy.  Fukayama covers a great deal of ground in this section, but he does an admirable job of covering the ground effectively.  
<br />	
<br />The second section of the book is devoted to a much more academic analysis of the problems of institutions and institutional design.  In this section in particular general readers would likely struggle.  The topics approached are not easy nor intuitive, and while the first section does lay a reasonable groundwork for understanding them, an individual approaching them for the first time through this book is likely to be either confused, bored, or both.  This problem is particularly acute when Fukuyama slips into the realm of corporate organization and the role of CEOs in developing the corporate culture because the connection to his primary thesis is one recognized by social scientists, but not always by the general public.  That said, his eventual conclusion that institutions matter but cannot just be imposed, like the Washington Consensus, is both accurate and important to understand.  His explanation, that culture and history really matter, while not as complete or rigorous as one would ideally hope for, is plausible.
<br />	
<br />The final section of State-Building deals with a more political and less economic topic, a justification for the very act of state-building.  In my opinion this is the most interesting section of the book because it provides a very interesting perspective on a topic that has never really been resolved, the issue of the power and foundations of legitimate statehood.  Fukuyama's analysis is as strong here as anywhere else in the book, perhaps stronger, and it is more than accessible to the average reader (or at least the average reader of non-fiction books).  
<br />
<br />My Two Cents:
<br />As much as I would like to believe that there is a simple answer to the questions raised, that given facts of the world X, Y, and Z then sovereignty should/should not be protected, or that institutional design X/Y is the absolutely efficient one, I agree with Fukuyama that our current state of knowledge is simply insufficient to make such judgements.  While Fukuyama seems to be holding out hope that one day we will know enough to make such decisions, I am more skeptical.  The world is not a static place, it is constantly changing, what is true now will not be true in a month, let alone a year or more.  With such a rapid change in the facts of the world, I do not believe that answers on statehood and institutional design will ever be truly answered, all we can do is to discuss what we think we know, debate the options that we believe we have, and to try to not be too surprised when we're wrong.  We can only hope that people like Francis Fukuyama will continue to be involved in the process and to make such contributions as they can.

                    <span>Fukuyama will probably always be identified by  the title of his first book---The End of History and the Last Man---but as this book demonstrates, he has moved on to tackle some of the most difficult problems facing our country  today.  This book,  which is really a long essay , analyzes the problems and opportunities of state building, and reaches some conclusions which are not particlarly optimistic, but nevertheless seem to be  realistic.  Fukuyama revisits some of our past experiences in  similar endeavors, and notes our failures as well as  the limited successes we have had.  This book should be required reading by  all decision makers  as our nation struggles to overcome our mistakes and failures in the aftermath of the Iraqi War.  It is an excellent, even great book, written by a brilliant scholar in language  which is easily grasped and appreciated.  </span>

                    <span>															Less government is to be preferred as a rule, however when no societal or cultural constructs or traditions exist to provide a framework for organized positive behavior, governmental organizations are to be preferred to chaos. In many areas of the world the infrastructure is not able to cope with either the problems facing the population or the volume of help offered by the relief agencies. The situation is further complicated by the imposition of aid structures by the relief agencies that compete with the existing frameworks for available resources.  According to Fukuyama , keeping civil society from degenerating into simple rent-seeking interest groups is dependent more on the nature of that civil society than the design of its institutions. 						   	The Westphalian model of the nation-state implying state sovereignty has been challenged many times in the pursuit of humanitarian objectives. It is unreasonable to accept the breach of sovereignty for humanitarian reasons, but not to prevent security threats, implying that defense of others is more legitimate than self-defense. Fixing this problem leads to the physical intervention in other states and the reform of their governments in order to eliminate them as a threat and prevent new threats from emerging. This is nation-building.										Nation-building , to be effective , must create state services that can be effective after foreign support is withdrawn. Successful examples have been Germany and Japan after WWII due to strong bureaucratic populations that survived the disruption of war and occupation. Other examples are India, Singapore and Hong Kong, for the British, Taiwan and Korea for the Japanese. Fukuyama stresses the need for international aid organizations to make structural capacity building their primary concern rather than simple short-term crisis solving
<br />             He is not optimistic since aid organizations or any other interested constituencies want to show quantifiable results to justify their efforts. Due to their competitive advantages, aid organizations marginalize locals and reduce the effectiveness of existing societal chiefs. The result is non-sustainability of their structures. Sustainability is still the goal and should be attempted.									That being said, empowering local organizations at the lowest level possible to implement the policies is recommended as is the clear statement of organizational policies and objectives throughout the organization. Fukuyama further favors the use of small NGOs who can be more efficient than governments to implement policy and can make more effective use of local knowledge. The overall goals of state-building should be to create self-sustaining structures that can maintain order, security, accountability, education, and the rule of law.									Finally Fukuyama contrasts the European universalist world view with that of Americans. He says that Europeans see the state as a guardian of public interest separate from and superior to the views of the citizenry. They see international or collective bodies (like the EU) as having legitimacy superior to their individual components. They also justify laws embodying social policy as expressions of social objectives. Americans do not. The American view is that unachievable social aspirations made into law weaken the rule of law itself. They also see no legitimacy of governments beyond the constitutional democratic nation-state. In this view international organizations have legitimacy only if and as long as duly elected majorities grant it. Only states can aggregate and deploy legitimate power. Fukuyama concludes: the withering away of the state is not Utopia, but disaster. 									Once again, as in his "The End Of History And The Last Man" Fukuyama has produced an erudite, compelling, and controversal book that no student of modern history should miss.

                    <span>This book about state building is based on very actual world affairs. You only have to think about Afghanistan and Iraq to see the West struggle with it. But when you read this book, it also becomes clear how little we know about how we organize our own societies.
<br />
<br />The book starts by describing the role of the state in two dimensions: the scope and the strength. After exploring the consequences and historical facts he comes to a convincing conclusion that it is not so much the scope (size) of the state that is important but the strength of the state. The more strength a state has, the more effective is in playing its role in providing safety and prosperity to the people it is serving. This is quite a refreshing idea, as most emphasis nowadays is mostly on smaller (vs. bigger) state power instead of stronger (vs. weak) state power.
<br />
<br />Also the book explores the management and economic theories and comes to the conclusion that there is no blue print that will give us the best practices to operate government institutions. Because institutions depend heavy on culture and local conditions and hence need to be developed in the local context. As Fukuyama argues the best thing to do is to develop best practices that help to grow institutions in a local context.
<br />
<br />In the later part of the book he also explains the difference in politics between Europe and the US. In my opinion he quite convincingly explains some failing European policies and some totalitarian tendencies in Europe, who tend to place the interest of the state above the interest of the people living in it.
<br />
<br />All in all an enlightening read, that binds current affairs with a deeper understanding of our own Western society.
