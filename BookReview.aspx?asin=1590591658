                    <span>One of the few comprehensive actionsctipt titles on the market. The first half of the book boasts a large variety of tutorials and examples that skillfully lead the reader through both the syntax and use of actionscript. Personally I found the text clear and practical. The chapters on OOP were of particular value as they went beyond actionscript basics into application, bordering on philosophical.
<br />
<br />The second half is an invaluable reference of the entire actionscript dictionary with a comprehensive CD full of .fla example files and bonus chapters on the XML Object. As a qualified teacher I found it hard to fault the methodology employed by the various authors.
<br />
<br />Well worth the purchase.</span>

                    <span>I am a former programming teacher and I have a style to teach my students the most UNDERSTANDABLE way to do something not just how to do it.  This text/reference achieves that purpose.  If you have an understanding of Flash (which you should have before getting into scripting see Weinman books) then this book will serve you well.  There are other books on scripting - great books - such as Moock's books but they are more so for the programmer.  This book is for the novelist programmer that desires to learn about action scripting.</span>

                    <span>5 stars if you know Flash well.<br>1 star if you haven't had any experience with it at all.<p>I was a beginner once, who couldn't figure out Flash at all. I'd like to help you build a bridge between where you may be now, as a beginner, to where you may find yourself aspiring to go.<p>If your only experience with Flash is to have seen the many wonderful and breathtaking Flash movies on the Internet and just had a look at the authoring tool, I strongly recommend that you leave this book until much later. It has its place in the learning curve but it isn't, in my opinion, the first book to see.<p>There are understandings to possess that this book doesn't cover sufficiently well enough for those whose minds work in particular ways. This is a programming book, for using the phenomenon of programming to create great design and animations. Whilst the focus is on design, you aren't using the design tools on the interface. With this book, you are using the Actionscript language and you have to have a logical mind for this activity (as well as keeping your strong creative one).<p>I began my steep learning curve with Flash by watching others and watching video tutorials, especially those by George Pierson. In this way, I can ask questions that are tailored for me and I get tailored responses. Books aren't always able to do so well here.<p>What is great about this book is the MX Actionscript reference in it and the seemingly well designed theory tutorials. I can't find a fault with the reference. The theory is quite good. In the reference, all Flash MX commands are covered. There are examples of how to use them, but the coverage may not be enough for some. Brill. Just BRILL. I can be excited but because I can follow Actionscript.<p>Approach this book when you are successfully making Flash movies on your own. Yes, on your own. For me, this book is an aid for when I am going to where I haven't gone to before. It  helps me make judgements on ideas I get.</span>

                    <span>I cannot say enough about this book.  I, like most programmers, have a stack of computer books that's taller than I am, but this one is by far the best one I've ever seen.  The ActionScript reference has entries that you can't find other places, including deprecated functions/operators and functions/objects that Macromedia doesn't tell anyone about.  Each and every function, operator, symbol, etc. has an explanation and several examples, including how NOT to use it.  Best of all, the entire reference is on CD, complete with text, images, and example files.  I keep mine in my CD drive at all times when working with Flash.<p>This book doesn't stop there, though.  It also has 20 chapters (3 on the CD) that discuss various aspects of ActionScript programming.  These are all clearly written and easy to read.  I would not say they are suitable for absolute beginners, but anyone with some programming experience in any language should be able to get a lot out of them.<p>The bottom line?  If you use Flash MX and you don't have this book, you're not getting all you can out of your ActionScript.</span>

                    <span>I started with Macromedia's Flash MX ActionScripting Advanced and I learned a lot. However, it does not contain a complete dictionary. I bought John Davey's book and in addition to the complete dictionary in the book, it is also on the CD. I keep the online version loaded when programming Flash. Furthermore, the 400+ pages of tutorials, are simple, plentiful, and each one illustrates one learning objective. Both books are good, but this one is better.</span>
