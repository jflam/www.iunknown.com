                    <span>I do not know how I can emphasize this point any more, this is the best book on Visual Basic programming ever written. Francesco's understanding of Visual Basic is amazing. While I have worked with and programmed with Visual Basic for years, there are few times I open this book and do not learn something new.<P>Even more important to me is Francesco's ability to put complex things into plain and understandable English. He has a gift for writing about programming that is rarely seen. His coverage of the intrinsic controls alone is worth the price of admission, yet that is only one small facet on this diamond of a book.<P>There are other books which cover more esoteric Visual Basic topics better, but no book covers the entire language as well as this one does. It is the true "Programmer's Guide" to the language. "Programming Visual Basic 6.0" is not for the beginner as it is pretty advanced in some places, but it is accessible to programmers of all levels as a reference and to mid-range programmers wanting to improve what they have learned in the beginning books. For advanced VB programmers this book again is a good reference though I can imagine even the seasoned veterans of us will find some new gems in these pages.<P>Rock On Francesco! You are incredible!</span>

                    <span>Francesco Balena has written the definitive book for existing and new VB programmers! The author has distilled his very great technical knowledge of VB, very pleasing writing style, and tremendous feel for organization and presentation to create a gem of a programming text. A VB book with no equal and no substitute, it is a true classic. I wish there were a category higher than 5 stars!<BR>FOR C/C++, Java (or even Cobol) programmers wanting an intelligent introduction to VB: DON'T LOOK ELSEWHERE! This single book will quickly teach you VB without insulting your intelligence.<BR>FOR Programming Novices: Hey guys, don't start your journey on the trash-laden "made easy" paths; don't be misled by the tons of rubbish promising to get you there in 24 hours, a week, or whatever. Pick up this serious programming guide, slog a bit, and you will surely get there.<BR>Thank you Mr Balena. Yours was the BEST computer book that I read in three years.</span>

                    <span>I am totally new to V.B. and am attempting to write a fairly complex application straight off. EVERY time I have been stuck I have refered to this book and it has so far always helped me out. As a beginner I do not always immediatly grasp the code samples, but after searching through some more basic texts then returning to this book, I have so far always got the results I am aiming for. It is almost as though the author has looked at what i am trying to do, then sat down and written an example or two of how I can accomplish it! <P>If I could only recommend one VB 6 book, this would be it. Great stuff.</span>

                    <span>This is mother of all books on VB6! Balena is trully amazing in delivering a hands-on coverage of Visual Basic programming. I have read quite a few books on VB6, but this one is my favorite.<BR>If you're planning to do some serious programming, you owe yourself a copy. And if you find it difficult to spend $30 to get one, you can always go to VB2THEMAX.COM for plenty of free code, tips, tricks and all.</span>

                    <span>I have practically worn this book out over the past two years, referring to it on a near-daily basis as I have developed a comprehensive application from start to finish. The ultimate VB reference manual, the author gives you lots of tips and tricks to make your code more powerful and efficient. As others have said, this book is not for beginners. But if you have a little experience with VB, it will quickly take you to the advanced level.</span>
