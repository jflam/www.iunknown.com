                    <span>We had the pleasure of Craig Larman's presence for 2 days here in Melbourne Australia. Craig conducted a seminar on UP/AGILE/SCRUM etc and the EVIDENCE for its use. He also took us through a practical exercise based on his "UML and Patterns" book as well - another great read...<P>Boy - did he switch on some lights as to why you should use AGILE rather than WATERFALL development.<P>I am now the proud owner of both his books (personally signed! as well).<P>The 2 days were fantastic. The books are even better - complementing each other with lots of examples and stating actual scientific facts. I am now busy trying to read "Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide" on the train and the like. <P>The book will be a great aid in helping you change mindset of management so do yourself a favour - grab a copy for yourself and one for the boss!!<P>You will not be disappointed.<P>Mark Bourne</span>

                    <span>If ever there is a book that should be part of a college-level software engineering curriculum as well as carefully read by software engineering development and project managers this is it. Every major iterative development methodology is covered in complete detail, with an emphasis on Agile methods, and a solid business and technical case is provided for the general approach.<P>Why make a case for? As difficult as it may be to believe, the waterfall method is still prevalent despite the large body of literature on rapid, iterative development SDLCs. Indeed, I have worked in environments that claimed to embrace the RUP as the enterprise methodology in principle, yet in practice projects were planned and managed using the waterfall SDLC. Why the disconnect? Managers were set in their ways and had no true understanding of the mechanics or value of Agile and iterative development methods.<P>This book can change that because each major approach is carefully described using the following format for easy comparison and to clearly show strengths and weaknesses:<BR>Method Overview<BR>Lifecycle<BR>Workproducts, Roles, and Practices<BR>Values<BR>Common Mistakes and Misunderstandings<BR>Sample Projects<BR>Process Mixtures<BR>Adoption Strategies<BR>Fact versus Fantasy<BR>Strengths versus "Other"<P>More importantly, these approaches are placed in the context of the benefits of incremental delivery, with clearly presented evidence of the benefits, which is provided in Chapter 6.<P>Regardless of biases or preferences, any objective reader will come away with a clear sense of the meaning of 'Agile' and the power and value of iterative development. You will also come away with a good frame of reference with which to compare your own organization's approach to development and delivery, and how to improve it.</span>

                    <span>This is the best book I have ever read about modern software development methodologies. I never really understood the difference between the UP (Unified Process) and the RUP (Rational Unified Process) before I read this book. Now I understand the differences very well. I also didn't really have a good understanding of the main iterative methodologies: Scrum, XP, UP, and Evo. I had heard and read a little about all of these methodologies, but until I read this book, I didn't realize how little I knew. If you would like to learn more about agile and iterative development and how it compares to the traditional waterfall software development methodology, you need to buy this book. Also, if you are having trouble getting your management team to buy in to agile and iterative software development, buy this book. It will give you all of the ammunition you need to convince them.</span>

                    <span>During the spring semester 2004, I am teaching a course in software engineering. As a major class project, we are developing an application that will scan C/C++ code looking for potential security problems. In my opinion, there is only one way that a class of this type can develop a project of any significance. That is using an agile/iterative development model, where there is a little design, a little coding, a little testing and then go back to design. When I taught software engineering last spring, we used the same model, but were not as agile. Our iterations were longer and we pushed some of the more difficult tasks to the end. As the students noted, "we coded carefully at the start, but then just wanted to get it done at the end." <BR> While this scenario might seem to be a problem, I found it gratifying, because it is just like the real world. The authors of this book are also firmly set in the world of software development. While reading it, I was constantly saying to myself, "It is about time." The reason for this singular conversation was that they completely disrespect the waterfall model of software development. In retrospect the use of the waterfall model is similar to the strict use of the word engineering in software development. Namely, the beliefs that the practice of building software development is just like building a bridge or a building. By thinking that all of the parameters can first be determined and then you build the software, an enormous amount of time, effort and expense had been wasted. Software development is a very dynamic process, one where circumstances are in a constant state of oscillation that gets damped down to a limit point as the project nears completion. <BR> The waterfall model is one that is implicitly taught in school as well, but the only way we get away with it is because most of the programs that students write are small, well within the bounds of having hard parameters. Therefore, it is possible to completely design the program before coding it. In my experience with students fresh out of college, the two concepts they have the most difficulty with in their first job is the constantly changing requirements and the fact that they will know only a small part of the complete application they are building. And so, all educators must place more emphasis on dealing with changing requirements, and this book is an excellent place to start.<BR> Fortunately, the movement towards object-oriented programming and encapsulation has made the change to iterative development easier. A programmer no longer has to be as concerned about possible data and method interactions/conflicts as they had to be when everything was visible to all. <BR> I was sold on the iterative method of software development over a decade ago, when I started a job as a software developer. We were building a new product and received changing requirements on a weekly and sometimes almost daily basis. Quite frankly, we had no choice but to adopt an agile development style. I wish I had had this book with me at that time, it would have saved us a lot of stumbling around as we tried to deal with everything.</span>

                    <span>"Agile and Iterative Development" is a 'must read' for anyone involved in leading, managing, or doing software development. I have been using iterative methodologies for many years. Despite this, not only did I learn many things I did not know about the process, but it also gave me very useful information and statistics on the benefits of using it that I found useful when defending the approach against more traditional waterfall methodologies. Most interesting is discussions on practical applications when dealing with customers/clients that expect waterfall - a problem I have been dealing with for a long time. I bought several copies to distribute to my staff and I even refer to it in my resume where I discuss my ideal development approach.<BR>This book was read and re-read with enthusiasm - it sits deservedly on my classics shelf next to Brook's Mythical Man Month.
