                <span id="Label1">"The great book of nature," said Galileo, "can be read only by those who know the language in which it was written. And this language is mathematics."  <P>In <I>The Language of Mathematics</I>, award-winning author Keith Devlin reveals the vital role mathematics plays in our eternal quest to understand who we are and the world we live in. More than just the study of numbers, mathematics provides us with the eyes to recognize and describe the hidden patterns of life--patterns that exist in the physical, biological, and social worlds without, and the realm of ideas and thoughts within.  <P>Taking the reader on a wondrous journey through the invisible universe that surrounds us--a universe made visible by mathematics--Devlin shows us what keeps a jumbo jet in the air, explains how we can see and hear a football game on TV, allows us to predict the weather, the behavior of the stock market, and the outcome of elections. Microwave ovens, telephone cables, children's toys, pacemakers, automobiles, and computers--all operate on mathematical principles. Far from a dry and esoteric subject, mathematics is a rich and living part of our culture.  <P>A brilliant exploration of an often woefully misunderstood subject <I>The Language of Mathematics</I> celebrates the simplicity, the precision, the purity, and the elegance of mathematics.</span>

                    <span>Devlin: "The particular topics I have chosen are all central themes within mathematics... But the fact is, I could have chosen any collection of seven or eight general areas and told the same story; That mathematics is the science of patterns, and those patterns can be found anywhere you care to look for them, in the physical universe, in the living world, or even in our own minds. And that mathematics serves us by making the invisible visible."<br>At this writing it has been more than a few years since my last class in mathematics. But I liked math as a student and still do, even at the point that notation and degree of abstraction begins to hurt my head, so to speak, I still like it. There is a solidity and a beauty in mathematics that eclipses the empirical sciences. It is not only the practical applicability, logical purity, and beauty of mathematics that interest me, it is also its very immateriality. As Devlin states, "music exists not on the printed page, but in our minds. The same is true for mathematics; the symbols on a page are just a representation of the mathematics."<br>This is a wonderful book. Before 1900, mathematics could be wholly categorized within about a dozen subjects. While advances are still being made in some of these older disciplines -- Devlin discusses how developments in number theory are being applied to encryption for such purposes as banking security -- there are now at least 60-70 somewhat distinct disciplines of mathematics. The author reveals the logical foundations, history, and current applications of number theory, mathematical logic, the calculus, relativistic geometry, topology, and probability. Applications of mathematics to such seemingly far-flung fields as linguistics, electrodynamics, and astrophysics are briefly but aptly considered. He introduces us to the patterns and progressions of perceptive minds, from the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Peripatetics, to Pascal and Penrose, with glances at Galileo, Gauss and Godel. [Okay, enough alliteration ... just having a little fun with patterns; and patterns, as Devlin instructs, is precisely what mathematics is all about.]</span>

                    <span>This book is an incredible account into the ideas of mathematics. Devlin presents simple and extremely abstract ideas into a language that just about anyone can understand. Although some previous knowledge of the fields investigated does help, this book serves as a great introduction into such things as perspective geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, network theory, topology and quantum mechanincs. It also provides some great insights into the history and uses of number theory, algebra, geometry and calculus. I've have never read a mathematical/scientific work that was written with such passion and was a complete page turner (I read it straight over the course of 3 days). I am still amazed on how such a work can be under $50 because it is worth much more than that.</span>

                    <span>Keith Devlin is one of the best popular mathematics writers around, and this is one of his best works.  The eight chapters cover number theory, set theory, calculus, group theory, topology, probability and the application of mathematics to the physical world.  The discussion in each chapter, couched generally in English, not mathematics, is so clear that a math-phobic can understand it.  By the end of each chapter a great deal of fascinating mathematics has been described, and in some cases the formal basis is sketched--but the emphasis is always on narration, and a lay reader who doesn't even want to understand mathematics can still read this and get a sense of the dramatic history of mathematics.<p>Devlin states at the end that he decided to exclude many areas of mathematics in order to focus more effectively on what he did cover. As a result there is little or no coverage of chaos theory, game theory, catastrophe theory, or a long list of other topics.  The fact is there will always be holes in a book this size--mathematics has expanded so much in the last hundred years that even a book ten times this size could barely survey it.  The decision to focus was a good one, and the subjects chosen are good: the truly exciting stories are here: Archimedes, Fermat, Gauss, Galois, Riemann, Wiles, and many more.<p>Potential purchasers should note, by the way, that this book was reworked from Devlin's "Mathematics: The Science Of Patterns".  In Devlin's words (not from either book): "The Language of Mathematics is a restructuring of Science of Patterns that omits most of the color illustrations (a minus) but has two new chapters covering topics not in Science of Patterns (a plus). If you want lots of color, go for patterns; Language of Mathematics covers more ground."  I've read both, and I have to say they're both worth getting.  The two new chapters in this book are the ones on probability and the applications of mathematics in science; they're well done and interesting.  However, the pictures in Science of Patterns are very high quality.<p>They're both fine books, and I can strongly recommend each of them.  If you have to get one, I'd say get Science of Patterns.  Even though Language of Mathematics does have some colour plates, Science of Patterns is really a gorgeous book to read with many good illustrations.  I ended up buying both, and you may end up doing that too.</span>

                    <span>Devlin truly makes the 'invisible' 'visible' in his excellent treatment of the field of mathematics.  Each chapter is a masterpiece in itself and supports Devlin's theses regarding the nature of mathematics: mathematics as the study of the patterns of number and counting; of motion; of reasoning; of chance; and of closeness and position.  Perhaps read this book after reading Hardy's short essay, "A Mathematician's Apology", in order to fully appreciate the beauty involved.</span>

                    <span>Most people either misunderstand what math is all about, or see it as a collection of rather disjointed areas collected together under a single  name. Devlin does an admirable job of re-educating us all, and showing how  the different areas of mathematics are linked together, often in rather  surprising ways.<p>This book is simply brilliant. The amount of information  Devlin has managed to cram between two covers is amazing. Having spent  years studying this stuff, it's rather depressing to see that most of the  important things I've learned can fit into a 350 page book, but then this  is surely a testament to Devlin's skill.<p>Although this book makes no  formal educational expectations of the reader, I feel that a true beginner  would have trouble following a lot of parts, although they would still get  the general idea. This would be better then nothing, but I think that this  book would be best appreciated by those with some formal math background. I  would be curious to see what a high school student would make of this,  since I really wish I'd had this book back then. When you see the beautiful  ways that mathematics connects the most seemingly disparate ideas, you  can't help but want to learn more!</span>
