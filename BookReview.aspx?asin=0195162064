                    <span>This book was a wonderful find.  I read it in two days on a business trip and found the writing style enjoyable, the research accurate and detailed while not at all overbearing, and the information very interesting.  There are still very little details of the Lincoln's day to day activities at the Soldier's Home.  None of the Lincoln's kept diaries and official documentation of purchases, visitors, and happenings were very casual compared to the entourage and details which follow a modern day president on vacation. But the author uncovered letters and diaries of the soldiers and visitors who were around the Lincoln's at this time and from these sources has discovered a wealth of information.  The book parallels each of the decisive war time decisions made by Lincoln, and shows how his daily commute to the Soldiers Home from the White House and back, and the relaxing time spent with his family during summer nights and weekends, helped to shape some of his actions and achievements.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about Lincoln the person, with an interest in his politics and Civil War presidency.  This book is a wonderful addition to the new writings on the Sixteenth President.       </span>

                    <span>This book provides new information about Lincoln and his family, which is highly unusual for someone as researched as Lincoln.  Based on letters and recollections of the people who saw him there, this book gives a picture of Lincoln in robe and slippers away from the chaos of the war time White House.  A definate addition to what is known about Lincoln.</span>

                    <span>This is a well written book and very timely as action is being taken to renovate the Lincoln Cottage.  I reside on the grounds of the Soldiers' Home where the cottage is located and know the value of the cottage in our history. The facility is now known as the Armed Forces Retirement Home-Washington. The cottage has always been known as the Anderson Cottage.</span>
