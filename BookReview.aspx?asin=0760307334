                    <span>While my son is pictured in the book in his capacity as an STS operator, there's only so much he can tell me without violating his security clearance. He cannot discuss with whom he operates, where he's going/been or what he's done. However, from what he has been able to say, this book is right on. It's been my window to his world. The multiple skill sets they possess, the types of operations conducted, and the the levels of dedication and courage they display are amazing. There names and faces will only be known after something went wrong. Read it! Believe it!</span>

                    <span>This book is very informative to anyone looking to get into the world of Air Force Special Tactics Teams. Allows you to see what the jobs are of these brave individuals, and what you must endure during the riggors of earning the title of combat controller or a "pj". Although I do believe the past standards in this book are the older ones and they have been changed.</span>

                    <span>Kudos to Mr. Pushies for his in-depth analysis of the US Air Force Special Ops. Reading the book, the reader can only tell that this book was a passion for Mr. Pushies to write. The subject matter itself was in need of a publication detailing its merits.</span>

                    <span>Finally a book on everything about PJ's and CCT from their extensive training, the pipeline, to future mission profiles. Better, more in-depth info than I have ever found on the net. But this is just half of this book. If your looking for info about the planes, helos, jets and their capabilities this is the book you're looking for</span>

                    <span>I have read every book on Air Force Special Ops, and by far this is the most current and illistrative. While the photos may be staged, considering the secret nature of Special Ops, real-time photos may not even exsist, let alone be de-classified: they are very illistative of many aspects of operations. There are so many books about SEALS, Special Forces, Rangers, etc. and AF SpecOps is so overlooked, it is about time they get some equal time. This book is the best I have seen, to date.</span>
