                <span id="Label1">First published in 1971, Vietnam Inc. was crucial in changing public attitudes in the United States, turning the tide of opinion and ultimately helping to put an end to the Vietnam War. Philip Jones Griffiths' classic account of the war was the outcome of three years' reporting and is one of the most detailed surveys of any conflict. Showing us the true horrors of the war as well as a study of Vietnamese rural life, the author creates a compelling argument against the de-humanizing power of the modern war machine and American imperialism. Rare and highly sought-after, the book has become one of the enduring classics of photo-journalism. It is now available in this new edition  a careful recreation of the original with Philip Jones Griffiths' personal layouts and commentaries. A new introduction by US linguist and political critic Noam Chomsky discusses the book's impact in changing public opinion.</span>

                    <span>This is by far the best book ever published on the Vietnam War. Out of print for thirty years, it is finally back on the bookshelves, much to the chagrin of the militarists in Washington. It's the only book that completely expains the disaster of what happened in Vietnam. It should be required reading in every school and college in this country.<P>Read the words and learn. Look at the pictures and cry!<P>Our country must never repeat this.</span>

                    <span>From the summer of 1966 through the fall of 1968, I was fighting in some of the same areas of Vietnam that Phillip Jones Griffiths so dramatically photographed. The pictures in his book are a jolting reminder of that experience. <BR>No other book, by a single photographer, comes as close to capturing what Vietnam was like as this does. <BR>He has produced a powerful, informative and compassionate work of photojournalism, that is as immediate today as when it was orignally published.</span>

                    <span>This old book is full of myth and propaganda that you have to wonder why the publisher actually charge money for the book, I usually get these type of books for free when I was still living in Vietnam.<P> The book portrait the Americans as killers, it portrait all the S. Vietnamese as corrupt and whores - typical leftist stereotypes. What the book does not tell you is that the North Vietnamese were the biggest whores and most corrupt government in the world. On January 28,2002 L'express- the French leftist newspaper publish an article by Sylvaine Pasquier(go to lexpress.fr to see the full article), showing that in 1958 the North Vietnamese Communist gave the Spratley and Pearl islands off the coast of South Vietnam and near the Phillipines to China in exchange for Chinese support for the war. Also, in 1999 and 2000, the Vietnamese Communist sign a series of treaties giving China over 13,000 square Kilometers of land in North Vietnam and islands off South Vietnamin exchange for China support against a growing democracy movement in Vietnam. Yes, money to foreign government in exchange for help against the Vietnamese people. Never in the 5000 years history of Vietnam did this happen. Vietnam is a small country to give away thousands of square miles to another country so that they will have you retain absolute power is unforgivable. If Bush gave away 4000 square miles of land to Canada in exchange for campaign contribution, what would Americans think?</span>

                    <span>This is a superb collection of photos that depicts the ironies and inanities that resonated throughout the US misguided war in Vietnam. There are haunting images of casual and mindless brutality, there are wonderful juxtapositions and there are the unforgettable faces of those caught up in the war as they try to lead their lives amidst wanton destruction. This is a book about betrayal...the betrayal of American ideals by US leaders, betrayal of soldiers by arrogant leaders, betrayal of allies for geopolitical machinations and betrayal of a people who suffered more than can be imagined. These timeless photos help us remember a dark chapter in US history and the reissue of this collection in a beautifully produced volume is welcome. Having taught about the Vietnam war to students who were born well after the debacle, this is an extremely valuable resource to bring to life the lessons learned from books and lectures. These mesmerizing images are informed by Griffith's conviction that, " the overwhelming impression of Americans in Vietnam is one of stupidity rather than evil." Certainly some veterans may dislike the photos and text, but few books convey the banality of war so effectively. Griffiths elegantly combines his photos, text and perceptive insights on Vietamese society and in so doing sets a standard for war reportage that others still only aspire to. This book is a must for anyone interested in the Vietnam conflict and the consequences of war.</span>

                    <span>I spent three years in Vietnam as a GI from 1967-70. I saw plenty of combat and was on many operations throughout that time from places like Danang to Saigon to Plieku. I was also assigned for a time to the rear as an intelligence specialist. Reading this book and looking at the shockingly beautiful photographs bring home the realities of that war again. This is a great reference for those who are interested in the Vietnam war and the realities of often mis-directed American foreign policy. We entered that far away war sending ignorant young soldiers to a country with an alien culture and ended up fearing everything we did not understand, often destroying it We did strike out with deadly force against the perceived enemy often killing innocent Vietnamese just trying to get by in an untenable situation. We counted the innocent among the enemy dead. This book has unique insights backed up with stupendous black and white photographs.</span>
