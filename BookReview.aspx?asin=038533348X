                    <span>This book is one of those rare gems that you stumble across by accident and end up loving for your entire life! I was 14 when I first read this and now its practically an annual event.
<br />
<br />I love the standard Vonngeut canon (which is, in order of "must read"ness: Slaughter House 5, Breakfast of Champions and Bluebeard), but none of those titles had quite the effect on me that Cats Cradle did. I won't spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that this apocolyptic satire of religion and science; predestination and free will; ice and ice 9; is brilliant throughout. There's a reason that this book holds cult status with Vonnegut fans around the world; read it, you'll get it!
<br /> 
<br />Reading the rest of the Vonnegut catalogue now just crushes me, because nothing lives up to his big three titles. It was as though he spent himself on his masterpiece and then there was nothing left. Nothing except this one diamond in the rough.
<br />
<br />All I want to know is: who are the reviewers giving this book less than 5 stars?? I just hope that you didn't put your real addresses on your wishlists.... </span>

<br />In Vonnegut's novel, a Manhattan novelist has decided to write a novel about what people were doing on the day that the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, which brings him into encounters with some quintissentially Vonnegutian characters- a bicycle store owner and his Hoosier wife, the children of the man who had the chief say in designing the atomic bomb (one of whom is a midget,) a refugee lounge-singer who has created his own religion (named "Bokonon,") the maniacal dictator who opposes him, and a whole host of colorful minor characters, each of whom fits into the same "karass" (the Bokonon term for a group of people that influence the outcomes of each other's fates.) Many of the twists of the story center around another creation, Ice-Nine, of the famed inventor of the atomic bomb (Felix Hoenekker,) which ultimately causes the destruction of the world (a.k.a. "The day the world went 'whoomp.'") giving itself a nice little niche in the genre of "Theater of the Absurd." 
<br />
<br />Vonnegut's novel satirizes everything about modern life, from the Cold War-era fear of the world ending with a doomsday weapon, to our scorn of avant-garde art, epitomized by the destruction and desecration of the narrator's Manhattan apartment by an up and coming artist. With the central theme that everything in life is interconnected- everyone is part of their "karass"- Vonnegut analyzes the relations between religion and government, sanity and insanity, life and death, and just about any two subjects that oppose each other. This book's wonderfully rich prose, biting criticism, and incisive black humor make this what is considered Vonnegut's best work. Cat's Cradle rules! Another book I want to recommend is The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez -- not Vonnegut but very entertaining and FUNNY nonetheless.

                    <span>In Cat's Cradle, John goes around trying to get facts for his book on the Hiroshima bomb. Vonnegut incorporates completely different things together and never stops striking your interest at the perfect time. The plot doesn't quite make sense, though it's fun to read. I recommend this book to teenagers and younger ages.</span>

                    <span>When I picked up Cat's Cradle, it had been a while since I had last read a Vonnegut (Slaughterhouse Five) so it was as if I was a new reader.  Cat's Cradle is like no other book I have read.  Very wry, very well crafted.  I was totally absorbed in Jonah and his journey and, of course, the fate of ice nine.  An excellent reflection on our society, while still an entertaining read.  Go on and read it already.</span>
