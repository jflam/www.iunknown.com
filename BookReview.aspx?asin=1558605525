                <span id="Label1">Data mining techniques are used to power intelligent software, both on and off the Internet. <I>Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools</I> explains the magic behind information extraction in a book that succeeds at bringing the latest in computer science research to any IS manager or developer. In addition, this book provides an opportunity for the authors to showcase their powerful reusable Java class library for building custom data mining software.<p> This text is remarkable with its comprehensive review of recent research on machine learning, all told in a very approachable style. (While there is plenty of math in some sections, the authors' explanations are always clear.) The book tours the nature of machine learning and how it can be used to find predictive patterns in data comprehensible to managers and developers alike. And they  use sample data (for such topics as weather, contact lens prescriptions, and flowers) to illustrate key concepts. <p> After setting out to explain the types of machine learning models (like decision trees and classification rules), the book surveys algorithms used to implement them, plus strategies for improving performance and the reliability of results. Later the book turns to the authors' downloadable Weka (rhymes with "Mecca") Java class library, which lets you experiment with data mining hands-on and gets you started with this technology in custom applications. Final sections look at the bright prospects for data mining and machine learning on the Internet (for example, in Web search engines). <p> Precise but never pedantic, this admirably clear title delivers a real-world perspective on advantages of data mining and machine learning. Besides a programming how-to, it can be read profitably by any manager or developer who wants to see what leading-edge machine learning techniques can do for their software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Data mining and machine learning basics, sample datasets and applications for data mining, machine learning vs. statistics, the ethics of data mining, generalization, concepts, attributes, missing values, decision tables and trees, classification rules, association rules, exceptions, numeric prediction, clustering, algorithms and implementations in Java, inferring rules, statistical modeling, covering algorithms, linear models, support vector machines, instance-based learning, credibility, cross-validation, probability, costs (lift charts and ROC curves), selecting attributes, data cleansing, combining multiple models (bagging, boosting, and stacking), Weka (reusable Java classes for machine learning), customizing Weka, visualizing machine learning, working with massive datasets, text mining, and e-mail and the Internet.</span>

                    <span>Witten and Frank have generated a book that is readable without eliminating all technical (yes, even mathematical!) descriptions of the key data mining algorithms. And they are up-to-date, including support vector machines and boosting. There are sufficient examples of the techniques to provide readers with a good feel for what each technique can accomplish. For example, how many books can provide a readable explanation of support vector machines?<P>There are some quibbles, such as not including any discussion of neural networks (noted in Ch. 1 with another reference)--I believe it deserves some attention because of its widespread use. Additionally, future editions should include a least a brief summary of data preprocessing, input selection, feature creation, etc. But these are quibbles. <P>The Java portion of the book is not of as much interest to me, but for those wishing to implement the algorithms, it provides a nice blueprint (from the code I looked at).<P>For what they have undertaken, they have performed admirably, and I would highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>This book is THE best book I have read about data mining. And I have read most of them (see ISBNs: 0070057796, 0471253847, 0262560976, 0201403803, 0471179809, 013743980, 0137564120, 1558605290, 1558604030). It is fresh, clear, well balanced. If your native language is not English, then you should definetly read THIS book first. <P>The feature that is the most important for me is "just enough statistics". That is, you can understand the processes & descriptions even if you have not wasted your life and youth studying statistics; what is needed of it to understand is given shortly and very well. Many other books are too deep or too shallow (like Berry's, which is a good introduction, but nothing more than that).<P>If the rating was scaled 1-6 stars, I'd give this book a 10.</span>

                    <span>I've been working with "big name software" for some years, but when I joined the institution I work now and no tools where available I begun my quest for an open source tool that could help me build statistical models applied to real business problems.<P>As a result of this quest I found the WEKA data mining software on the Internet (you can find it on www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/) and that nice piece of software leaded me to this book.<P>This book is EXCELLENT and I am giving 5 *five* stars to it as it helped me understanding the whole process of datamining: from loading the data to building the model.<P>I've read some reviews and I think some of them are not fair (particularly one that says that this book have "just words with no relation or sense at all").. THIS BOOK IS REALLY WELL WRITTEN but you have to read it slowly: As when you study something. <P>Buy this book (*don't forget to download the software*) and I am totally sure that you will be producing and using models in a week.<P>Can't imagine that some weeks ago <P>Cheers,</span>

                    <span>Poor writing, often delves on irritating jokes and unimportant topics (for instance I didn't buy this book to tell me about how cool javadoc is), fails to deliver complete mathematical background for the models, fails to give a good explanation on how to use Weka software. <BR>Overall it's a big black hole that'll eat away a chunk of your time while providing a super low return in useful knowledge. <P>Can't they write a few separate chapters that provide all the information you need and teach you a few algorithms instead of trying to be an encyclopedia and be so shallow as they are?<P>Academic, hard to follow, often references other books for critical info, poorly organized. Skip it while it's not too late.</span>
