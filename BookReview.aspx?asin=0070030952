                <span id="Label1"><p><i>Getting Started in Powerboating</i> is a friendly beginner's guide that concentrates on what you need to know when you first take the helm. This second edition includes a revised gallery of good powerboats, new material on basic safety, preparations to go offshore, and improved illustrations of tricky maneuvers.</p> <p><i>Getting Started in Powerboating</i> covers all powerboats--big and small; single-engine, twin-engine, outboard, and sterndrive; trailerable and non-trailerable; fast planing hulls and slow but seaworthy displacement hulls; and everything in between. It can help you decide what kind of boat is right for you, and it describes fully the characteristic handling and behavior of each type.</p> <p>Bob Armstrong tells you how to dock any boat under any conditions of wind, current, and crowding, and how to leave a slip with a minimum of fuss. He explains how to handle docklines, how to execute close-quarters maneuvers, how to anchor, run inlets, adjust trim for a better ride, and cope with heavy weather. He offers hints for judging the quality of a boat, tips for quick mastery of a boat you've never handled before, and an expert's views on the types of powerboats available--from runabouts to motoryachts to houseboats, jetboats, and catamarans--and what to expect from each.</span>

                    <span>I bought a boat this summer and was looking for a good general introduction to boating. I was very disappointed with this book. The text was often too techinical or just plain lacking in information.<P>Since reading this book I've taken the U.S. Power Squadron boating course and have read The Complete Idiot's Guide to Boating. Both of these were much more useful than this text.</span>

                    <span>Bob Armstrong does a great job explaining what to expect as you get started with a power boat. Much if the information could be available in other places, but this is a great reference.<P>I highly recommend this book to all new boaters who take the United States Power Squadron Boat Safety class I teach because of the first chapter. It poses and explains all the questions one should ask oneself before purchasing a power boat: size, total cost of ownership, type and style, mooring or trailer considerations, etc etc. Understanding and heeding the sound and solid advice in these pages could easily save a boat owner many Boat Units in avoiding wrong choices (A Boat Unit is $1000). It may help you understand what the "Perfect Boat" might be for you, based on your criteria. A definite "Must Have" on your bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>"Getting Started" is an interesting and easy to read book that will give one the background he or she needs to select the right boat and then teaches him how handle it. The author starts with the basics of boating, like why a boat floats and what makes a quality boat and smoothly builds to more complicated topics like boat handling, docking, proper line usage, and weather emergencies. Surely Bob Armstrong has trained many crews in his lifetime as a professional Captain. His examples, diagram, teaching technique, and language are forward and easy to understand. I have made good use of many of the techniques in this book since I started in powerboating. It has been an invaluable guide and reference. Thanks, Bob!</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book because it answered basic power boating questions in one convenient book. The answers could have been found by pouring over a multitude of boating magazines. Much that is covered here can be found in the "classic" books. This book isn't as dry and is well written. A classic book like "Chapmans piloting, seamanship and smallboat handling" (an important resource) is awfully daunting to a beginner anxious to get out on the water. Every beginner should read Bob's chapter on, "Why boats don't behave like cars." <P>I especially liked the early on comparison of the 3 hull types and of the power types - these are some of the first questions a new boater must tackle to make an intelligent choice when shopping for a boat. This book also covers the basics of docking and use of docklines. This isn't the only book you'll buy but it is a good start by a competent, organized writer/seaman.
