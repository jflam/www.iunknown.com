                <span id="Label1">This eye-opening, fact-filled book profiles the rise of the Net Generation, which is using digital technology to change the way individuals and society interact. Essential reading for parents, teachers, policy makers, marketers, business leaders, social activists, and others, Growing Up Digital makes a compelling distinction between the baby boomers&#213; passive medium of television and the explosion of interactive digital media, sparked by the computer and the Internet. Tapscott shows how children, empowered by new technology, are taking the reigns from their boomer parents and making inroads into all areas of society, including our education system, the government, and economy. The result is a timely, revealing look at our digital future that kids and their parents will find both fascinating and instructive.</span>

                    <span>There were many annoying things about this book.  Perhaps most annoying is that he never really talks about economies, and just blathers about gee-whiz technology in a rapid fire manner.  He doesn't really penetrate much into the technology, nor bothers to say how it is really going to affect economies.  The book is full of pre-9/11, pre-internet bubble euphoria, and never spends any time fully exploring its interesting premise. <p>Certain the internet and communication technologies will effect the economy, and anyone trying to get any real insight here, beyond that it will make the world a better place and lots of people are going to make more money (stated over and over again), will be greatly let down.<p>The effects of technology on economies is better described elsewhere, such as "The Innovator's Dilemma" and other books that understand both economics and the relevant technology, something a "visionary" such as Tapscott has no time for.<p>Beyond providing insight into internet/technology mania of the mid to late 90's, I see no reason to invest time to read this book.</span>

                    <span>Tapscott helped create the genre of new economy books with this effort. If he did not coin the term new economy he certainly helped to popularize it. Tapscott is an internationally sought after consultant, writer, and speaker on the subject of information technology. Technology related issues of the new economy are prominently featured in this book. Tapscott's clarity and broad domain expertise make The Digital Economy an extremely informative read. <p>He was one of the first authors to introduce the idea that communications, computing, and content were all converging into new media. His business transformation through new media model wherein the effective individual leads to, the high performance team which leads to, the integrated enterprise which leads to, the extended enterprise which leads to, the inter-networked business which leads to ..., clearly anticipated the current eBusiness model rage, where the integration/collapsing of the supply chain is the road to competitive advantage.<p>Even though (at the moment) New Economy thinking has fallen out of favor, Don will be proven correct on many fronts and this book will stand out as one of the most relevant portraits of this (still) emerging landscape.</span>

                    <span>Even if the book was written in the mid 90 it still gives the bases to understand how Digital Economy is transforming our businesses and lives. Don Tapscott is clearly explaining that after Total Quality Management TQM, Business Processes Reengineering BPR we enter a new era where we will be asked to literally transform our businesses and lives.<p>The convergence of computing, telecommunications and content is a real revolution, giving access to a networked economy working in real time and without knowing distances. This means that boundaries are exploding. Learning is becoming a continuous process and part of our day to day work it is why Digital Economy is often called Knowledge Economy. Customer is integrated in the production process and organizations are moving from a vertical integration to extended networks including customers, suppliers and more and more often competitors. We are far from the industrial hierarchical organizations where we are working now.<p>Don Tapscott is helping us to understand the New Economy 12 themes supported by the 10 technological shifts and the move from individual effectiveness to the internetworked businesses through high performance teams, integrated organizations and extended enterprises. But finally he is convincing us that as part of an internetworked leadership, we are collectively responsible to achieve the transformation of our businesses for a better life promised by the New interactive Economy.<p>Don Tapscott is also helping us to evaluate impact of the Digital Economy on our business work, on our education systems, and on our governments. The interactivity is transforming the media industry and asking a new leadership for our businesses.<br>Don Tapscott doesn't forget to discuss the peril of the Digital Economy from privacy protection to electronic democracy.<p>Digital Economy is a real knowledge spring where you come back regularly to improve your understanding of the surrounding growing New Economy.</span>

                    <span>Don Tapscott provides an overview of the way the digitalization of information is transforming the economy and projects the likely changes ahead from his perspective in 1996. The book suggests ways to exercise leadership effectively in this transformed, networked world. However, since this thoughtful, well-organized book was written several years ago, it is mainly of historical interest now, because of the rapid changes in the digital world. Still, it is useful to apply some of the themes Tapscott developed when you consider how the digital economy is continuing to evolve. ...recommend this well-written book for a general audience as well as executives and managers who are interested in the unfolding of the new economy.</span>
