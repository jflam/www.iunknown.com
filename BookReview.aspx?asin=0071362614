                    <span>Silberman has brought together 45 different tools to help the consultant carry out a variety of projects. The book is probably due for a new edition, but many of the tools are as relevant now as they were when the book was published.
<br />
<br />Because the book's scope is broad, it's best used as a way to frame your thinking on how to solve a problem, or to suggest a summary approach to a client issue. It's a good reference to be sure you're not leaving things out that you should think about, rather than a comprehensive guide to engagement problem-solving.
<br />
<br />This is an ambitious book with lots of great ideas.

                    <span>Unlike "A reader", I think this book is valuable. It is indeed a hodge podge collection of contributions from many authors and their styles are certainly different. But that is OK. This is not a novel, it is a toolkit, and an excellent one. Take what you need when you need it and leave the rest alone.

                    <span>This is a great book.  It has contributions from 45 different authors.  The contributions are too many to list but include such areas as 360 surveys, coaching, managing change, teambuilding and many more.  You are also able to download many of these which allows for easy duplication.  For the price it is a tremendous value.  I am glad that I purchased it.</span>

                    <span>The Consultant's Toolkit contains survey tools, assessments, training activities, and step-by-step procedures for organizational development projects that are practical, easy to follow, and easy to customize.  Even though the book is designed for organizational development consultants, in-house training and development personnel will benefit from this book just as much as independent consultants.  There are even surveys, forms, and other tools in this book that can be downloaded so users can edit and print the tools to fit their own specific company or client needs.  Anyone who is responsible for building management coaching skills, leading change, implementing 360 degree or employee surveys, building teams, and enhancing an organization's culture will find ideas they can use immediately.</span>
