                    <span>i'm NOT a religious person, and i think that's why i LOVE this book because he's a living example of how you can be SPIRITUAL but not RELIGIOUS. you can believe in God and not be religious. a lot of people don't understand this. however, this was the first autobiography i read (i read it like 3 years ago), and i was very, very impressed. this book is very powerful, life changing, spiritual, helpful, educational and entertaining. now i always thought Mase was cool as a rapper (i was never a FANATIC like a lot of my other peers) but i must say i like him better as a pastor. when he came back to rap i was very dissapointed because he conradicts EVERYTHING about rap in this book. he said he was young and bitter when he wrote this book, well i say write another book because if you read this book NOW (after he came back to rap) you wouldn't like Mase at all anymore, because you'd be confused, misled and angry. so i do reccommend this book for it's power (and it's secrets on Camron, Foxy Brown, Puffy, 112 and an unkown stripper who Mase discovered.....EVE!!) but i DON'T reccommend it because it's conradicting everything he stands for today. </span>

                    <span>I give it 5 stars 'cause it's was the best that he put out. The reason why he retired from hip-hop 'cause he had to get his mind focused. So he asked God to be his guidance. I was basically felt everything where he go to in life incl. starting out as a rappper and then a minister. Y'know Mase would be talkin' 'bout a lot of things that goin' on in our world right now. (i.e. Hip-Hop has lost its culture, too many people dying and getting killed, what's the difference between secular rap vs. sacred rap, I mean Good rap vs. Bad rap. Simple. I proud of Mase for what he did and I hope for that he put out another album that'll be entitled "Karma" (which he'll be workin' on w/ help from the Neptunes producing that album.) I read it supposed to drop out next year. So hopefully it will be good and make sure it's not the last. Well anyway, long story, Lemme put this down. Here some messages on which I quote down the book which I put down as my favorites.
<br />
<br />Here are they:
<br />
<br />"The best rap music is the most arrogant, with the most demonic message. How can you mix that with God?" pg. 76
<br />
<br />"People say they want to reach young people so they have to use music that young people want to listen to. What happens when young people want to listen to pimps? Do we make gospel pimps? You're trying to change God to fit what the people want. What got you saved? The Bible says God doesn't change." pg. 76
<br />
<br />"It's sad to say it but Biggie died for rap, but rap sure didn't die for Biggie. Christ is the only thing you should be dying for, because He's the only one who was willing to die for you. Dying for rap? That ain't the move. That just shows you to be real careful what you put your faith in and what you say you're willing to die for-- becuase of what you speak into creation happens. There is so much power into the tongue." pg. 62
<br />
<br />If you like to learn more about this, read over some scriptures on which I read off the Bible (i.e. Phillipians 4:8, Romans 12:1-2, 2 Cor 5:17-21, 2 Tim 2:22, 1 Tim 5:22, Acts 2:38,40, etc.)just to help you understand
<br />I'm not saying you can't listen to rap or whatever, but keep that in mind you have to be alert on what you say and how you bring a message to people. That's how I did it.
<br />
<br />But you can still listen to hip-hop as long you don't condemn it or whateva, 'cause what happen is that people would get into the wrong message of saying things that would offend people y'know what I mean? Hip-Hop has to be about culture, life, 'bout love, honor, respect, and spirituality. All types of things.
<br />
<br />But as long as you keep loving God and thanking Him for your spirit, love and everything, you know he'll follow Him. Yeah always believe that. 'cuz to me I love God and I thank Him each day for giving me the power to help people.
<br />
<br />and Pastor Mase, I luv you and hope you continue to do your thing man 'cuz i'm a big supporter. I don't care what people say about you. But you keep doin' your thing, aight?
<br />
<br />Anyway, I highly recommend this book to those who want to read more about Mase and want to follow his footsteps that he is. 'cuz His album "Welcome Back" which he put out in Aug of this year is off da chain man. Ya'll gotta go cop his album and especially his entire book. I believe that he is taking hip-hop to another level like Kanye West (who is my favorite rapper to date) trying to change what hip-hop should be in the near future. 
<br />
<br />Peace I'm out and may God bless.

                    <span>First of all i want to start off saying that i'm a big Mase fan. I've been with him since the first day i heard his smoove rapping style and i am still with him until today. I personally have NOT read the book YET, but after reading the reviews and being down with mase for so long, you can be sure i am getting it ASAP, please belive that!! I myself am a lost christian, i have been caught up in this rap system and i'm trying to find a way out. And i truly believe that this book will help me find my way..back to God. Only he knows how much i need him in my life. I've been trying to get back on the right path, but I was afraid to lose my &#34;coolness&#34; and afraid of what my friends might think of me. But all that doesn't matter anymore. I will get there step by step and i'm only asking God to bare with me. 
<br />
<br />&#60; Back to Mase &#62;.... Many people out there would think that one must be crazy to give up their fortune, fame and luxurious life to follow something that doesn't directly give them the materialistic things. But i believe in Mase and I strongly belive that he was created for this! I remember on reading an interview where you were asked &#34; If you could give somethings away, what would it be?&#34;  his reponse was &#34; Everything...because i have God in my life and through him i can get it all back&#34;
<br />
<br />Bottom line is i'm really excited to this book and find more about this dude we call Mase aka Mason Betha and the messages he has for not only for the hip-hop community but for the whole world.
<br />
<br />-- GO BUY HIS &#34;WELCOME BACK&#34; If you don't have it yet, I belive it's a continuation of the book, with beautiful songs. GO GET!!</span>

                    <span>This book is an amazing read.  Mason says he'll mever return to rap, but he has.  I'm not insulting this decision at all.  I think his religious life will now help him spread the good word through music.  Now to the book.<p>The book was inspirational to the very end.  I am a fan of Mase's music and that's why I bought this book.  His story is so amazing.  He came from nothing and became a major selling rapper, only to drop it all for God.  I personally love the ways God showed him that he wasn't supposed to be a rapper at that time.  <p>The main point is this book is amazing and I suggest everyone needs to get this and get his return album, "Welcome Back", when it hits stores Aug. 24.</span>
