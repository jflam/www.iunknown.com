                    <span>I spend all winter planning my hikes for the summer. I own and have used most of the titles for Yosemite. Hiking Yosemite National Park has most of the most popular trails but two other books do a better job:  100 Hikes in Yosemite National Park and Lonely Planet Hiking in the Sierra Nevada.<p>My main complaint is the incomplete descriptions, too short and too vague.  If you get off the trail you'll run the risk of getting lost because there are no "big picture" maps.  A topo is absolutely essential if you want to understand your location.</span>

                    <span>This is an indispensible guidebook for any hiker who loves Yosemite. I use it almost daily during hiking season and it helps in selecting hikes, planning them, reaching the trailhead and gauging whether a hike will be worthwhile. Each hike contains an accurate, though brief, description of the rigors of each trek. Occasionally I quibble with the authors ranking of a given hike, but usually they are on the mark.<p>A few cautionary notes: there are no detailed maps in the book, except general maps which introduce the hiker to each specific place. Te map for the John Muir trail, for example, is very basic. Don't expect detailed maps for each hike because there are none. The descriptions of how to reach each trailhead are excellent, unless you have little experience with Yosemite.<p>My favorite part of the book is that the Touloume Meadows High Country area is not neglected. Swedo has various categories and list the hikes they think are best suited to be placed in every league and the valley floor is not the only area of the park that is stressed .If you spend any time hiking in Yosemite, this book is essential!</span>

                    <span>Like most Falcon hiking guides, this one provides useful and reliable information.  The only shortcoming is it doesn't provide comprehensive information on all the trails and destinations.  It wouldn't take much to add this info so that a reader who wanted to cobble together a different hike from the ones described in detail could figure out distances and altitudes gained (similar, for example, to AMC guides for hiking in various locales out East).</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book for a trip to Yosemite that I took earlier this year.  The descriptions of the hikes were wonderful and included such key details as where to park and what the water & facility opportunities are on the trails.  Another key detail in the book was a breakdown of elevation gain per foot.  I used it to help plan my Half Dome hike and it was essential.  Unfortunately there was an incident in my pack with the bug spray so I'm online today to purchase this book again to help plan my new conquest - El Capitan.</span>

                    <span>Great book.  Has maps and descriptions for a ton of hikes in Yosemite.  Contains a chart of hikes by difficulty, scenery, etc.  I'll definitely go with FalconGuide for future hiking books.</span>
