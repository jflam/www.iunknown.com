                    <span>I cannot fathom a guess as to how many times the books in this series have saved my in project work over the years.  The only drawback with this series is that some publisher should endeavor to keep them up to date.  Serious Unix system programmers must have copies of the complete series.</span>

                    <span>This is an essential book for any serious or professional Unix programmer. <p>Written in a clear paedagogical style, Professor Stevens demonstrates mastery of the subject, and his desire to pass that expertise on to the reader. <p>The API's are illuminated by clear examples of their use. He also mentions many of the pitfalls to look out for when programming across the different flavours (BSD, SRV4) and different standards (POSIX, ANSI). <p>It is a comprehensive tome that represents real value for money. <p>I use this book so much I will probably need to buy another copy in a few years, if it doesn't go on permanent loan first.</span>

                    <span>How could anyone objectively rate this incredible text at one star!? Have you read any of it or do you just pick books to "dis"? This book, like all of Steven's books, is fantastic. And I'm not a Unix guru or a C guru.</span>
