                <span id="Label1">Depending on your handicap, the name Tom Fazio either strikes fear in  your heart or sets your blood rising to the challenge. One of the most  celebrated course designers of the past three decades, Fazio has left his  imprint on such showcase tracks as Kiawah Island Club, Grayhawk, Butler  National, Barton Creek, Hartefeld National, and the TPC at Myrtle Beach. His  beautifully illustrated <I>Golf Course Designs</I> opens a window onto the  thinking that went into those and other courses--and understanding a designer's  intentions is as powerful a weapon as any club in the bag.<p>  Using his own designs as his laboratory, Fazio, through text and pictures,  unveils the mystery of his methods and the ways in which technology has affected  changes in golf course architecture through the 20th century. As difficult as  Fazio's courses can play, he emphasizes that his intention isn't to punish  golfers--though he has no problem with punishing bad shots--but to inspire  golfers by providing a fair test of skill, whatever a player's skill level, in  the most dramatic setting possible. To that end, he explains how he routes a  course, where and why he sets bunkers and hazards, how he frames a hole for  aesthetic appeal, how he sets greens and tees, when he leaves the landscape as  he finds it, and why he brings in bulldozers to move what nature didn't provide  to his liking.<p>  "The classic tension in golf course design as I see it," he writes, "is not  between risk and reward, but between playability and difficulty.... Even if a  client wanted to build the toughest course around, I would argue that it should  be fair." A golfer who can learn to use each hole's inherent fairness to  advantage is a golfer who can post better scores. And, in the end, that's the  most important secret Fazio's attractive volume reveals. <I>--Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>Tom Fazio is one of the best golf course designers of all time. Because I am from the Philadelphia area, I am not privileged to play as many of his courses as I would like. When you first pick up this book, you might falsely believe it is nothing more than a picture book. Don't be fooled though. Fazio provides some interesting insight into why he chose to sculpt his courses the way he did. Many golf enthusiasts might recognize Fazio's name from courses they've played, but he has also done some masterful redesigns as well including the recent improvements to Augusta National. <BR>Yes, the pictures add another dimension to the book, but the fact that it is an easy read and one that provides great insight is what brings this book to another level.<BR>I highly recommended this book not only for golfers but for those who enjoy the aesthetics of a golf course as well.</span>

                    <span>If you play golf, you must have this book. I am lucky enough to work at a Fazio course (Victoria National - Indiana) and so naturally this book was special to me.<P>It is enjoyable to look at as well as interesting to read.<P>Anyone who plays or wishes they could play will HAVE to have this book.</span>

                    <span>Unlike most books destined for the coffee table, Fazio transends the swing arc to a beautiful look at the vision of the the ulimate playing field- the golf course. With a wonderful perspective of design, the challange of the game starts with the challange of the course. The pictures are beautiful beyond description but the story, passion and the theory are even more great. Tom Fazio has taken his agressiveness from the tour and put it to the turf. This is a wonderful book for the golf enthusiast!</span>
