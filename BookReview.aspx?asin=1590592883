                <span id="Label1"><blockquote><p>"I recommend this book to architects as much as to developers. It challenges you to begin thinking about how to better build your applications while teaching you how to tie together Design Patterns, Object Orientation, and .NET."</p> <p class="bbt1">&mdash; Maxim V. Karpov, Faith Interactive</p></blockquote>  <p>Application frameworks, which provide a base of common services on which applications are built, offer the benefits of extensibility, modularity, and reusability of both code and design to your applications. This book explains what frameworks are and how they fit into applications, and offers many object-oriented techniques used in application frameworks. </p>  <p>This book also shows you actually how to develop application frameworks through a concrete framework example called Simplified Application Framework (SAF). The SAF framework was developed by Xin Chen in C#. It consists of common services needed by many applications, such as a class factory service, configuration service, event notification service, security service, and transaction service. This book goes into detail on each of these services to explain its benefits, as well as its design and implementation in C#. Through a discussion of each service, you will also learn about many advanced .NET techniques employed by the framework, such as .NET remoting, reflection, custom attributes, multithreading, and serviced components. </p>  <p>Many of the services discussed in the book also use design patterns as their blueprints. This book discusses these design patterns in-depth and shows how to implement them in a real-world scenario. Accompanying the book are the complete source code of the sample framework and sample executable projects (downloadable via the Internet), allowing readers to actually test out each framework service/component of SAF and learn about the development of frameworks, .NET technologies, and design patterns in a more interactive fashion.</p> <p> <b>Special Note</b> This book covers .NET 1.0 and 1.1. and assumes knowledge of the .NET Framework and C#.</p></span>

                    <span>This book really sheds light on many of the Classic Gang of Four Design Patterns and provides real world, meaningful examples to demonstrate them.
<br />
<br />If you have ever wanted to know how to use proper object oriented techniques in .NET, this book is for you.
<br />
<br />The book provides some very interesting approaches on extensible, practicle, and reusable code, and the samples are right on par with the typical functionality that an application framework should provide.
<br />
<br />It is also a very clean and easy to read book, and is organized very well.</span>

                    <span>You know, I was going through this book for several chapters before it struck me. Xin Chen has provided us with something analogous to Eclipse. But whereas Eclipse is coded in Java, and is meant for Java developers, he has given us a corresponding framework in .NET! Perhaps unwittingly, for the book's index has no entry for Eclipse. I bring this up because more of you should be familiar with Eclipse, even if you are a .NET programmer and have never actually used Eclipse. Whereas Chen's Simplified Application Framework is likely to be totally new to you.<p>But you should be aware that Eclipse has garnered very favourable mindshare and usage in the Java community. In Java, it provides a real life validation of the entire framework approach. Which is encouraging here. For surely .NET needs a similar framework atop it. So the conceptual basis for this book is secure.<p>So how is the SAF? From the book's description, it seems not to have as rich a feature set as Eclipse. But IBM spent several $million in its development, before throwing it to open source. Whereupon, many other programmers also built it up. For SAF, it is still early days. SAF seems to be mostly (entirely?) Chen's own effort. Very commendable for one person.</span>

                    <span>Finally a book that not only explains the theory and design decisions behind putting together a framework, but also supplies a fully functioning framework for you to start with.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!<p>On a side note... the editor should be flogged because of the numerous grammatical errors.</span>
