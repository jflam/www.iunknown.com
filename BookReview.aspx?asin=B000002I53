                <span id="Label1">This 1960 recording was a landmark album in John Coltrane's career, the first to introduce his quartet with pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones and the first release on which he played soprano saxophone. It also provided him with a signature hit, as his new group conception came together wonderfully on the title track. It's an extended modal reworking in 6/4 time that brought the hypnotic pulsating quality of Indian music into jazz for the first time, with Coltrane's soprano wailing over the oscillating piano chords and pulsing drums. The unusual up-tempo version of Gershwin's "Summertime" is a heated example of Coltrane's "sheets of sound" approach to conventional changes, while "But Not for Me" receives a radical harmonic makeover. This is an excellent introduction to Coltrane's work. <i>--Stuart Broomer</I></span>

                    <span>Coltrane was God. Only he could take a show tune and fill it with sonic hurricanes and the kind musical dexterity on display here. Drummer Elvin Jones is a revelation and would be one of the most influential in jazz or rock.
<br />
<br />This album also introduced the world to one of Jazz musics' greatest quartets. And one of the 3 greatest 60s jazz bands(the other 2 - Miles great mid 60s quintet with Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams..., and Ornette Coleman's early 60s quartet with Don Cherry)
<br />
<br />This is essential to any jazz collection.</span>

                    <span>Compared to the other Coltrane recordings I have, this one seems to fall short of the mark.  While the title cut is adventurous, has some impassioned sax playing, and has a beautiful rhythmic flow, it seems that McCoy Tyner (who, incidentally, is one of my favorites) spends his entire solo section trying to figure out what to play, killing time by plinking some octaves, or vamping while waiting for Coltrane to come back in, which doesn't happen for too long a time. Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye is a beautiful first-rate rendition of a standard ballad, and Summertime and But Not For Me are very enjoyable uptempo pieces.  Try as I might, I still feel like I'm waiting for something to happen when listening to the title cut.  Maybe I'll get it a few months down the road. </span>

                    <span>Some of the jazz snobs on this page seem somewhat underwhelmed by this classic, enduring recording.  I come down firmly on the side of those who absolutely love it.  Perhaps it's not quite as innovative or complex as Coltrane's free-form output, but it is lovely to hear.  I find that the melody of a well-known tune imposes a discipline on the musician and one of the pleasures of this recording is hearing how Trane and company expand these very familiar tunes, how they stray away from them and come back again</span>

                    <span>Martin Williams came up with the best metaphor for Coltrane: a rat in a maze. Which obviously refers to Trane's indefatigable up-and-downing. I'm profoundly bored by Trane's determination to squeeze every possible note into every phrase. He tried to say everything and ended up saying nothing. He's a testament to the cliche: "What you omit is just as important as what you include." Let me also confess that I hate the timbre of the soprano sax.</span>

                    <span>this album only deserves one rating 5 stars. What was supposed to be a laid back session of standards has become a timeless classic. Every song on this album is a highpoint. I like bluetrane the best but this one comes in close second along w/ giant steps. Giant Steps may showcase trane's talent more but my fav things shows his timeless class.</span>
