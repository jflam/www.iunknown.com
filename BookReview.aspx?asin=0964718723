                    <span>The format is good and there is plenty of space. The bad news is that there are not enough pages for an entire years' worth of entries -- that is really bad. So an otherwise good journal has a serious flaw. Moreover, the race prediction tables are both incomplete and inaccurate (including spelling errors -- maratime rather than marathon.) The book is more expensive than similar products.</span>

                    <span>Lot a good things about Jeff's training program. I've found it<BR>very helpfull over the last year so decided to pick up this journal. Big mistake. While it's got it's good points; I especially like the training programs, time predictors, <BR>sensible layout for daily entries, and lots of room in the back for notes, it has one fatal flaw. Contrary to the claim on the back cover that there are "daily entries for one year", you will find by the end of October you're using those empty note pages because you've run out of pre-printed log pages. <P>No journal, no matter how good, that doesn't have space for a full year doesn't pass my minimums. The fact that the cover lies<BR>I find inexcusable. Get the Runner's World Training Diary, it's got most everything this book has plus a full year's worth of entry space, and it's [...] less [money].</span>

                    <span>I followed the Galloway training program for my first marathon. I started using the training journal as I began training for my second marathon. I am able to record my progress and make sure I stay on track. The motivational quotes each week push me along and I often copy them into emails that I send to my fellow training partners. The book is organized so that you can begin any week and write in the dates. Also helpful are the pacing charts at the end of the book. I like to be able to look back at previous weeks and map my progress. I always write how I felt during the runs or other workouts and who I ran or trained with. It helps me to recognize patterns in my workouts. I plan to purchase another training journal after the Disney marathon to continue monitoring my success with running.</span>
