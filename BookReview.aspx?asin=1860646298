                <span id="Label1"><div>This book looks at one of the most important and engrossing chapters in 20th century Iranian history. The post-World War I period began with a triumvirate of Iranian political grandees, encouraged by the British government, attempting to shoe-horn Iran into the British Empire. This was followed by a bizarre coup d'&eacute;tat, engineered by a British general, which brought to power the Reza Shah Pahlavi who ended 130 years of Qajar rule.<br></div></span>

                    <span>IRAN AND THE RISE OF REZA SHAH, a most informative and meticulously researched enterprise undertaken by Cyrus Ghani, is an accurate history of the period, without embellishment, that amirably fills the general void in impartiality on this subject in recent years. The stellar dramatis personae in this admirable book, admired or reviled by contempoarary Iranians, have been very objectively treated by the author, who follows in the steps of his late father, Dr. Ghassem Ghani, a distinguished diplomat and writer himself. The historian, researchher or writer will have much to learn and gain by this book. It should be a must in libraries and centers of education. Yousof A. Mazandi</span>

                    <span>Iran and the Rise of Reza Shah is an intellectual tour de force. It is well written, original, incisive and compelling. Above all, though, its most impressive aspect is the original research that went into its crafting. It is a case study in the gathering, sifting, collating etc. of arcane documents. More importantly, Iran and the Rise of Reza Shah is also a paradigm of the judicious use of the same to add to the narrative drive rather than showcase the author's expertise. The result, therefore, is a book that is not only scholarly, but captivating--a combination that is not easily achieved; and especially not when the subject matter addresses such murky, intricate and convoluted topics as the role of the British in Iran and the malfeasance of the Iranian political elite. Nevertheless, Cyrus Ghani dissects these complex, interwoven malignancies in such an eminently logical, credible and documented manner that he elavates Iran and the Rise of Reza Shah to the level of an instant classic: definitive in its field and required reading for anyone interested in understanding Iran and its history.</span>

                    <span>Reza Shah Pahlavi, the man who founded the last monarchic dynasty in Iran's long history, was, by all accounts the greatest public figure of his nation in the 20th century.<BR>His rise from a modest background- he was a semi-literate son of a poor peasant family- to kingship is the stuff of dreams. <BR>His success in reuniting Iran and transforming it from a ramshackle feudal state into a modern one is almost incredible.<BR>Thus his life should have provided the material for a highly readable biography.<BR>Sadly this is not the case with Mr. Ghani's hefty book.<BR>Ghani has managed to make an exciting life sound almost dull. <BR>He has also failed to analyse any of the events he reports, almost exculively based on British archive material.<BR>The story of Reza Shah is still waiting to be written by a real biographer.<BR>J.

                    <span>Some readers of this book appear too harsh on the author.<BR>The book is certainly not the pinnacle of the art of biography. Ghani's prose is hesitant, almost amateurish. The book is also full of factual errors and tedious repetitions.<BR>But the subject, a soldier who rose to become the King of Kings of Iran, one of the oldest monarchies in the world, is fascinating enough to compensate for the author's weaknesses.<BR>Also, Ghani must be commended for sifting through a mass of British official documents about a critical period in Iranian history. He has been unable to analyze the documents and point out their relevance to events. But the fact that he offers them in good order is no mean achievement.<BR>I give Ghani's book two stars if only because he has created new interest in Reza Shah, one of the greatest figures of the 20th century Middle East.<BR>Interested Reader</span>

                    <span>As an outsider interested in Iran- thanks to Iranians friends- I was keen to learn more about a king who is regarded by many Iranians as the only leader worthy of respect the country has had for centuries.<BR>In fact, my Iranian friends insist that only someone like Rez Shah could save their country from its current decline, and restore it to the path of progress and civilization.<BR>The subject, therefore, must be exciting.<BR>This book, however, is the very essence of dullness. It is as if the writer designed it to make the subject uninteresting. <BR>There are large chunks of reports from the British diplomatic archives, little independent narrative, and no analysis whatsoever.<BR>Worse still the author's prose is schoolboyish while the book seems to have not passed through the process of copy-reading and editing. It is full of factual and grammatical errors.<BR>I dropped the book several times but made efforts to return to it. In the end the whole excercise was too much.<BR>Please,please, pleeeeeeze, someone write a readable biography of Reza Shah! WV</span>
