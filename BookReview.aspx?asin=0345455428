It contains so much information (e.g. cast lists, synopsis, trivia, air dates) and will keep any TV fan reading till past midnight! An excellent book - I'm looking forward to the 7th edition.</span>

                    <span>It's like a trip down memory lane!<P>The only other edition of this book I owned was the version published in 1987. So this edition is a quantum leap forward.<BR> <BR>I challenge you to find a more thorough guide to prime time TV. This book has everything - down to the minutest detail. Even if you just scan through this book you'll see in-depth references to shows you've long forgotten about. It really is like flipping through an old family album that has been lost to time or stashed away for years. The memories just come flooding back to you.<P>Special enhanced bonus: the appendixes at the back that break down the shows by longest-running, spin-offs, etc. <P>No kidding: the last time I sat down to read through this book, I let SO MUCH time go by that by the time I put it down I had to shave again. <P>Absolutely worth picking up, but nearly impossible to put down!!<P>Don't believe me? Read some of the other reviews listed here for this simply fantastic reference book. There's a reason everyone gives this book 5 stars!</span>

                    <span>This book sort of considers itself the "industry standard" at giving you the facts about television shows. And, in many ways, it does give you a sense of many of the programs listed here, more than six thousand, as the cover states. However, it frequently doesn't know whether it wants to give you the gossipy dish on a program or to clearheadedly state the facts of a show, and it frequently misses the historical records or the most important points about and surrounding the listings.<P>For example, in the case of television's most celebrated flop, "My Mother The Car," they flatly state the plot of the program, but nothing about how outrageous the concept was or any of the commentary about it. Meanwhile, just over the page, they talk of how many people found the critical darling, "My So-Called Life" whiny and melodramatic!<P>Either a tome like this should treat all shows with no editorial opinion included, or they should dish the dirt on all programs. It makes the authors seem like rank amateurs to try to be both critics and paladins of television facts.<P>One final note: They always state, with each ensuing version of this book (currently at the Eighth Edition), that the text is "completely revised and updated." This is a lie. The reviews and comments on every show reviewed in a previous edition is exactly the same as it was when it first appeared. Some of these are embarrassingly outdated, like the comments they made about the landmark miniseries, "Roots." <P>This book is helpful to people who are aware of the programs firsthand and won't be swayed by the author's biases. However, with internet resources available, this book and many others like it may soon be as dead as many of the shows it purportedly reviews.</span>

                    <span>The best ever!! Tried to stump the book with obscure TV shows and everyone was listed. Goes by alphabetical order and with calendars of all the years from 1946 to the 2003. You'll never forget who appeared in what. Alot of detail on each show. As soon as I looked thru it, I was sorry I hadn't had this book for years. The best TV reference book you can have.</span>

                    <span>I already have two earlier editions of this TV bible and had to have this new one. It's more than worth the money. I'll read this one cover to cover as soon as I can bestill my beating heart. I've checked out the write-ups for newer shows such as Buffy -- the authors have proven that they're still in top form. This edition even includes a trivia section, which I will attempt after reading the 1500 or so pages of television history. A must-have for anyone who watches TV.</span>
