                    <span>In a world where it's becoming common to meet significant others in a variety of ways including on the internet, "Love is Blind" struck a chord or satisfying resonance with me.  Of personal ads, pen pals and blind dates are nothing new, but in this crazy busy world we live in alternative dating schemes such as those introduced in the three short-stories of this anthology are now more commonplace.
<br />
<br />In Brown's contribution, we see a lawyer who seems to "have it all" realizing that success is not as sweet without someone to share it with.  She takes a chance on finding love in cyberspace, much to the chagrin of one of her dear friends who thinks such antics are only for the desperate.  In Brown's charming story, we see that sometimes taking a chance pays off.
<br />
<br />Simmon's story focuses on a long-standing practice of letter writing in "pen pal" fashion.  As love blossoms through the mail for a radio-show host and her doting fan, we see her struggle with past disappointments as she struggles to trust that the affection shared through words is real.
<br />
<br />In the final story by Watson, we see a case of mistaken identity turn to romance when a man whose purpose it is to relay that his irresponsible friend will not show up for a blind date becomes enamored with lady in waiting. The major tension arises when instead of revealing his true identity he assumes the identity of his missing-in-action friend.  When the truth comes out, will his potential lady love be able to forgive him.
<br />
<br />Although a bit whimsical in places, all in all this is a story that will appeal to the true romantics at heart.  This is a great read for a lazy summer day or a rainy afternoon.  It is also one I'll revisit!</span>

                    <span>This book is a little out there.  Like, these situations would never happen.  Not at all realistic.  Somewhat entertaining, but it took me some time to get thru it.  Boredom set in after a while.</span>

                    <span>Who said you cannot find love over the internet, in the personals or on a blind date?  Urban Books anthology, Love is Blind, showcases three authors who say you can as they write love stories based on blind dates.  <p>In Parry "EbonySatin" Brown's story, Love is Just a Click Away for Mysti Ellington.  Mysti has just made partner in the law firm she works for and is now looking for someone to share her success.  She is determined to try the personals on the internet, much to the dismay of her best friend, RaMona.  RaMona wants Mysti to meet men the old fashioned way and introduces Mysti to Keith.  While attracted to Keith, it is Stephan who has Mysti intrigued.  What happens when Mysti and Stephan finally meet?<p>In Pat Simmons' story, Words of Love, radio talk show host, Carmel French and sales rep, Rice Taylor, express their feelings for each other by writing love letters. It starts with one simple letter to the station from Rice and for months they correspond by mail.  In their letters to each other they fall in love, sight unseen.  Will the love still exist when they finally come face to face?<p>In The Switch by Lisa Watson, Justin Langley attempts to save Sabrina Ridgemont the embarrassment of being stood up by his best friend, Adrian.  Justin means to tell her the truth of who he really is, but an ex-fiance shows up with some unkind things to say and Justin cannot reveal his true identity. When the truth is revealed, how will Sabrina react?<p>Love is Blind is a book for the true romantic.  In each story falling in love with an unknown person is the central theme.  While Love is Just a Click Away was an easy and humorous read, the other two stories were long and drawn out.  The female protagonists in Words of Love and The Switch had so many issues they became frustrating and the reading laborious.  I think the romance reader will like this book.<p>Jeanette<br>APOOO BookClub</span>

                    <span>This book was incredible.  Each author wove a unique and enthralling tale that pulled me in from the first word.  I curled up with Love is Blind and a glass of merlot, and before I knew it, I'd almost finished the entire book. The next day, I couldn't wait to get home from work so I could pick up where I'd left off. Ladies, I think you have a winner here!  Can't wait for the next one!</span>
