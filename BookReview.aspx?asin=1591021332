                    <span>Kern's easy-to-read, educated analysis allows us to relive the stories while seeing how they build confidence and self-understanding through Harry's choices, based on values rather than outside pressure. 50-some years old, left brained and typically interested in non-fiction, I started reading the Harry Potter books because I admired so that they made kids interested in reading.  I believe reading is the key to a child's futures and I wanted to understand the motivation these books were giving young people.  So far, I've loved 5 of the Potter books and the 6th one is on order.  I also gave the Potter fever to my 74-year-old Dad and brother, a tough 34-year-old in prison who read and then passed them around to other inmates!  He said, "Now I see why Mom loved to read."  Then I found and read the Wisdom of Harry Potter by Edmund Kern, drawn by the great art on the cover, subtitle and Table of Contents - not to mention Kern's credentials and Introduction.  The Wisdom of Harry Potter made me feel great for "choosing" to delve into Rowling's stories.  Mr. Kern deserves 10 stars for sharing his brilliance so delightfully!</span>

                    <span>I thouroughly enjoyed this book by Edmund Kern. He does a great job of encapsulating the morality of Harry Potter. Excellent use of resources and summarizing other books written on Harry Potter. The book is written in easy to read sections and is understandable to those who have not taken philosophy courses. Great for parents who enjoy the stories and want to explain to their children what moral decisions Harry must make and the morality of the decisions he does make. Though one hasn't had to have read the HP books before buying this one since Kern's book summaries of books 1-5 are excellent. This is a great starting point for any parent who has wondered, "Should my child read Harry Potter?" </span>

                    <span>This book is the most carefully studied, in-depth look at Harry Potter that I've found. It not only discusses the books' morality, but relates it to Rowling's use of history, legend and myth. It is a must for Harry Potter fanatics, but if you haven't read them yet and still want to, save this one for last. <br>I would recommend it to anyone who prefers to read books with substance and without platitude. It's clear, concise style would make it a useful tool for any teacher whose students are reading the Harry Potter books. "The Wisdom of Harry Potter" has a wonderful way of showing how philosophy can be interwoven with literature.<br>Any parents who've had doubts about their children reading Harry Potter will find this an excellent resource. And I would go so far as to challenge any of those people who want to ban these books from their children's libraries to find fault with the logic of this book.</span>
