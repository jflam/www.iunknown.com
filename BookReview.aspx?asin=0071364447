                <span id="Label1">For anyone even considering building, buying, or renovating a metal boat, this must-have resource provides a thorough overview of steel, aluminum, and copper-nickel boat construction. Written by one of the world&#8217;s most experienced small-craft designers, Metal Boats explains the advantages of metal; how to buy it; how to cut and weld it; how to build or refurbish hulls, decks, and superstructures with it; and how to finish it. The book also covers engineering for metal boats, corrosion prevention, interior design and construction, electrical systems, appendages, fittings, and a portfolio of designs for metal powerboats and sailboats.</span>

                    <span>After acquiring a pretty vast library of boat building literature- this is still the most used to reference back to. It is definitely tailored to their processes but these too should be used as models of how the plans should be done also. Cheers</span>

                    <span>As The "Complete Guide to METAL BOATS" is about to be re-printed I thought this a good time to write an 'Author's review'. Over the past few months I have received hundreds of emails from customers expressing favourable comment on my book. When an author writes a book much of the content is usually 'researched' material ... In this case most of what you read in MB came out of my personal knowledge and experiance in designing and building metal boats. I personally find MB a great reference for the the researched material and the many pieces of information that occasionally 'slips ones mind' If you are planning to build or own a metal boat I can recommend this book without reservation. MB will NOT teach you how to weld but it WILL teach a welder how to build and maintain a metal boat. Regards, Bruce Roberts-Goodson</span>

                    <span>I waited with interest for the new edition as was advertised on www.bruceroberts.com website, and talked with the folks at Bruce Roberts, who explained that the whole book was being updated. They were quite helpful, and quite correct. <P>The book explains the "mysteries" and answers most questions regarding building a metal boat whether building from scratch and plans or from a computer cut kit. It explains the differences in the various materials with no great bias and plainly spells out the pluses & minuses of each. Welding techniques and materials are outlined as are methods for fitting out and installing systems. <P>Mr. Roberts-Goodson's writing style is down-to-earth, explaining items in plain English which makes it very easy to understand. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone considering building or buying a metal boat. Additionally metal boats owners would enjoy this book and would use it as a resource for repair and maintenance.</span>

                    <span>I have followed Bruce's career for over 30 years. In that time he has changed from a naval architect who sells hand-drawn boat plans to a designer using the most sophisticated technology to produce first rate boat plans and kits for the perceptive buyer. This revision of Metal Boats has built on that excellent work and explores all current knowledge about steel, aluminum and copper-nickel boatbuilding. I think that the book lives up to Bruce's promise to "turn a welder into a boatbuilder."</span>
