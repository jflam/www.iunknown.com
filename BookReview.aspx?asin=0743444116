                <span id="Label1"><P> <BLOCKQUOTE><B>AS THE GAME REVEALS THE PLAYER, SO DOES THIS BOOK REVEAL THE COACH</B></BLOCKQUOTE> <P> Phil Jackson is the most celebrated coach in basketball today, earning that respect by guiding his teams in Chicago and Los Angeles to an astounding eight NBA championships. The key to his success, he thinks is his ability to understand the complexities of the players as well as the intricacies of the game. With this memorable book, Phil joins his friend Charley Rosen, a former player and coach who knows success at the game's highest levels, to bring new insight to the challenge of coaching and to honor the innate grace of basketball and its players. <P> Jackson and Rosen take you from the cracked blacktop courts of the inner city to the polished hardwood of the country's finest arenas, exposing the demanding reality of professional basketball: a world of glamour, glitter, and greed, in which nobility can still be found in the single-minded pursuit of athletic perfection. <P> From his playing days in college and with the world champion Knicks of the 1970's to his victories courtside with the Bulls and the Lakers, Jackson relates his philosophy of coaching, fondly talks about the memorable players and plays of the past, and candidly expresses his feelings about today's rules and referees. Simply a must for any fan, this book reveals the very heart of the sport, reminding us that basketball is much more than just a game.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book,it goes into Phils career as a player, both in college and the NBA, then it talks about his coaching days in the CBA and in the NBA with the Nets, Bulls, and Lakers. The last part of the book is my favorite it talks about his first season with the Lakers, the problems they had learning the triangle, and the conflicts between Kobe & Shaq. Charley also has a nice interview with Tex in one of the chapters. The book goes more into Phils time with the Lakers than the Bulls, but all basketball fans should enjoy this book. You also get a good idea of what kind of person Phil is.</span>

                    <span>The bulk of the book is Jackson and Rosen alternating chapters. Each talks mostly about his own basketball life. "Who is Rosen?" Well, you are right to wonder. His chapters are of no interest to the avid fan who wants to hear Jackson's story. Pay only 1/2 price for this book, since it's the Jackson half that will capture and maintain your interest.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book to read, but I wouldn't consider it a complete autobiography of Phil Jackson. This book primarily covers the 1999-2000 season where Phil coached the Lakers to their first title since '88. There is very little about his tenure with the Bulls which is why I say that Bulls fans will be disappointed when they read it. And then it switches over from Charley Rosen writing to Phil writing and back and forth. On the positive for Lakers fans, Phil goes into great detail on how he brought a dysfunctional Laker team together and took them to the promised land.</span>

                    <span>This is a quick, fun read without a lot of depth. That is unfortunate, because the theme - an homage to Tex Winter's triangle offense as "pure" basketball - is worth exploring in depth. I enjoyed the book, but the sloppy editing, particularly in Phil's chapters, interfered with that enjoyment. If you haven't read "Sacred Hoops," start there. If you like that one, this is a lesser, but still enjoyable sequel.</span>
