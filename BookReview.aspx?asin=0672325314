                    <span>I won't give this book 1 star simply because there is an error in it. At that rate all the books would only get a star. No, this book teaches the exciting new language Visual Basic.Net and does a good job of it. After 21 days you will not be an expert programmer (it takes more than 21 days to become an expert in any field), but you will have a solid foundation to build on. You will have covered all the basics, and better yet will have an ideah on finding solutions to your problems.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be a superbly written manual for learning Visual Basic and as a reference.  The language is very clear and easy to understand.  Chapters are well structured, making it easy to skip and search through the book if you forget something.  Most important, this book is quite comprehensive and has writing on nearly everything you will encounter in the Visual Basic syntax.
<br />
<br />In addition, the later chapters focus on some features that most VB books dare not explore.  These features include detailed tutorials to databases, web applications and custom user controls.  Those later chapters have come in handy and have made this book an all-in-one reference.  It eliminated the need for other specialized books, such as an introduction to ASP.NET.  Not only does this book teach Visual Basic, but it is an excellent all around reference for the entire .NET platform.
<br />
<br />Novice programmers may find this book too straightforward and boring to read.  If you can be easily confused with programming, or prefer to learn at a more humorous and relaxing environment, then I recommend one of the "Visual Basic for Dummies" books.  If you already have some experience writing software and are interested in getting to the hardcore Visual Basic right away, then "Sam's Teach Yourself Visual Basic .NET 2003" is an excellent choice.</span>

                    <span>On page 175 he says you can use the form name instead of Me to refer to the form without any other code!  This is crazy.  I giving sams the shadow of a doubt, wrote microsoft and told them about this and said is there something wrong with my VB .NET soft?   They said no.  They said that you cannot do this.  The reason for the 1star is because of the continual use of this error!  Please Correct me if i am wrong.<p> In Visual Basic 6, a special default instance of each form is automatically created for you, and allows you to use the form's name to access this instance. What this means is that the Visual Basic 6.0 code Form1.Text="hello" has the effect of showing the "default" instance of Form1, but it doesn't work at all in Visual Basic .NET. In .NET there is no default instance. Form1 refers only to the class that represents your form, and this class cannot be used without creating an instance.<p> This is why ME.Text = "Hello" works fine while Form1.Text="hello" doesn't work. In Visual Studio .NET, form1 is just a class name. The Text property can only be referenced by instance. 'ME' represents current instance and ME.Text = "Hello" works fine.<p>He did not say how to do this...He just said you could use the forms name insead of ME.  This is incorrect</span>

                    <span>Why such a low raiting?  When i got this book i was excited when i got to page 176 i was sad.  It said that you could simply use "Form1.Visible = False. in place of Me.Visible = False and that is totaly incorrect.  Anyone who programs in Visual basic .Net knows that this feature was eleminated after Visual basic 6.0.    I mean there was no telling you how to go about so you can actually use Form1 instead of ME to refer to the form he just says you can start doing it without doing anything!  This is totally wrong and will confuse any Beginner programmer due to his continual use of this error!  I even went as far as to contact microfsoft and they said you could not do this!!</span>
