                <span id="Label1"><p>All software developers use languages, which are the fundamental tool of the trade. Despite curiosity about how languages work, few developers actually understand how. Unfortunately, most texts on language and compiler development are hard to digest, written from academic platforms for use in college-level computer science programs. On the other hand, <i> Build Your Own .NET Language and Compiler </i> demystifies compiler and language development, and makes the subjects palatable for all programmers. </p>  <p>This practical book presents techniques that you can apply to everyday work. You&#146;ll learn to add scripts and macro languages to your applications, add runtime expression evaluation to their applications, and generate code immediately. Further, you will learn parsing techniques, which are essential to extract information from any structured form of data&#151;like text files, user input, XML, or HTML. As a bonus, the book includes a complete QuickBasic compatible compiler with source code <i><b>that works</i></b>. The compiler illustrates the book&#146;s techniques and acts as a versatile .NET language.</p></span>

                    <span>When Microsoft introduced .NET, one highly touted advantage (implicitly over Java) was that you could write in .NET-aware versions of languages like Visual Basic, C# or Pascal, compile these into .NET binaries and link and run these as one executable. There are all sorts of small details to attend to, but this seems to be the gist.<P>Well, Nilges has taken this one logical step further. He uses an example of writing a compiler in VB.NET. This is striking for two reasons. Firstly, quite aside from .NET, most people who might write a compiler would surely not choose VB, but instead a higher level language like C.<P>But the second example is more important. As he makes clear, you can generalise the book's example into writing a compiler for a new language that you have invented. Of course, the amount of effort needed for your compiler may be far greater than his example. <P>Step back a moment and consider what Nilges has given you. He shows that .NET can be used as a test bed for experimenting with languages. A level beyond most programmers, who write in languages, not write them. Also, by making your compiler in .NET, you get a chance to integrate your language's programs with those of the existing mainstream languages supported by .NET.<P>The promise is there. Though a harder question is how big the potential audience is for this book. He wrote his example in VB instead of C# to maximise this. But ultimately, it may only be researchers in computer science. A select but small bunch.</span>

                    <span>I really thought this book was going to help me learn more about the subject, but it's really a fairly transparent attempt by the author to make a quick buck or two off of the .NET mania. The writing is painful, to say the least, with a heavy dose of hand-waving thrown in. A lot of claims about proper compiler development which are not followed up in the so-called compiler he developed. It doesn't actually generate proper .NET code, so the whole thing is a fraud, and should be recalled. Don't waste your money on this thing, it should be recalled. Apress used to have a reputation for doing better than this charlatan.</span>

                    <span>I have to agree with the "waste of time" review below. This book reads like a C-student's CS notes on compiler technology. Having created compilers for other platforms, I hoped that this book would shed some light on compiling to MSIL. Unfortunately, coverage on this and other key topics is quite sparse. <P>In the book, the author refers to Aho, Sethi and Ullman's classic - "Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools" (The "dragon book"). Especially if you're new to compilers, do yourself a favor - forget this second-rate knockoff and get the real thing.<P>Shame on APress's editors and reviewers for letting this one out the door. Shame on me for per-ordering this mess.</span>

                    <span>The previous review is so off base I just had to comment.<BR>This book addresses one of the most complex topics in computer science: designing and building a language. Most college books on the subject are nearly incomprehensible. This one can be understood, with some work, by most developers.<P>This was definitely NOT a rush job. Yes, some of the copyrights go back to 1998, but this reflects one of the things that makes this book unique. Most books contain code written just for the book: small and simple examples. This book contains a huge amount of code that has obviously been under development and evolving for a long time. The code has a level of documentation, error checking and self-consistency testing that is rare to see even in commercial code, much less sample code for a book. The author may have written the original compiler in a few days, but he himself mentions that he then went on to rewrite it completely as clearly obvious by looking at the sample code.<P>As to the compiler not creating MSIL code, that's only partially true. The author does show how to create MSIL code. In fact, there is a great example where you can see how much faster MSIL compiled code executes. But the complete example runs on an interpreter which is exactly what you would expect from a Quick Basic. It was, after all, an interpreted language.<P>The best part of the book is being able to enter code into the Quick Basic compiler, and watch it step by step as it is tokenized, parsed, and executed. It's like a "visible" compiler, and provides more insight into how a language works than a thousand pages of text could do.<P>This is not a book about the codedom part of .NET and code generation, though there is some coverage of that. Code generation is just one part, maybe the easiest part, of compiler design. This is a book about language design and construction, and how to use those techniques both for traditional languages and even for unique applications such as defining rules for a credit scoring application (the example in the book).<P>This book is not always an easy read (if only because the material is very complex), and the author does digress on occasion more than I liked. But the overall scope and uniqueness, along with some amazing sample code to play with, is enough for me to forgive its flaws and grant it five stars regardless.</span>

                    <span>I have been waiting for a book like this for quite awhile. I've read John Gough's book and although that was too much Pascal for me; it was certainly closer to the topic than this book. This book is both incomplete and off the mark. One of the tools, a BNF Analyzer, is written (poorly) in Visual Basic 6. The downloaded source for the programs don't compile "out of the box" either. This was a rush job or done poorly in someone's spare time. Some of the code is from 1998.<P>Here's the kicker. The author talks about how to write BNF and analyze it, but he actually doesn't use it in his sample compiler. He wrote the compiler manually "in a few days". Then, he talks about producing MSIL, but doesn't, opting for his own opcode syntax with an interpreter. There is no information in this book about producing a compiler that will create .NET code.<P>This was a lazy and deceitful attempt and the author should be ashamed for not taking the time to do it properly using BNF to create the compiler engine and then producing MSIL, which is the whole point of the title "Build Your Own .NET Language and Compiler".<P>He clearly knows what he's talking about, but he tried to throw together a bunch of his compiler knowledge in hopes of making a quick buck. Sadly, I was suckered into it, but hopefully, you'll read this and skip it entirely.</span>
