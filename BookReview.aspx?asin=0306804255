                    <span>I recently reviewed this exceptional book for a college history class:  Benjamin Quarles did an exceptional job in supporting his well-balanced and non-biased arugment that even though widely neglected in history, the Negro  played a significant role in the abolitionists crusade.  Quarles's use of  Primary sources made this non-biased argument possible.  A quick summary of  the book is as follows:  The "new school" movement began in the  late 1820s to the early 30s, and it gave free Negroes the opportunity to  publicly speak their views on slavery and the equality of blacks.  Even  though not all blacks were abolitionists, their general attitude was, as  John Scoble stated in 1853, "'...[to be] true to their brethren in  bonds...and to remain by them whatever the cost'" (p.7).  Whether he  be free-born or slave-born, man or woman, an active aboltionist or a  supporter of abolition, the Negro was true to his brother in slavery.   Evidence of this was shown in Negro reformist sheets, and narratives  written by former slaves.  The kinship Negroes felt toward the slave was  also shown in the formation of anti-slavery societies, in the trips to  England in hopes of gaining anti-slavery support, and Negro participation  in The Underground Railroad.  This book is an excellent account of the  Negro participation in the abolitionist movement, long neglected in  history.  The fact that this book has a well-balanced, greatly supported,  easy to read, and truthful arument, makes it exceptional.  Quarles said it  best when he noted, "To the extent that America had a revolutionary  tradition, [the Negro] was its protagonist no less than its symbol"  (p.249). One will never feel the same about the Negroes' union in their  struggle for freedom and equality, after he reads, Black Aboltionists, by  Benjamin Quarles.</span>
