                <span id="Label1">Aimed at the Java developer who wants to learn XSLT quickly,  <I>Java and XSLT</I> provides an in-depth guide to using XML to  transform data in a variety of Web applications. With a no-nonsense  presentation style and plenty of expert tips, this tutorial will let  experienced developers master XSLT (and related standards) to create  more flexible Web applications.<p>This text distinguishes itself with a  fast-moving tutorial that covers XSLT from the ground up without  getting bogged down in fast-changing XML standards, as is the case  sometimes with other similar books. Combined with XML parsers  (available in Sun's JAXP 1.1 APIs), Java is ready to go to solve  real-world problems with XSLT. The author shows you how to apply XSLT  to real problems, as well as integrating XSLT into your Web  architecture. Early sections of the book show how XSLT can be used to  separate presentation logic from business logic.<p>The first sections  provide the basics of XSLT syntax, then the book moves on to more  advanced searching and looping techniques. (Without traditional "state"  or variables, XSLT requires a different way of thinking. This book does  a good job of showing what's different in XSLT and techniques that can  do more within real applications.)<p>This text's developer focus shows  up early on, with a sample of XSLT used with Apache's Ant build  utility. Later samples are more applicable to general Web development.  A sample online discussion board built with servlets and XSLT style  sheets shows off the fundamentals at work. With good coverage of Sun's  JAXP 1.1 APIs for working with XML in Java, this book anchors its  samples in real Java tools. A final section on wireless interfaces  introduces the advantages of XSLT for transforming online content into  WML for mobile devices.<p>Now that XSLT is a mainstream technology,  more and more Java programmers will want to use it in real projects.  Beyond syntax, this title shows you how to use XSLT to transform  server-side data into client-side interfaces more flexibly. The  practical focus of <I>Java and XSLT</I> is all you need to combine  these two powerful technologies to create more maintainable Web  applications that can reach both desktop and mobile browsers.  <I>--Richard Dragan</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Introduction to XSLT; XML review; transforming  data with XSLT; XPath; looping and sorting; conditional processing;  formatting text and numbers; an XSLT example with the Ant build  utility; review of Web architectures (including XSLT used with EJBs);  compiling style sheets with JAXP 1.1; basic servlet tutorial (servlets  used with XSLT); sample online discussion forum (with XSLT); advanced  XSLT techniques (including session tracking without cookies, servlet  filters, internationalization); tips for XSLT developers (developing,  testing and debugging, performance tips); building wireless Web  applications with WML and XSLT; JAXP 1.1 API reference; and XSLT quick  reference.</span>

                    <span>This book is definitely showing it's age. It covers XSLT as it was in 2001. It's all about having a flexible front-end and serving XML out as HTML and WML, or using it for internationalization. It's coverage of code generation is very, very minimal. There is also very little in the way of advice about increasing processing efficiency. There are also small mistakes; for example the misstatements about CGI and Servlets, which is a common error in Java articles and books.<P>That being said, the examples are well annotated and the XML is highlighted for readability. The code is loosely annotated, which is the O'Reilly style, but it still makes some of the larger code fragments had to follow.<P>As long as you know that this book is a little dated you will find reasonable material in here about XML, XSLT and how to get it into Java. It could use a second edition with more topical material.</span>

                    <span>This book chooses to forgoe some of the more standard tools for XSL translation that are on the market. The author instead uses alternate opensourced implementations (JDOM vs DOM). The problem with this is that in the real world, constraints often exist on your project such that you cannot use alternatives (oh no!). So instead of getting a robust book that explains how to implement DOM and translate, you get a book that wallows in the use of alternate methods and focuses on one thing: creating dynamic HTML. Honestly, this is a rahter tired subject in the XML world. I am more interested in how to translate XML to PDF or RTF or XL. I am not asking for a plain answer, but I was at least hoping for a very beginner approach.<P>I have spent a week trying to get an implementation going and there is so much that I do not understand. I was hoping that this book would remedy that. It, sadly, does not. The example code is too specific to really help with a real world (constrained) application (I am developing for Oracle systems and they include the standard parsers from org.wc3.dom and org.xml.sax, using others requires server updates that are not recommended). I cannot recommend other titles as I have not read many others and the ones I have read are not too helpful.<P>Good luck, but steer clear of this one, unless you don't mind losing fifteen dollars.</span>

                    <span>This book is not what I hope for. Although it has been out for a couple of years the author has not even aknowledged some of the major typos in the book (see O'Reilly web site).<P>Although nicely written in a style that can be fairly easily followed, it is missing a substantial amount of needed reference material. For example in the section on conditional statements it refers to boolean expressions. Nowhere does he provide a list of operators or build-in functions available. You either have to build your own incomplete list gleaned from his examples or go find a good reference book.<P>O'Reilly authors generally do a better job.</span>
