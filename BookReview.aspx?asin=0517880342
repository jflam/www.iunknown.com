                    <span>without a doubt, art wolfe, one of our foremost photographers, has outstanding wildlife work showcased here in color plate after color plate. this book's true value, however, arrives in the discussion between wolfe and martha hill, former picture editor of audubon magazine. for all but those already well-versed in the magazine and book trade, this dialogue will provide deep insights into how to photograph for publication. hill's comments on what does and does not work for various layouts is invaluable. i highly recommend this title.</span>

                    <span>It makes you want to run right out there, after buying more rolls of film of course! This is a wonderful book - so crisp the colors and details. Right before I go out on a fun photo shoot I love to run through it again - inspires me to see and look for MORE - Wonderful book for the Photographer's collection!</span>

                    <span>The Art of Photographing Nature is probably not for the beginning photographer, but once you?ve learned how to manipulate the camera well enough to consistently make good, properly focussed exposures, you ought to look at this book if you?re interested in nature photography.  And I do mean look, because that?s the way this book teaches.<p>This is a book about photographic composition, which is something a photographer must know well to make pictures that are more than snapshots.  Technique is referred to, but if you want a how-to book get John Shaw?s ?Nature Photography Field Guide?<p>Although Hill claims the writing credits and Wolfe the photography credits, this is somewhat misleading.  The form the book takes is to show a picture taken by Wolfe, or more often two, and then have both comment on the compositional choices.  Since Wolfe is one of the greatest living nature photographers and since Hill is the former picture editor of Audubon Magazine, their commentary is illuminating.  I found the comparison between two pictures of the same or similar subject matter, including why they found one better than the other, to be particularly insightful.  It also adds to the discussion that each of them brings a slightly different sensibility to the pictures.  There are even a few sets where the two disagree as to the better picture.<p>As I said before, this is not a technique book, but technique is examined as a way to enhance the composition.  For example, in the section called ?Reading the Light?, the authors talk about how to find 18% gray, to get a standard exposure from a light meter.  But than they talk about how to use that information to make pictures lighter or darker to enhance the subject.<p>There are various methods of teaching.  Some teachers provide principals and then give examples.  Others present the example and then derive lessons from the example.  Most of us benefit by a combination of both approaches.  Usually photography books take the former approach.  Hill and Wolfe use the latter and this book does it as well as any nature photography book I?ve seen.<p>P.S. Even Wolfe?s second choice pictures are a pleasure to behold.</span>

                    <span>not a bad book for the novice photographer: it is conscise with regard to many broad photographic considerations: composition, film stock choice, filters, etc.  as an educational tool targeted towards learning the nuances of discovering unique outdoor lighting situations, then applying it to a natural setting, it ultimately falls short.  i found myself frustrated often with wolfe's minor revelations about a particular image.  he often seemed either not too interested in taking time to make a more thorough investigation, or unwilling to release too much valuable information.  still, the info that is provided is basic enough that it will serve the beggining photographer quite well.  for my experience though, and i am still fairly new to the endeavor, i found it lacking a wealth of new information.  i picked up valuable tidbits here and there, but nothing ever struck me as: "WOW!  that makes perfect sense!"  some of the more interesting info comes from martha hill, who goes about her editorial incite in a sometimes dry tone.  honesty is appreciated!  for anyone who is thinking of sending photographs for potential publishing, she tells it like it is (or so i would guess.)  overall, i would say this is a good book for the first time photographer purchasing his/her first photography book.  for more advanced shooters, the majority of information will be banal...</span>

                    <span>In this book, acclaimed nature photorapher Art Wolfe teams with Marth Hill, former picture editor for Audubon Magazine. Using side by side photo comparisons and speaking from the different perspectives of photographer  and photo buyer, Wolfe and Hill teach the difference between a good photo  and a great one. Highly recommended for those considering marketing their  nature photography.</span>
