                <span id="Label1">This mesmerizing exploration of the most subtle, elusive, and effective form of power is a masterful analysis of civilization's greatest seducers, from Cleopatra to JFK, as well as the classic literature of seduction from Freud to Kierkegaard and Ovid to Casanova. Robert Greene once again identifies the rules of a timeless, amoral game and explores how to cast a spell, break down resistance, and, ultimately, compel a target to surrender. Presenting the timeless profiles of each type of seducer and the twenty-four maneuvers that will guide you step by step in the game of seduction, <I>The Art of Seduction</I> is an indispensable primer of persuasion that reveals the timeless power of this age-old art.</span>

                    <span>Seduction is an art, a beautiful art: exhilarating, enrapturing, addictive. For the uninitiated, beware, stepping through the door of seduction is ensnaring. Enter and there will be no return.<P>The Art of Seduction is a masterful study of this art, and a work of art itself. It is a collection of stories and an academic survey of the history, psychology and technique of seduction: not just seduction of the opposite sex, but the seduction of people, the seduction of the masses.<P>Note, however, that the inexperienced will get little understanding of the art just by reading this book. Seduction is a skill, a skill to learn, to hone, and to grow with. The art of seduction is about developing yourself as a person, and equipping yourself with the ability to charm, to attract, to confuse, to deceive, to please, to pleasure, to indulge, to love.<P>In your journey as a seducer, supplement this book with others. The Art of Seduction is full of insightful theory and abstraction, and will help the more experienced see the bigger picture, fit apparently disparate parts together, and develop as a holistic seducer. For slightly more specific (and simple) techniques of seduction, first try other books like "Make Women Want You" and "How to Win Friends and Influence People". A continuous interplay in the study of the abstract and the specific will help you see both the birds eye view and understand the subtle nuances at the same time - both crucial to your success as a seducer.<P>Also, do not forget practice. Practice is as crucial as study. Without one, the other is useless. Just like the chicken and the egg, neither can exist without the other. Expect to try, succeed and fail, and yet with each failure to grow.<P>A stern warning to all: the ability to seduce is seductive in itself. Do not begin at all if you are not serious about it, for there are no bounds to the Art of Seduction.</span>

                    <span>There's an old French expression: "In every relationship, there is one who kisses and one who is kissed." But when the seducer applies the tactics outlined in this brilliant book, she (or he) experiences both the thrill of the chase and the joy of being adored.<P>Greene's book focuses primarily on the psychology of love, not on sexual technique, because it is better to create love than lust. A sexy body will entice, but even the best physique becomes boring with repeat exposure. Fantastic sex may bind someone to you for a time, but if it's accompanied by a lacklustre personality and a mundane lifestyle the loved one will go elsewhere. You can get sex anywhere, but you can't experience enchantment with just anyone. Of course, once you've seduced the mind and heart you can pick up a nice Lou Paget book. ;)<P>If you study--really study--the psychology of seduction, everyday life will become more exciting. You're mind will be constantly engaged. You'll have uncommon powers of observation. You'll feel powerful and alive! Yes, some of the tactics are nasty, but you don't have to use every one. Just use your own judgement. :)<P>Here are some of the great seducers you'll read about in this fantastic book: JFK, Lord Byron, Cleopatra, George Villiers, Casanova, Benjamin Disraeli, Duke Ellington, Natalie Barnie, Lady Hamilton, Empress Josephine, Marilyn Monroe, Madame Mao, La Belle Otero, Ninon de l'Enclos, Ovid, Evita Peron, Madame Pompadour, Rasputin, Lou von Salome, Stendhal, Tullia d'Aragona, Rudolph Valentino, Yang Kuei-Fei, Oscar Wilde, and Andy Warhol.</span>

                    <span>'The Art of Seduction' is about willfully exploiting other people's weaknesses in order to seduce them. <P>The book deals not only with romantic seduction, but also the type of charismatic seduction that allows certain political leaders for example to wield enormous power over the public. <P>The type of seduction talked about here is more than the everyday level of admiration, it's about how to really get under people skins, how to make them obsessed with you. Not surprisingly the author makes it clear that not everyone can be seduced in this way, that you need to find someone who has some large hole in their character ready to be exploited.<P>The book is divided into two sections. The first outlines different types of powerfully seductive characters - whose traits you might nurture in yourself. For example, the 'Natural' who embodies childhood, playfulness, spontineity and unpretentiousness. The second half of the book outlines a number of strategies and maneuvers to be employed in the seduction process. One example is to 'Stir up the transgressive and taboo'. Another small section explains a number of 'victim' types, their character weaknesses and how to exploit them. For example you may seduce a 'Professor' type - the intellectual who cannot leave their head, by providing an escape to physicality. <P>Many points are illustrated using examples from historical and literary figures, including relative recent examples such as JFK.<P>Although i doubt i will ever consciously use any of the techniques outlined, still I found the book quite perceptive and fascinating. One thing I repeated wondered is why you would want to seduce someone you have such a cynical understanding of the weaknesses of. Still I have no doubt that highly seductive people instinctively employ many of the techniques mentioned. I'm no psychologist, but many of the book's remarks on human nature rang true to me.<P>I doubt the book's usefulness as a Manual for Seduction (those who need self-help book are no doubt seduced by the idea of this!), but I'd recommend it to anyone with a deep interest in how the world works.</span>

                    <span>it's ironic that most reviewers are so serious about whether this books works as a how-to manual on seduction... they missed the point that this is a witty, juicy, lightly intellectual take on the history and psychology of seduction. it transcends any moralist stances and is a wonderfully modern, entertaining read. mischievious and complex. rewarding.</span>

                    <span>Overall a very good book. It's not a step by step seduction guide that would instantly turn you into a modern day casanova. Wouldn't that be graet? It rather gives you some historic perspective on how the 'players' back in the days used seduction.</span>
