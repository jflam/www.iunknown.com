                    <span>I've been using this book as the primary text for my class in
<br />"Network Flow Programming" (senior & graduate level) at the 
<br />University of Tennessee for about 10 years.  Prior to that time
<br />I had used Jensen & Barnes' Network Flow Programming (now long out
<br />of print).  The code in Jensen & Barnes is in FORTRAN (not so fun
<br />or useful for CS majors) and the intended audience seemed to be OR.
<br />Ahuja's code is pascal pseudo-code for the most part, which usually
<br />translates easily into the C language that most of our students 
<br />use.
<br />
<br />For CS students, there is excellent use of algorithm analysis
<br />(big-O) throughout the book, and there are long discussions
<br />about different approaches and algorithms and the complexity of
<br />each.  There is a lot of mathematical notation, but my students
<br />have never had to worry about PDEs and the like here.  Any good
<br />advanced CS student (graduate or undergraduate) will find the
<br />book very worthwhile.  In my course the students must implement
<br />min-cost spanning trees, shortest paths, critical path/PERT
<br />networks (not in Ahuja), max flow, and min-cost flow.  I would
<br />also recommend (for CS majors) Tarjan's excellent (and
<br />succinct) Data Structures and Network Algorithms.</span>

                    <span>This is a good introductory book. I particularly liked the applications of the problems, introduced in the book. The main negative point that I could mention is, the redundant explanations and discussions you might see in different chapters. I would say the volume of the book could have been reduced by some 15%-20%, if the authors had chosen to be more concise. 
<br />The book, Combinatorial Optimization by William J. Cook, et al, is an alternative. It covers a whole lot of topics and is just too succinct, a little more elaboration would have been appreciated !

                    <span>This book contains a lot of great algorithms for network flow theory and it also contains many of the great applications, which are very useful in practice. This book is very completed. Personally, I learn a lot of new things about Multi commodity Flow, which are the use of Lagrangian Relaxation, Column generation, Resource allocation techniques for solving multi commodity flow. There are also the good chapters in Convex cost flow and Generalized Flow and good appendix in complexity. Beside this book is very easy to read and understand. It is a great idea to have if you are in OR or IE major. :)</span>

                    <span>First of all, I am not surprised that the book <br>got so many good reviews: at first look, it is truly<br>impressive, and it is clearly a work of love. I was <br>looking forward to teaching from it.<p>It is quite clear from the reviews though, that the<br>reviewers have not **used** it for teaching; they may<br>have browsed it at most.<p>The first disappointments came very soon in the course I<br>taught. The biggest flaw of the book is the really bad style <br>in which the proofs are written. They manage to be seemingly<br>overflowing with explanation, and at the same time difficult<br>to understand. They gloss over many details: if the teacher<br>tries to skip these, an alert student could easily make <br>him/her look pretty silly.<p>One case in point is the proof of the label correcting<br>algorithm's correctness starting on page 136. I knew this<br>material from before, so I thought preparing class from <br>here would be a breeze. I was wrong: after going back to<br>my notes, and breaking up the mess into several simple<br>claims did I manage to make notes from which I could teach.<br>Whoever missed  the class was helpless, when they looked <br>for explanation in the book.<p>I only remark, that all classes that I taught from this book<br>were at some of the top 10 OR depts at the US... so this is<br>hardly the students' fault.<p>Many exercises are wrong as well, and although the authors <br>claim that they will try to fix the mistakes, they hardly ever <br>reply to reader's comments, as some of my fellow professors <br>told me. <p>I can only compare the style of the exposition to the <br>later written Combinatorial Optimization book by <br>Cunningham et. al. There is a WORLD of difference. <br>One can try to look up for instance, the proof<br>for the label correcting algorithm: the proof in the<br>Ahuja et. al book is practically creaking at the joints,<br>while in Cunningham et. al. it flows lucidly.<br>I suspect that the authors of the latter book wrote it, since <br>they were unhappy with this one; one can hardly be surprised.<p>On the positive side, the plethora of applications presented<br>is truly amazing, and the exercises (when correct) are excellent.<p>To sum it up: A good  book, which could have become a great one,<br>but have not; one which is very useful, but at the <br>same time very hard to use... I think the community would thank <br>the authors for a second, revised edition, that would fix <br>all the mistakes, and all those terrible proofs.<p>A final word: this text received the prestigious Lanchester<br>prize. One may surmise that giving prizes to a textbook<br>would be best done maybe after 5 years, after a book proved <br>its worth in actual teaching in the trenches, <br>so to speak, and NOT based on the first impression that the <br>jury gets.</span>
