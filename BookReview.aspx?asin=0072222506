                    <span>This book is extremely well written and organized with precision.  The few questions that I had while reading this book were due to my simple oversights.  The author, Bonnie Blake, is an excellent author who uses precise examples and leaves nothing unexplained.  Bravo Ms. Blake!!</span>

                    <span>This is simply a terrible book.  As a few reviewers have mentioned, the organization is atrocious.  There are sections on putting Flash on the web before you learn ANYTHING about Flash.  Early chapters continuously assume that you know subjects from later on.  Many of the descriptions of how to do things are simply wrong; I frequently had to stare at the screen agonizing over how to make something work, because following the description did nothing.<p>Do yourself a big favor and stay far away from this book.</span>

                    <span>. .  this book is so terribly written and edited that it was impossible to begin to tackle Flash MX with it, I don't know why I didn't check Amazon first.  By the first chapter I knew this book was going to be useless; three pages into Chapter One she begins a segment called, "Get a Flash File Up On The Web".  Now, why would  you concern yourself with this step, in the beginning of the first chapter of a book on how to use Flash?  That's the way the whole book goes.  A disaster.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be totally comprehensive and very helpful in teaching me the basics of Flash.  It also covers a lot of scripting material.  It is organized in such a way that it makes it easy to go back and refer to various topics I needed a refresher on.  All in all, it was well worth the money.  The online files were a bit difficult to find at first, but they downloaded easily.  Great tutorial exercises.  Easy to understand.</span>

                    <span>I found this book to be very poorly organized and written. It seems to jump from one concept to another with no cohesion from topic to topic, let alone chapter to chapter. For example, to extract all you need to know to create a simple motion tween you find yourself flipping back and forth and using a fairly useless index. Most any other book will properly place all the needed information together, and all the previous chapters give you the needed background, this book does not.<p>The information you need seems to be there, but it's so hard to get to it that this book isn't worth the money. Not only did I get this, I had to spend another 30 bucks just to replace this one with something better organized, and more comprehensive.</span>
