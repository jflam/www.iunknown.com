                <span id="Label1">Breaking the mold of previous "Walking with" offerings, the BBC's <I>Walking with Cavemen</I> sees Professor Robert Winston follow in the footsteps of ancient man in a series that traces the history of humanity from bipedal ape-men (Australopithecus Aphaeresis) to the awakening of the human mind's potential with Homo Erectus. Over four fascinating half-hour installments, Wilson presents an accessible and populist, but still suitably anthropological study on how apes became human and the traits that we inherited from our earliest ancestors.  <p>  Unlike <I>Dinosaurs</I> and <I>Prehistoric Beasts</I>, <I>Cavemen</I> combines CGI with actors to portray the characters in the story of man. Initially this seems to make it far less technically impressive than the earlier programs--memories of Stanley Kubrick's <I>2001</I> are inevitable--but fortunately the acting is superb and the viewer soon forgets that these are people in monkey suits. The series also makes use of a special effect called "deep time-lapse", which shows in a matter of dramatic seconds the thousands of years of geological changes that sped up our ancestors' evolution. Wilson himself takes part in the action as if he is a modern-day naturalist following lions across the Serengeti rather than creatures long extinct. This approach makes for a more immediate as well as poignant interpretation of history: the result is an enlightening and moving tribute to the human journey. <I>--Kristen Bowditch</I></span>

                    <span>I hate to criticize the Discovery Channel, but what programming executive ape decided they needed to dumb-down and Americanize this excellent documentary? The original BBC version, which is what you get here,is vastly superior to the Discovery Channel broadcast of June 15th, 2003. The different vignettes are longer, better narrated (by a British narrator, not Alec Baldwin) and have a real cinematic kind of feeling almost totally missing from the rushed along, tightly edited version we saw on tv. In fact, after viewing this DVD, the Discovery broadcast seems like a mere infomercial for this longer, better version. If you liked what you saw on Discovery, I highly recommend this DVD. It's like watching WWC again for the first time.</span>

                    <span>I haven't seen the DVD version, but if Alec Baldwin is narrating it I won't bother buying it. He is living proof that every village does indeed have its own idiot, and that he should count for 2. He is living proof that devolution does indeed occur! For the money that he was paid, one would think that he would at least try to sound 1) interested and 2) somewhat able to pronounce the words he is paid to say into the camera. Why couldn't Kenneth Branagh narrate this episode of the Walking series? We know that he is an actor, and not a scientist, but he 1) sounds interested and 2) correctly pronounces the names of the creatures he is talking about. Branagh's entertainment background makes the series much more palatable and enjoyable. Baldwin comes across like the village idiot trying to read a primer aloud when he is known to be totally illiterate. His narration is tawdry and strained. Baldwin makes Branagh look like a Rhodes Scholar. What is so hard about saying "Australopithecus Afarensis" correctly? Apparently it was past Baldwin's obviously limited skills. At least he isn't reprising Hamlet! I really liked the material presented, even though Bobo the Chimp could have done it better than blithering Baldwin, and was quite pleasantly surprised that the BBC has made an often esoteric subject interesting and approachable. Both my children (both under 7) loved the previous Walking DVD's and I am looking forward to purchasing the latest one. My only other minor disappointment is that the producers seem to have rushed through this installment as it was only 2 hours in length. I think that when dealing with such an important area of the past of our species, more should be covered and in greater depth, and without the distraction of a has-been actor who hasn't enough professionalism to do his homework beforehand, and who appears as though he is narrating some seedy reality show rather than well researched and produced programming that directly reflects the past of humankind. As a teacher, I have used the previous Walking videos extensively, but am really leery about using this one, as I will have to narrate over the blithering one to correct his mispronunciation of every faintly relevant scientific term.</span>

                    <span>Were did we come from? we were born from our moms , no I mean were did homo sapiens come from? the answers to our evolution is on BBC's Walking with Cavemen." A prehistory timeline of our changes and life, from australopithicus to homo sapien sapien. How did invent our world languages,our house hold tools,our alphabet. The most advanched technology back then were sticks and stones and through centuries of evolution we have the internet and television. way Before our parents & grandparents these were are family members, our ancestors. If your interested in our prehistory, this is a good DVD for that. Remember if today were like back then, this DVD wouldn't exist. Thank earlier humans for evolving. see this, It's a blast into the past on a entertainment medium of the present and future.</span>

                    <span>Having watched the tv debut of this series, then the purchased DVD I would have to complement the final product as a better effort, especially from the choice of narration. This topic is very difficult to do, especially with animation of human-like animals where we can be more critical than with dinosaurs. The story lines are a bit tedious but interesting. Still it is difficult to believe we can reconstruct the behavior of the apes and human predecents based on our current database. I still think the effort is worthy. The graphics are very well done, possible not appropriate for a young viewer. In one scene the "cavemen" kill a hooved animal and then degut and eat it. My wife sent our 7 year old out of the room on that one! Perhaps it is such realism that makes the Walking With series so well received. Overall a good effort and worthy purchase for such a difficult and challenging subject.</span>

                    <span>Having now seen both verisons I have to say the uncut BBC two part production is the best. Longer, doesn't spoon feed you and the DVD has LOTS of extras - fact files, photo gallery, storyboards, post-production interviews and even 'on location' interviews with actors, the movement director and the effects supervisor. Why buy hamburger when you can get steak?<BR>Seems much longer than just 100 minutes - lots of details and solid story telling.</span>
