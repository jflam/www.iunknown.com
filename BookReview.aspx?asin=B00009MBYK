They wanted to see how to get to the edges, how to create something remarkable.    Well, I found 99 remarkable people, products, services, organizations and projects and wrote about each one of them.     That's it. About 15,000 words. Read it fast.</span>

                    <span>As a followup to his book Purple Cow, Seth Godin has compiled this eBook with 99 examples of Purple Cows in action. (Check out Cow 99 if you want to learn more about why you're hearing more talk about Purple Cows these days!) <P>As a sometime innovator, often early adopter and frequent sneezer (guess you could say I was purple, when purple wasn't cool...) it didn't surprise me to see numerous examples of products and services that I am delighted to use on a regular basis. <P>This companion to the Purple Cow is a valuable way to take the message of the importance of being remarkable to others. Chances are, you'll find a company you know (maybe even one of your competitors) in this eBook. Read it for ideas on how to make your business remarkable!</span>

                    <span>99 Cows is a super accompaniment to Seth Godin's Purple Cow, a manifesto for the remarkable. Although it's not really a "workbook" in the traditional sense of the word, it will give you more ideas on harnessing the power of purple after you read about the reasons why you should in Purple Cow.<P>It didn't surprise me to find that many of the companies, products and Online services that I consider cool are purple cows, since I would consider myself a sometime innovator, usual early adopter and constant "sneezer," (you might say I was purple when purple wasn't cool ;^)<P>The 99 cows in this book are great examples of the kinds of ideas that make people like me take notice of you and your company, buy your products or use your services, and, most important, become the kind of raving fans that tell others about you. Word of mouth is the most powerful marketing there is. As usual, Seth Godin provides great examples of its power in action.</span>

                    <span>Nothing puts a point across better than a story. And hardly anybody tells a more meaningful and uproarious story than Seth Godin. Learning can be a whale of a lot of fun, but not many authors seem to care much about that. Seth sure cares. That's why I felt so good as i was absorbing many of the life lessons that I learned in the book. <P>Readers should thank Seth for getting to the point, cutting to the chase, writing on the bottom line and saving us time. I've read 500-page books that were less meaty. Then again, everything around is less meaty than 99 cows.</span>
