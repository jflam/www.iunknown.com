                <span id="Label1">Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry first published <I>The Little Prince</I> in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. "In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey," the narrator recalls. "Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket." And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p>  The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <I>Invisible Cities</I>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exup&eacute;ry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary:  <blockquote>I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote>  The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <I>Peter Pan</I>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <I>The Charterhouse of Parma</I> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. "Trying to be witty," we're told at one point, "leads to lying, more or less." But Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <I>--James Marcus</I> </span>

                    <span>I thought this was an extraordinary book. It taught me so many things about growing up and all about life. Some people found it hard to understand because of the metaphors, but i think it's just a matter of whether you want to take the time to understand it or not.<BR>When i started reading "The Little Prince," i thought it would just be another boring book that was assigned to us, just to waste our time. This was so much more than just a book i was forced to read, it was one of the very few that i enjoyed reading. From talking flowers to laughing stars, this book kept me interested.<BR>I followed the boy through the journey of his life from the unhappy parts such as the baobabs, to the happy touching moment such as the laughing stars. This is a truly touching book and i plan on reading it again some time in the future.</span>

                    <span>One of my absolute favorites. <P>This book is something you read as a child; it was magical and it held you in ways you could not understand. And there were so many things in it that seemed above your young head. But you think you get them at the time.<P>You read it again when you're older....<P>and it's all the more magical. <P>You understand - completely. <P>Everyone should read this book at least twice.</span>

                    <span>I read this book in my 5th grade class last year, and I loved it!!! It was so wonderful and really made you think about life, death, and that the things that are really impoortant are invisable! I REALLY SUGGEST YOU READ THIS BOOK!!! It brings you to thinking about imaginary things that everyone dreams about (that are extremely real in this book). So live your biggest dream and READ THIS BOOK!</span>

                    <span>This books is just not my type of book. I did not really get anything from this book because I have to go over the metaphors before I can understand it. Anyways, this book tells the grown ups all over the world that they can still use their imaginations even though they have matured and have a job. This is some connections I heard from Einstein. Einstein said that Imaginations are more important than knowledge because Imagination creates knowledge. This book made me read it even though I wasn't very interested to it because it makes me think deeply of some words that are hard to understand and while I read the book, it reminded me of my childhood because I use to use my imaginations, ofcourse, probably all the kids use their imaginations. Now that I have grown, I forgot about imagining because I've grown up a lot. Just like in the book, when the little prince was growing up, he is losing his imaginations.</span>

                    <span>The Little Prince is a book full of wonders. It brings out the real thoughts of things you wouldn't really think about. After reading this book, I was a little perplexed by what all of the authors figurative language meant, but after a long time of thinking I understood what it was all about. It is about love and friendship and thinking deeply about or for something or someone. There was one sentence that really came out of the book and caught my attention. It was "What is essential, must be seen with the heart". This really made me think about how true it is. There are so many feelings and emotions that are only seen with the heart. And one of them is love. It is the most essential emotion of all. That is why I think the main themes in this book are love and friendship. I have learned a lot from this book as well. One main thing that I have learned is how to identify figurative language. It might be confusing at first, but after you understand, you feel really good about your self. If you want a very good book to read, don't choose this one, but if you are a figurative kind of person, then this is the book for you.</span>
