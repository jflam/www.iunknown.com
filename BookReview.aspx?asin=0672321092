                    <span>This book is a lifesaver.  If you have done non-OOP development and are trying to learn Java and OOP, this book may be for you.<p>I find other Java books do not do enough to tie-in the big picture.  Even after reading Eckel's Thinking in Java (among others), I found I was not really thinking in OO terms.  I still had the procedural mindset. I have looked into other OO/Java topics for help in areas such as design patterns, UML, and unit testing, but was having trouble putting it all together.  Too many books and instructor-led courses save these topics for later - after bad habits with regards to Java have emerged.<p>Even though it is a SAMS book, Teach Yourself OOP in 21 Days does an excellent job of bringing it all together early and often.  The author wastes no time introducing the UML and patterns in a clear, easy-to-understand format.  He even explains and provides code for unit testing (via JUnit).  <p>This book does not teach Java - but it does teach you how you should think about and implement Java applications.  I highly recommend it as a companion text to an "Intro to Java" course - espeically for those with previous non-OO development experience.</span>

                    <span>Sam's "Teach Yourself Object Oriented Programming" is a welcome addition to your Java arsenal. Whenever I've started a new language in the past, I would start with a Sam's book for an overview on the subject, followed by a Wrox series book to get more depth, followed by an "Unleashed" or "Professional" book.<br>    This Sam's book is more than an overview. It teaches the full scope of OOP which is what Java is all about. If you need a solid foundation in Java, Sam's Teach Yourself OOP is the way to go.</span>
