                <span id="Label1"><i>Pillar of Fire</i> is the second volume of Taylor Branch's magisterial three-volume history of America during the life of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Branch's thesis, as he explains in the introduction, is that "King's life is the best and most important metaphor for American history in the watershed postwar years," but this is not just a biography. Instead it is a work of history, with King at its focal point. The tumultuous years that Branch covers saw the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the beginnings of American disillusionment with the war in Vietnam, and, of course, the civil rights movement that King led, a movement that transformed America as the nation finally tried to live up to the ideals on which it was founded.  </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I will begin by stating that the negative reviews revolving around the laborious nature of the book are correct but inevitable.Branch has bitten off a great deal in this book.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that his series is not a biography of King nor a book about the civil rights movement - it is a detailed survey of American history from 1954 to 1968 through the lense of the civil rights movement. Branch argues that this is the core narrative of that period of time. Because of this, Branch must cover a great deal of ground - from the inner conflicts within the civil rights movement to the inner workings of the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses to Vietnam to the Beatles landing in New York.
<br />
<br />This creates a very long book that can be hard to follow but is well worth it. In addition, one needs to know that, despite this being 1963-1965, the first third of the book covers a period (Birmingham and the Kennedy assasination) that he had already covered, if somewhat differently, in the first book. This is a neccessary evil for the nature of his narrative. 
<br />
<br />As laborious as it seems, I feel Branch is more than up to the task. I really cannot fathom how much research he has had to do. 
<br />
<br />The years that branch covers in Pillar of Fire are the mountain top years of the King-lead civil rights movement.
<br />
<br />After the assasination of JFK they get a president in the white house who actually appears to agree with them on most issues and is willing (most of the time, with a little prodding) to do something about it.
<br />
<br />The result of this is the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts - the two pillars of american civil rights law. This does not come without a struggle, however. 
<br />
<br />The movement is beset by forces from within and without that threaten to undo their good work - including King's own personal demons. It also witnesses the rise of Malcom X - who raises serious, legitimate questions about the purpose, ethics and viability of nonviolent social action. 
<br />
<br />The book climaxes (sort of) with King in Oslo, Norway recieveing the Nobel Peace Prize. But King is not destined to stay on that mountain top. The relationships within the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Comittee (SNCC) - the group that continually challenged King to do more - began to devolve. King is confronted by the (correct)realization Hoover's FBI is using survelance to cover every word he says.  King also begins, very early, to take a position against the Vietnam War, leading him into confrontation with LBJ - his previous ally in the white house. 
<br />
<br />The mountain top experiences of 1963-1965 were wonderful but, for King, as he said, the valley calls. </span>

                    <span>I read this book after having read Parting the Waters a few years ago. Pillar of Fire book is a hard read but worth the effort if you want to know about the years being discussed.<p>I was born in 61 in Canada and had no clue about what segregation meant. The anecdotes in Parting the Waters gave me a better idea of why this was such a big deal -- probably the lynch pin of modern American history.<p>This second volume Pillar of Fire struck me with a different theme. Taylor Branch uses an artful juxtapositon and parallel of Malcom X and Martin Luther King. Playing these two men side by side helped me understand the strength of will it took to follow the path of non-violence on the part of King et al.<p>The episodes of unrighteous racial oppression and police violence make your blood boil. On one hand we have Malcolm X --the man so like most of us -- who reacts in anger and speaks of vengance. In contrast we have Martin Luther King who holds true to the message of non-violence and in so doing probably saved our nation from much bloodshed later on.<p>The laborious detail can be overwhelming but is probably necessary to drive home the point.</span>

                    <span>I loved 'Parting the Waters' so much that I was not surprised to be somewhat disappointed by its successor. I suppose that Branch just could not bring off the heroic drama of his earlier book. However, let it be said straight away, that on its own this stands as a worthy book on the fight against segregration from 1963 to 1965, encompassing roughly the years from the March on Washington to after the 'Freedom Summer' in Mississippi and the Selma confrontation in Alabama.<p>On the minus side, I found the early chapters downright confusing. Several incidents overlap with the earlier book, so that there is some duplication, and repetition. In some cases detail seemed over-elaborate, in others matters seemed to skip along in cursory fashion. <p>However, the chapters on the Freedom Summer and the Selma conflict are up to the standard of 'Parting the Waters'. Unfortunately, this begins halfway through the book, and it was only then I felt the same fascination with the earlier work.<p>Narrative history has its problems - the writer convering a large subject must capture the epic sweep, while also the flavour of individual experience. Branch captured this magnificently in 'Parting'.<p>In particularly, the student of the SNCC together with Bob Moses are fascinating. King (and this was an issue I had with the earlier work) is a protagonist without any analysis - his character and achievements are taken for granted, so as a biographical assessment of a life, Branch is not adequate. However, I like the way 'villains' like J.Edgar Hoover did get their point of view, though in the case of this man, does anyone now see him as a colossus of law-enforcement, as his contemporaries did? A heavy hint of voyeurism arises from his obsession with King's sex life.<p>All told, worth buying and worth reading, and we await with eager expectation the next volume.</span>

                    <span>Presenting an authentic and comprehensive picture of the mammoth civil rights movement in the United States in the post WWII era is a daunting task, yet noted author and journalist Taylor Branch has succeeded masterfully with this, the second of a planned three-volume history of the struggle of blacks in America to find justice, equality and parity with the mainstream white society. Detailing the final desperate years of the mature and charismatic Rev. Martin Luther King, Branch sets the stage for a wide range of events, personalities, and public issues. This is truly a wonderful read, fascinating, entertaining, and endlessly detailed in its description of people and events, and quite insightful in its chronicling of the fortune of those social forces that created, sustained, and accomplished the single most momentous feat of meaningful social action in our nation's contemporary history. <p>His range of subjects is necessarily wide and deep, and we find coverage of every aspect of the tumultuous struggle as it reaches into the final desperate efforts of the mature Martin Luther King, a man haunted by efforts at blackmail, internal bickering and dissension, and racist hatred as he continues the efforts to rectify the social evils of segregation and works toward greater civil rights and justice under the law. As in the first volume, this work at times borders on becoming a biography of Martin Luther King and his times, yet Branch so extends his coverage of the eddies and currents of the movement itself that it appears to be by far the most comprehensive and fair-minded treatment of the civil rights movement published to date. Indeed, in detailing these critical years of the movement, Branch offers a wonderfully recreated portrait of all of the participants in this momentous and historical struggle, illustrating just how close to the breaking point our society came during these fateful years, and therefore memorably engages the reader with every element of this and a thousand other personalities, issues, and events that helped to carve out the history of our country for almost twenty years. <p>Here one finds a very detailed coverage of the rise of black firebrand Malcolm X and how he influenced the ongoing movement, of J. Edgar Hoover, perpetually obsessed with King and his sexual exploits, and of Lyndon Johnson, who, acting out of his concern for his dream for the Great Society, forcefully twisted the forces of the U.S. Congress toward accepting meaningful civil rights legislation. So too, do we find lesser known names and personalities covered, from Diane Nash to Robert Moses to Fannie Lou Hamer, all of who played critical and fateful roles in the unfolding of the civil rights movement. The names and places and events described here are legion, and one gets the sense that anyone who had a conscience was involved, and many of the names mentioned later went on to greater accomplishment and further noteworthy contribution in their public lives and careers. <p>This, then, is a stupendous second book in a wonderful planned three-volume history of the civil rights movement in the United States; the first volume covered the period from the late 1950s when the first rumblings of the movement were sounded until just after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas in November of 1963. This second volume picks up the thread thereafter, extending out through the Johnson years and including aspects of the coalescence of the movement with the Vietnam anti-war protest. This is a wonderful book, and one I would consider essential reading for anyone with an interest in American history in the 20th century. I highly recommend both of the books already published, and I hope you appreciate reading them as much as I did while we wait for the arrival of the third and final volume. Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>As most other reviewers, I too was eager to get into Pillar of Fire after a friend recommended his first book to me, Parting the Waters. Although POF is an excellent, thoroughly written book by Branch, it just misses the superb quality of PTW.  What PTW gave us about the backgrounds of the central figures and the story line of key incidents, I felt POF was missing some of that and that Branch just couldn't get himself out of the White House documents. Not that I'm trying to dimiss JFK and LBJ's civil rights commentary as frivilous, but I wanted more of the front line drama out of St. Augustine, Florida, Meridian, Mississippi and other hot spots. The other thing I wish Branch would have included was more about Malcom X's background and how he became a muslim in prison.  <p>Aside from my nit-picking, I really enjoyed this book and will definitely read the third installment. Although the White House chapters were a bit too long at times, it was fascinating to learn of Hoover's under-handed tactics to try and quell the movement and hunt out the 'Communists' that influenced MLK. I guess we had our very own NKVD police force right here in America during Hoover's days in power. I had heard inklings of the black-mail suicide tape Hoover sent MLK and was glad Branch gave the full story. Another great aspect of Branch's writings is how he touches on all of the movement groups such as SNCC, CORE, SCLC, etc. Branch gives Bob Moses' actions in Mississippi the credit it deserves whereas so many other writers just seem to gloss over his contributions.<p>Contrary to a few reviewer's complaints, Branch's writing style is NOT hard to follow (even though he jumps around quite a bit) and this is NOT a hard book to read. It reads like any other high-quality historical work so if you're expecting it to read like Harry Potter, you might want to stick to Brokaw's history books. Normally, I'd give a book like this five stars but because I know Branch can do better (like Parting the Waters), I can only give it four.<p>On a side note, if any reader wants a better idea on who Taylor Branch is, check out Spike Lee's documentary "4 Little Girls" on the Birmingham church bombing. Branch does some commentary work in it.</span>
