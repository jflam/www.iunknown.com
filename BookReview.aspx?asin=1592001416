                    <span>I had some experience in scanning slides and negs, but this book helped me a lot. It had exactly what I was looking for in terms of information, explanations, tricks, techniques, and background material. I believe this is the only book being sold that is dedicated to film and slide scanning for the "average Joe" so anyone who wants to improve their scans should look no further.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent introduction to capturing digital images of transparencies and negatives, but it also serves as a valuable resource for the more experienced worker. It includes everything you wanted to know about this topic, and quite a few things you did not know you needed to understand, so I'd say this was a very comprehensive book. I can't recommend it highly enough to everyone interested in scanning.</span>

                    <span>I'm an experienced 35mm photographer switching to digital scanning, and I found this book to be the perfect complement to my scanner's rather basic instruction manual. In a clear and straightforward manner, it addresses a wide multitude of scanning situations, from the most basic to the most complex. Each of the things you need to know is concisely explained and extremely well illustrated in a most logical progression of sections. The table of contents and index are wonderfully comprehensive and make finding what you want as simple as possible. I'm very pleased that all of the illustrations were are color. All in all, this book is most highly recommended for both the beginner and advanced scanner users.</span>

                    <span>Wonderful book. Lots of solid information about scanning slides and negatives, well presented, good illustrations, plenty of ideas on what to do with your scans. Anyone who wants to learn more about scanning can't go wrong with this book. Tells about scanning with both flatbed scanners and film scanners, and I own both, so this worked for me. I've been scanning for more than a year now, and still managed to learn some valuable tips. It helped me get improved results.</span>

                    <span>I looked all over for a book about scanning slides and was very glad to find this one. It had all the info I needed and was very easy to understand. This book is good for beginners and intermediate readers, because it contains both good introductory material as well as more advanced tips and tricks to help you get the best quality scans from your film.<P>I liked the software recommendations and description of how film scanning works. I was able to get better results scanning slides with both my Nikon film scanner and Epson flatbed scanner after I read this book. Thanks for a great book.</span>
