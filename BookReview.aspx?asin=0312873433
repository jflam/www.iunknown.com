                <span id="Label1"><div>On July 20, 1969 the whole world stopped.  It was a day in which a man who grew up on a farm without electricity would announce, "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."<br><br>In this, the first ever biography of Neil Armstrong, Leon Wagener explores the man whose walk on the moon is still compared to humankind's progenitor's crawl out of the primordial ooze.  And whose retreat back to a farm in his native Ohio soon after the last ticker tape confetti fell, has left him looked upon as a reclusive hermit ever since.<br><br>This is the true story of a national hero, whose life long quest to walk on the moon truely mirrors our best selves, an American who braved incredible danger daily over a long career, finally achieving what seemed impossible, and broke free of the Earth's surly bonds proving forever that man can reach for the stars, and  succeed.<br><br>Relying on hundreds of interviews with family and friends of the astronaut, plus generous access to the NASA files, Leon Wagener explores the life of one of America's true heroes, in a book filled with extraordianry adventure, and even greater achievement.<br></div></span>

                    <span>This summer will mark the 35th anniversary of the first moon landing and Neil Armstrong's famous "one small step." Journalist Leon Wagener does an admirable job of presenting Armstrong's life story in this first-ever biography. At first glance, it may seem surprising that three and a half-decades have passed since that historic journey without a book-length account of Armstrong's life; but given the former astronaut's well-known reticence, it's more easily understood. Wagener has mined official sources and conducted more than 100 interviews in putting together this account; but sadly, Armstrong was not among those who chose to participate. Wagener has apparently managed to track down just about everyone who has known or worked with Armstrong, including his brother, classmates, fellow soldiers and aviation pioneers, business associates and others.<P>The Neil Armstrong who emerges in these pages is a remarkably driven person, who, growing up in the Ohio of the 1930s, dared to dream the seemingly impossible dream: that he would one day set foot on the moon. Armstrong's love of flying developed at an early age and was nurtured in college, during his service in the Korean War, his work as a test pilot in the 1950s, and his enrollment as one of the second generation of astronauts in the early 1960s.<P>Wagener's account begins with the launch of Apollo 11, then follows Armstrong through the years leading up to that defining journey. He also offers a throughout account of the aftermath of the flight, when Armstrong and his fellow shipmates Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins spent months journeying the globe as good-will ambassadors for NASA and their country. Also recounted here is the ironic fact that even at the space agency's moment of ultimate triumph, its base of political support was eroding; this saw the start of the budget cuts and shifting of priorities that have left the post-Apollo NASA a shadow of the proud agency of the 1960s.<P>Although the primary focus of this work is on the decades leading up to Apollo 11, Wagener also provides a good synopsis of Armstrong's post-astronaut career, including his decade as a university professor, his work as a pitchman for Chrysler, and his sometimes uncomfortable role as a living legend.<P>Wagener's text is well-organized, and his prose is vivid and engaging, though it does become a bit purple at times. But perhaps that's to be understood, and forgiven. It was President Nixon, who, upon Apollo 11's return, proclaimed that week the greatest in history since the creation. Wagener has managed to re-create the awe and majesty of that moment, and for that, he deserves thanks.--William C. Hall</span>

                    <span>The marriage between author and publisher can be a chancy thing. Here we have a good biography of Neil Armstrong, first man to set foot on the moon. The book appears to be well-researched and credited.<P>Unfortunately, the publisher did not do as much work as the author. This is immediately obvious by the photo of Buzz Aldrin on the cover. There is a tiny image of Neil Armstrong reflected in the faceplate, but the main image is Aldrin. Aldrin's name tag is clearly visible through the "A" in the word GIANT.<P>But if you can ignore having the wrong man on the cover, the insides are worth reading. Neil's adventure is one of the great achievements of the last fifty years and has had far too little actually written about the men themselves.<P>This is a wonderful addition to the library of any fan of the space race.</span>

                    <span>Any would-be biographer of Neil Armstrong faces three major challenges. First, everyone knows (and many have written aboout) the central event of Armstrong's public life: the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon. Second, Armstrong is a fiercely private person who rarely speaks in public and has never (to my knowledge) consented to an interview since leaving NASA. Third, science writers like Andrew Chaikin ("A Man on the Moon") and astronauts like Michael Collins ("Carrying the Fire") and Gene Cernan ("Last Man on the Moon") have set the bar *very* high for those who have come after them.<P>Leon Wagener's new biography of Armstrong fails on all three counts. It adds little to what we already know about Armstrong's career, offers minimal insight into Armstrong the person, and is marred throughout by a grating prose style and abominable editing.<P>Wagener's biography is a patchwork of interviews with friends and family members, quotes from newspapers and magazines, and gleanings from NASA records. This works reasonably well in the first and last sections of the book: Wagener is the first writer to deal in detail with Armstrong's life before coming to NASA (in the late 1950s) and after leaving it (in the early 1970s). Few readers, however, would pick up a book-length biography of Neil Armstrong *solely* to learn about those parts of his life. The method breaks down, however, in the long mid-section of the book, where the subject is Armstrong's years in the space program. Here, piecing together the facts is not enough: We already know the story. We *want* to know what Armstrong thought about it all, and that is the one thing that Wagener cannot deliver.<P>Even the relatively effective parts of the book are undone, however, by the quality of the writing. Writing about some of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century, Wagener tries relentlessly to pump up the drama by adding adjectives to every noun, adverbs to every verb, and extra clauses to every other sentence. There is nothing inherently wrong with this kind of dramatic prose--Norman Mailer used it in "Of A Fire On The Moon" and Tom Wolfe used it in "The Right Stuff"--but Mailer and Wolfe are masters of the English language. Wagener has a tin ear, and it shows on every page. The difference between the right word and the almost-right word, Mark Twain famously wrote, is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. This book is infested with lightning bugs.<P>It is also, sadly, infested with factual errors. Navigation lights twinkle in airless space, the invention of the turbojet engine is attributed to the wrong person (and placed in the wrong year), the X-15 rocket plane is misleadingly described as a hypersonic glider (a description that fits the never-built X-20 far better), and the Ford Trimotor is inexplicably described as a weapon of war (which the later and superficially similar Junkers Ju-52 eventually became, but the Ford never did).<P>Readers have not been well served by Wagener's editors, who should have at least thinned out the factual errors and style-deaf sentences. Nor have they been well served by the decision (by the author, editors, or both) to omit *any* form of references, bibliography, or even a complete list of interviewees. Readers interested in the sources of specific details are left with no way to *find* those sources. Especially given the numerous factual errors (which would make double-checking essential for anyone wanting to use the book as a reference), this is goes beyond frustrating into outrageous.<P>Historians interested specifically in the pre- and post-NASA phases of Neil Armstrong's career may want a copy of this book. Others should avoid it at all costs.</span>

                    <span>Although this book provides the basic facts of Neil Armstrong's life and career, it lacks substance. After reading 300-plus pages about one of the country's ablest test pilots and the first man on the moon, the reader comes away scarcely knowing anything about what motivated Armstrong or how he was viewed by his contemporaries. One of the century's most interesting characters remains a mystery.<BR>Additionally, this book could have used a good editor. Careless spelling mistakes diminish its effectiveness. The name of Alan Shepard, for example, is spelled incorrectly throughout the text and also in the index.<BR>Here's hoping that a better Armstrong biography finds its way into print soon.</span>

I really enjoyed reading about Neil's experiences in the Korean War.</span>
