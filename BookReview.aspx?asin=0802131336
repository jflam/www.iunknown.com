                    <span>Hawilson's comments (below) reflect a very limited mind. I know Toby Schneebaum, and have no doubt in my mind that this book is, indeed, non-fiction. Schneebaum is in every way a remarkable man. The reader should celebrate the world depicted in this book, not feel threatened by it, thereby dismissing it, as hawilson has done.</span>

                    <span>If the life of this man seems incredible, it is because the man himself is incredible. I have just seen the world premire of a documentary entitled "Keep The River On Your Right" in which Tobias returns with the filmmakers and relives his journey through Peru.He is 78 years old and not only did they find some of the tribes-people that he lived with while there, those same people remembered him, after 48 years. There need be no more proof of the validity of his book than that. <P>Even beyond the text of this book, Tobias's life offers a larger lesson, and that is one of acceptance and understanding of every human being and culture. I hope that people will continue to read this book and that this message will be taken into the hearts of the readers as a new way to live life.</span>

                    <span>Schneebaum is an unusual man. When you first hear of him you might think maybe too unusual. Thats where you need to look at the man and his journey from a larger perspective. The book has much to tell us about about respect for other cultures and about how to relate to people who don't see the world in the same way we do. If you keep an open mind, you will enjoy getting inside the mind of a very caring and empathetic man.</span>

                    <span>We see from Stephen O. Murray and his ilk, a desire to suppress this important journey and its journal, by pretending it is not 'scientific'. Schneebaum describes himself as a 'Painter' - not an anthropologist, and nor does he attempt to write in a scientific way. <P>Insight into our own ignorance is an important part of scientific study; on occasion it can be a sufficient condition. I congratulate Schneebaum for making this and other journeys, and for the memoirs these create. <P>This is most certainly not a textbook, or anything resembling a scientific treatise or paper. It is a stained glass window, decorated by Schneebaum's own homosexuality (sexual fantasy and desire). He views the 'cannibals' from this perspective, and they view him in an equally astounding way. I recently saw Schneebaum on TV, and his current boyfriend explains Schneebaum's desire for an 'aroused native'. Re-read this book from Schneebaum's perspective, and a flood of insight into this important people is revealed; rather like the Sun bursting through the colored window, illuminating the dark room within.<P>Reviewer S. O. Murray appears to consider himself a voice of authority; possessed indeed by an intellect surmounted only by his overwhelming ignorance. His reviews are based on conjecture, rather than the content of the book or document reviewed. Ignore him, he is just incapable of understanding; blinded by the heavy drapes over his window.</span>

                    <span>i had to buy this for a course in mesoamerican religion. there wasn't any in it, nor any anthropology either. just a lot of lame existentialist homosexual fantasy. probably when it was published in 1969 (and when it was written even earlier) it was a lot more interesting and thought-provoking to point out that the christian religion practiced by the priest at the mission did not make anyone any happier (or any better people) than whatever cultural norms being practiced by the more "primitive" peoples; that's old news for most of us today. there is no mention of any other spiritual beliefs than christianity, therefore no objective comparison can be made. i haven't seen the documentary yet, but proving that he really went somewhere, met someone, and visited a tribe doesn't come close to proving all the incidents described in the book.</span>
