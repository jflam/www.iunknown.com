                <span id="Label1">You're either a Purple Cow or you're not. You're either remarkable or invisible. Make your choice. <br><br> What do Starbucks and JetBlue and KrispyKreme and Apple and DutchBoy and Kensington and Zespri and Hard Candy have that you don't? How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last? <br><br> Face it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed -Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few-aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list.  It's Purple Cow. <br><br> Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows-but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. <br><br> In <i>Purple Cow</i>, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place. </span>

                    <span>This is without a doubt simply the most awesome book I have ever read on the subject of marketing.<P>Seth truly gets it and if you buy only one book this year to improve your business this is the one - the book is provoking, challenging and most importantly it will rock your world in the best way be cause if you read and get the message your company, business, job or life will change and change forever.<P>If you really want to connect with Seth read all his other books and make sure that you get the new ebook that came out on the same day as this book its called 99 Cows and it goes further with the Purple Cow strategy by giving you examples all with links.<P>But this book is the one and only marketing book the key to what Seth is saying is that business has to be remarkable if it is to cut through the static and make itself heard.<P>I have one other thing to say BUY THIS BOOK! Then tell everyone you know to get a copy too as the good news always spreads the fastest.</span>

                    <span>How can you pass reading a business-genre book about purple cows - the latest "p" in the marketing buzz? The point is that you can't. Just like how, if you were standing in a field of cows, the purple one would stand out while the rest were boring. The real secret though, according to Godin, is that sometimes it takes as little as changing a color or rotating the title of a book 90-degrees to have a distinct product that consumers want to find out about and purchase: what Godin calls a purple cow. Godin shows us through example how we can change our businesses to be a purple cow and makes a compelling case for doing so. He suggests that any business who doesn't re-invest in cow-creation will be doomed to long-term failure (even if it creates a short-term success)<P>The book is exceptionally well written, jammed-packed with examples and mini-case-studies and will provide you with an extensive "also read" list when done. But more importantly, the fact that we are interested in the purple-cow concept really indicates that it works!</span>

                    <span>I feel suckered. Godin must be a clever marketer to have swindled me out of $15. There is nothing in this book that is remarkable. It's common sense: in order to be successful, you need a remarkable product. Well, duh.</span>

                    <span>There is nothing remarkable about Godin's book on being remarkable. All the info in this book is basic business sense. I am an artist.. how can I possibly sign my name to a painting that I do not feel is original or remarkable?? Anyone who starts a business knows the info in this book. If you didn't think your product was better than others why on earth would you have launched it? Unless you are like really, really dumb.</span>

                    <span>I read an excerpt from this book in Fast Company and had to buy this and the accompanying "99 Cows". This is a great, eye- opening read because of its simplicity and brilliance. You can apply these principles to many things - I have been telling people about the "purple cow" principle as much as possible. If you want to be remarkable, this book has some good ideas to get you started or get you thinking about ways to apply the principles to your own situation. It's a fun read and very refreshing for a business-related publication. I highly recommend reading this and "99 cows".</span>
