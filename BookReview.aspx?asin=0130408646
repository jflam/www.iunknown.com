                    <span>I've had numerous experiences with William Stallings networking books, and all of them are bad.<p>My personal opinion is that he is that though it seems like he knows a lot (though I doubt it), he's not able to get that knowledge across to his readers. There are few examples and the post topic questions have little or no bearing on the subject matter of the chapters.<p>Every one I knew in my networking classes and computer science classes felt the same way about this author. I'm sure there are other better books out there - don't know why lousy prof. seem to  <br>require this for classes</span>

                    <span>Clear, well-organized, and good level of detail.  I was frustrated that so many data networking books do not adequately cover wireless, and this does that perfectly.  There is even a website with PowerPoint presentations and pdf files of images from the text.</span>

                    <span>First of all, this is a high quality book. Hardcover and fine paper makes it a pleasure to handle. The chapters are well organized into four parts, from Technical Background to Wireless Lans.  Beware however, that this is a quite theoretical book. If you are looking for a fast approach to WLAN technologies, perhaps you should try simpler books like O'REILLY's 'Wireless Community Networks'.<br>Nevertheless, it is an ideal textbook for academic purposes. I am using it as a reference for undergraduate courses. Chapters related to Signal Encoding and Spread Spectrum are really well written, and 802.11 and Bluetooth fundamentals are fully explained.<br>Even if several parts of the book are taken (with little or none modifications) from other Stallings' books, the book is still worth to have since this fact makes it a completely self-contained reference.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>If there is one word by which I would have to describe this book, it would be: "complete". The author assumes that the reader has nothing but very basic mathematic and scientific training and takes him all the way from first principles in those disciplines to the details of cellular networks, wireless LANs and Bluetooth to mention three of the latter chapters. The ample usage of illustrations, review questions and www-references position this as a high-quality textbook.<p>Then again, if you are an experienced engineer, looking to solve a concrete problem for the wireless system you are presently sitting in front of, you will find that Stallings' book, because of its breadth of treatment, does not reach the necessary depth. In that case: read one of the many references for further study that the author offers.</span>
