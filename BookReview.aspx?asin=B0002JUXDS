Pennebaker (<i>Don't Look Back</i>) and Chris Hegedus shot behind-the-scenes at command central for Bill Clinton's 1992 election campaign and came up with this film. You won't find the kind of daily damage-control and skirt-chasing indirectly alleged in <i>Primary Colors</i>, but the filmmakers do give us a strong sense of the uphill battle of a presidential campaign. The center of the film is really James Carville, who steered the machine for Clinton's '92 run and who comes across in this film as a deeply passionate, complex, and somehow timeless man who could have fit into any chapter of American history. <i>--Tom Keogh</i> </span>

                    <span>"The War Room", a film by Chris Hegedus and Da Pennebaker gives you unfettered access to the strategists of the 92' campaign to elect Bill Clinton and Al Gore.  The film doesn't have many appearances by President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore, but that's not the point.  The film shows you just how the campaign was won, the emotions that were felt and the ups and downs of running this campaign.
<br />This film gives you an inside look at the truly revolutionary way in which this historic campaign was won.  
<br />The spotlight is on several star strategists of the Democratic Party such as James Carville, George Stephanopoulos and Paul Begala; all of whom are regulars on CNN's Crossfire.
<br />The film is similar to many other notable documentaries on political campaigns (such as Journeys with George), but the emphasis is on those in charge the campaign, you see into their everyday work lives.  The reason why this film was so successful in it's portrayal of campaigning is: this hadn't been done before.  The film makers were looked at as "friend" not a foe trying to get a story for the evening news.  The film makers are party to strategy meetings and every aspect of the campaign.  
<br />As stated in the DVD introduction, this film's historical significance changes everyday as history and current events change.  It's and excellent film and if you like political documentaries, I suggest you give this a try.</span>

                    <span>This celebrated documentary provides a bird's eye view into the inner sanctum of Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus spent three weeks shot 33 hours of film, which was later combined with news footage to capture the cause-and-effect relationship between what happened inside "The War Room" and the election of the president.  There is no voice over narration to this documentary, just clips spliced together.  The dynamic behind it all is the Fire and Ice duo of chief Clinton strategist James Carville and director of communications George Stephanopoulos. Of course, both titles are gross simplifications of their roles in the campaign, and it is impossible not to see "The War Room" as being one of the inspirations for "The West Wing." <p>What stands out in watching this documentary is the complete sense that this is what it was really like, which, in the end, is more impressive than the fact that these guys won the election. Here you get to see the infamous Clinton "quick response" strategy at work, where every attack by the opponent is crushed in an immediate barrage of rhetoric. For me the most memorable sequences were when the Clinton brain trust discover the Bush-Quayle campaign is having its campaign signs printed in Brazil rather than in the U.S., Carville becomes emotional in the final staff meeting of the Clinton War Room, and when he and Stephanopoulos find themselves unsure as to how they are supposed to address the man who is now the president-elect.<p>From the perspective of today it is interesting to compare the Carville and Stephanopoulos we see behind closed doors with their more public personas as talking heads. The Jim and Mary (Matlin) traveling road show that keeps Carville in the political spotlight today might get more of the publicity, but the one who has impressed me the most is Stephanopoulos, whose work on the Sunday morning political roundtable "This Week" established his reputation as one of the most objective and restrained political analysts on the tube of either party affiliation.  That assessment was codified this past year when Stephanopoulos replaced Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts as the hosts of the show.   "The War Room" shows not only where he paid his dues, but gives him his bone fides as well. <p>The final irony is that the one clip showing Al Gore giving a campaign speech is more dynamic than anything we saw during the 2000 election.</span>
