                <span id="Label1">Conservative talk show hosts and newspaper columnists have made an industry out of incessantly deriding the American left, citing liberals for everything from moral decay to bad economic policy to a soft approach on terrorism. Often these accusations are bound in book form and sell quite well. Only one problem, according to Salon.com and <I>New York Observer</I> writer Joe Conason: the charges they're leveling just aren't true. In <I>Big Lies</I>, Conason dissects 10 of the most persistent, and--according to him--glaringly incorrect, arguments made by conservatives. Each chapter begins with a quotation ("Liberals control the media and misuse their influence to promote left-wing politics," "Conservatives are the only true champions of free enterprise"), which is then picked apart using statistical evidence and detailed historical research and rejected. The modern right wing, in the opinion of Conason, is not the bastion of virtue and defender of the common man it claims to be. Rather, it is a calculating and shrewdly efficient group of propagandists fueled by revenues generated by a system that rewards cronyism. Granted, it doesn't take much to deflate the bombast of shrill political talk show hosts whose very living depends on making shocking accusations about public figures, a couple of raw facts usually does the trick, but Conason offers more than simple refutation, going deeper to challenge the presumptions that generate such platitudes. And he navigates a highly readable and informative writing style that feels more substantive than Molly Ivins and Al Franken but still a lot wittier than Noam Chomsky. Many of Conason's arguments, like those of his foes, naturally come down to matters of opinion, and published material can readily be found to back up nearly any perspective. Nonetheless, he presents clear and logical points, and his thinking is well supported by both the historical record and empirical data. Accusing Joe Conason of lies (of any size) would certainly be a difficult task.  <I>--John Moe</I></span>

                    <span>The most noteworthy aspect of Joe Conason's writing is its clarity and concision.  Like some sort of debate monster, he immediately cuts to the core of issues and uses documented research to make his points.  That isn't to say that he's wimpy or nonconfrontational.  Conason lets the reader know exactly how he feels, but without trying to mislead.  He's more than happy to cite the bias of the sources that he quotes, and turns that into another strength-- conservatives' arguments are shown to be fraudulent by their own admission, or at least a simple look at the facts.
<br />
<br />As such, is strikes me as being one of the most useful books out there in terms of presenting arguments in the most effective-- and honest-- means imaginable.  I admire Conason for his level head and cool dememanor.  His media appearances back him up.  Conason has the unflappable attitude of a kung-fu flick Zen master.
<br />
<br />'Big Lies' is a fascinating and quick read, filled with invaluable nuggets of information that any progressive ought to know.  And at the price, you can hardly miss.  Highly recommended.
<br />
<br />Now watch closely as the right-wing zombie brigade checks off my review as un-helpful.  Sheesh.</span>

                    <span>I read this book and Ann Coulter's Slander book one after the other.
<br />
<br />I'm not American, so it was an exercise of personal interest, rather than something I'm emotionally involved in.
<br />
<br />By way of comparison I found this book to be somewhat more rhetorical in nature than Coulter's, and less founded in examples and references. As an analytical writer myself I have to admit to preferring the well documented style of Coulter's book.
<br />
<br />I can see that Americans are pretty divided one way or the other over which perspective they hold, but to a foreigner they're both interesting books.
<br />
<br />I really wanted to like this book too, but I just found Conason a little too heavy on rhetoric, and a little too light on providing well documented examples and references.</span>

                    <span>First, a note to "Malcontent" (1-star review):
<br />Ooooh, someone got a thesaurus!
<br />
<br />Conason's insights, regardless of your opinion of his position, are at least verifiable and rise to a significantly higher level of scrutiny than the trash peddled by Limbaugh et al. Further recommended is Conason's regular Friday appearance on Air America's "Al Franken Show" (www.airamericaradio.com). Again, even if you feel Franken is too extreme in his position, Conason's considered voice of fact rings clear. Conason was reportedly a candidate to square off against Sean Hannity (who now bullies Alan Colmes on a regular basis); it's a shame the extremist right commentators are so fearful of formidable and intelligent opposition.
<br />
<br />Bottom line? Great writer, great book. Also check out "The Hunting Of The President" (now in movie form, and available on DVD).</span>

                    <span>I've read several books with similar themes recently. This book floats to the top everytime. With clarity and focus, Conason makes his case. It's a brilliant indictment of neo-conservatives. If you've been wondering what the hell happened to America, this is where you'll find out. </span>

                    <span>Was sold at my bookstore. For those of you unawear, bias does exist and to prove it ask yourself this: How was the coverage of Bush's nationalguard days treated differently from Kerry's bouts with the Swift boat Vets? Would the New York Times try to smear 260 Guardsmen if they turned on Bush? And last what do you think about many editors stating that they would not have even covered the story if it were'nt for cable news and blogers?
<br />
<br />Maybe it's just common knowlege that the media veers right; that would explain the poor showing for this book. </span>
