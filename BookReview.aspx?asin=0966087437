                    <span>This book gets to the "heart" of the matter - pun intended. "Coaching," according to author Thomas G. Crane, "is a healthy, positive, and enabling process that develops the capacity of people to solve today's business problems." Bingo! Crane focuses on what coaches can achieve focusing their coaching on three principles: building a foundation of trust, learning together, and forwarding the action (and the self) forward. This what Crane calls transformational coaching. Consider it to be the art and the practice of helping others learn about their strengths, their weaknesses, and their opportunities for development. Tightly written and with ample diagrams and charts, this book is a treasure chest of ideas of executive coaches and an easy to follow guide for all managers who desire to coach for results. Don't simply read "The Heart of Coaching," practice its principles and you will help those you coach grow and develop.</span>

                    <span>As a senior manager with a major international manufacturing entity, I am continually educating my superiors, peers and subordinates about the value of developing exceptional coaching skills.  After extensive research, The Heart of Coaching was the written vehicle we chose to develop these skills within our organization.  <p>The most important aspect of this work, that sets it apart from all others, is it's focus on changing yourself and your own behavior rather than changing others.  It is written with a simplicity that creates immediate understanding of the most effective behaviors of leaders who combine "heart" with results.  <p>The results in our organization have been astounding.  Not just a change in the effectiveness of individuals, but a cultural evolution.</span>

                    <span>I own no less than 30 books on coaching and giving performance feedback, and this is the best yet.  I say this for three reasons.  It is structured around an easy-to-understand model.  It is detailed enough to be genuinely useful without being overwhelming. And lastly, it advocates a strong philosophy of genuine caring that is essential to effective coaching.  You can bury people in skills training, but they won't do it in the real world unless they have beliefs and values that support this difficult set of management skills.  Coaching is easy to talk about, hard to do.  This book makes it clear what to do and also encourages the reader to actually do it.</span>

                    <span>The Heart of Coaching is a current and practical guide that demonstrates how coaching is the heart of leadership that creates and sustains an organization's competitive advantage.  Every reader will understand why this coaching model is necessary to create a "high-performance, feedback-rich" culture.  Most important for the busy manager, the author shows exactly how to do that.  Many writers have emphasized the importance of a learning organization for flexible responses to changing demands.  Crane highlights the key role of coaching so that managers can "walk the talk."  If you only want one book on managerial coaching, make it this one.  It's superior.</span>
