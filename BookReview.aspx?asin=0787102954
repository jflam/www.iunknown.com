                    <span>Mr. McCormack is as experienced as they come.<P>The book (like his others) is easy to read and full of gems.<P>However, He is much more capable in Sales and Management. Delightful book nonetheless.<P>I also recommend; You Can Negotiate Anything by Herb Cohen.</span>

                    <span>I already have read one of his older books what they don't teach you.... I liked that book and it's the same with 'on negotiating'. Mr. McCormack offers unique insights into the negotiating process though on a very personal and unuasal way. In order to get new ideas, to analyse a situation I am in as a negotiator I find his book really helpful. It's more much more interesting than the usual 'sales books' I've read before. And by the way I like to learn from the experiences of other people.</span>

                    <span>I enjoy reading Mark McCormack's books. On Negotiating was enjoyable, and provided some helpful things for me to think about and put into practice. However, if you were to buy only one book on the subject of negotiation, this would NOT be the first book to buy. Fisher, Ury and Patton's "Getting to Yes", or Cohen's "You can negotiate anything" are better books to begin with. Either of these books treat the reader more as a beginner and provide a more fundamental discussion than Mark McCormack's book.</span>

                    <span>I've just finished reading this book and I must say it is a must read for anyone in business who is in a position to do any buying or selling. Everything is a negotiation and this book offers great insights and many "common sense" things that you wouldn't think of when negotiating.<P>I fully recommend the book!</span>

                    <span>"Question everything" and "Think big,long term" is the premise of this audio cassette program. Does "Breakfast at Wimbledon" ring a bell? Mark McCormack was responsible for negotiating the deal behind the scenes, that would later become a household name and sunday afternoon event. As entrepreneur/owner of IMG(International Management Group)a sports marketing company, started with only $500.00 in capital, later to become a multi-million dollar corporation. Mark McCormack has the credibility and knows the power of negotiating. His teaching on this cassette program is invaluable to the listener, be it a lawyer or a layperson. McCormack is a dealmaker worth investing in.</span>
