                    <span>"Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours" by Jessie Liberty is an excellent tool for use in learning this difficult subject.<P>The author's program examples are clear and easily related to real-world programming applications. Program application themes he uses are carried throughout the book.<P>Example program code is line-numbered for reference in the follow-up explanatory text. Each example is followed by a representation of the output which would be yielded by execution of the program.<BR>This systematic approach is a tremendous aid to understanding. <P>Other books on this topic I have used contained an occasional typo in the sample code, which can be very confusing to a novice student.<BR>I didn't encounter any such problems in Mr. Liberty's book.<P>This book has been a very valuable aid to me.<BR>I look forward to other programming tutorials by this author.</span>

                    <span>The only experience I've had in programming, previous to reading this and one other C++ book, was a summer internship spent trying to learn Perl for a computational physicist. That said, I am a complete beginner to C++, and practically a beginner to all programming.<P>I found this book very easy to understand. The author does use a word or two per chapter that has not yet been introduced. However, understanding Libery's point never hinges on understanding a single term that hasn't been developed. Some chapters towards the middle of the book did move quickly and I had to re-read and work out the source code examples given more than once to understand them fully. I found most of the chapters to move a little slow for me though.<P>As should be understood from the title "in 24 Hours," this book is meant as an introduction. It should probably be read before taking a C++ programing course, or attempting more advanced C++ books. As another reviewer mention, this book lacks exercises. But, it does include numerous examples that should be typed out, compiled, and understood by the reader.<P>A great thing about this book is that it uses ANSI/ISO C++. That means that it works with all ANSI standard compilers, i.e. if you are using Linux, or a UNIX / FreeBSD based OS, you can use this book. It does come with it's own Windows compatible compiler/editor/debugger for you Winblows folks. I mentioned above that I bought two C++ books. One of them is not ANSI, and compiles poorly, if at all in Linux. Now that I'm learning what to look for, I've found a lot of books at the bookstore that do not use ANSI.<P>All-in-all, this is an excellent easy-to-understand introduction that should be used as just that.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a software type although I do have some background in programming. I wanted to learn C++ to build my own applications for my computer, but I wanted the learning curve to be reasonable so that I can do it on my spare time. I also wanted to learn programming C++ using my Visual C++ compiler. I purchased this book and Deitel's book "Introduction to MFC" which gets into using Microsoft Foundation Class. You can purchase both books from Amazon for under $45. The two books complemented each other perfectly, and in about 8 weeks spending about an hour each day, I can program applications using my compiler. These two books were perfect for a novice like myself. What was nice was that both books came with a working compiler and all the examples were available either as a download or was available on the CD-ROM. The book seems to give me all the command reference for ANSI and ISO C++ compiler which is a big plus if you also program for UNIX/LINUX systems. What these books doesn't do is that it won't teach you the more sophisticated operating system related things like how to access a disk or other I/Os. If you are trying to learn this level of programming, you need to move up to a higher level books such as the "Win32 System Programming: A Windows(R) 2000 Application Developer's Guide (2nd Edition)" by Johnson M. Hart. But to get started on C++ programming, after many false starts over the years, these two books did it for me.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I'm halfway through this book and am having serious doubts about the quality of its instruction. First of all, I am a professional programmer (C, PHP, PERL, Shell, some Java) and have a degree in technical writing, so I feel qualified to make some observations here.<P>First of all, the author breaks several rules of good technical writing, including using future tense, subjunctive mood, indefinite pronouns, and passive voice.<P>Second, the author's writing style is supposed to be conversational, but comes off as indirect and disorganized.<P>Third, the examples are poor, being completely inpractical, yet also verbose. (It's very difficult to follow a "simple" program across 4 or 5 pages.) The "analysis" section breaks the author's own rule by attempting to tell what a line of code does, rather than why. The author also frequently drops in statements that have not been explained yet, then passes over them in the analysis.<P>Fourth, there are frequent typos in this book. Often the typos are merely extra spaces (for example between two words in a variable name, like my Age, which makes me think of Perl 5's keyword "my" for modifying scope) but this is enough to confuse both the reader and a compiler. Perhaps these errors were introduced by the publishing application, but they clearly should have been caught by an editor.<P>Finally, there are no exercises in this book! The first rule of teaching a programming course (which I've done) is that people only retain information through practice. Where is the practice in this book???</span>
