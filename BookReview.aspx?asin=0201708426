                    <span>This book is part of a series with "Extreme Programming Explained" and "Planning Extreme Programming", and needs to be viewed in that context. "Extreme Programming Explained" is the manifesto, designed to get you fired up about the subject but thin on detail. "Extreme Programming Installed" covers some of the same ground, but focuses on real-world examples and advice on how to make Extreme Programming really work. <p>Jeffries and the team are not afraid to face up to things people have trouble with in real situations. The book covers dealing with difficult managers and customers, deciding what needs testing, making pair programming work for you, and lots more. The bulk of the book goes through the practices of Extreme Programming step by step, but some of the most useful stuff is contained in the so-called "bonus tracks" which appear at the end. The book also has a large and interesting annotated bibliography. Well worth reading, but I'd recommend that you start with "Extreme Programming Explained", then read this one if you like the idea, but want a more practical approach.</span>

                    <span>There's a certain amount of repetition in this book.  It makes me feel that perhaps each of the three authors took their assigned chapters and wrote them, much like they would take their assigned "story cards" at the beginning of a project.<br>But there's good practical advice here.<br>Take out a yellow highlighter and resolve: "OK, I'm going to highlight at least one good idea on every page".  You'll be able to do it.</span>

                    <span>I've read several of the original XP books (Explained & Planning) and to me this is the one that best explains XP and how to implement it.  This book was a revolution for me, and I haven't looked at software development in the same way since I read it.  It's hard to convert a company (especially managers) to XP, even at a new company on a new project.  Managers typically want developers to agree to schedules based on business goals.  XP will show you how to do this, but XP won't let you do the impossible.  There are tradeoffs, functionality for time.  Less time equals less functionality.  Sometimes managers just don't understand this (they want it all and they want it now).  In that case, it's best to find a new job!  But if you are able to apply the XP method, you will love your work, your customer and manager will be happy, and software development will be a pleasant and enjoyable experience.<p>A final note, I've read this book twice and several sections probably over a dozen times.  It can be a little skimpy on details and examples in a few places.  I've recently glanced through the new XP books and they give examples and fill in details, but they're expensive and you'd have to spend hundreds of dollars to buy them all and get all the details!  Instead look to the web.  There's an XP newsgroup (search for it with Google).  This book won't take you 100% but it will get you close enough to make it the rest of the way.  And of course if you can afford to buy XP Explained and Planning XP I think they're worth it.</span>

                    <span>This book, as well as "Extreme Programming Applied" by Ken Auer and Roy Miller are the two which should be read by a developer after the introductory "Extreme Programming Explained" by Kent Beck. XP Explained will encourage a reader to the new way of thinking, without bothering with technical details. For a manager it is OK, but for the developer, a bunch of questions will arise. "XP Applied" and "XP Installed" are to answer these questions, providing lots of tips, tricks and case studies.<p>The only disadvantage is that all the useful examples in these book contain code in SmallTalk, while C++ and Java are popular nowadays. SmallTalk has a distinct, unique style and may frighten C++ or Java developers. That's why I've rated the book four stars.<p>I would recommend this book to any XP'er.</span>
