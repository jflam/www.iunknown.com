<h3 class="title">Code Generation talk in Toronto</h3>

<p>If you live in and around Toronto, make sure that you drop by the <a href="http://www.dnugtor.com/Community/default.aspx">Toronto .NET User Group</a> meeting at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/canada/media/map_320_Matheson.mspx">Microsoft Canada</a> tonight. I'll be talking about my personal experiences with <a href="http://www.dnugtor.com/Community/UG+Events/122.aspx">code generation</a> tonight, and why I believe that this is the key software development <em>technique</em> that you must learn this year.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The meeting went extremely well. Nearly 100 people turned out to hear me talk about code generation. The questions from the audience during the talk were very insightful, and I'm really looking forward to hearing more stuff about code generation from my attendees. </p>

<p>As promised, here's a link to the <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/Files/gsl_tdnug_demos.zip"><span class="caps">GSL</span> scripts that I demonstrated during my talk.</a> Also, here's a link to my <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/Files/tdnug_code_generation_talk.ppt">PowerPoint slide deck.</a> </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h3 class="title">MT-Textile</h3>

<p>I'm really beginning to love Movable Type. My favorite feature in Movable Type is its plugin extensibility model. While in the middle of looking for more information about Movable Type tonight, I stumbled across Brad Choate's <em>most excellent</em> <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mttextile.php">MT-Textile</a> plug-in. This plug-in lets you have wiki-style formatting, which can greatly increase the speed with which you can type formatted text once you memorize its syntax. Highly recommended!</p>

<h3 class="title">Hello Movable Type!</h3>

<p><p>After more pain than I thought that I would go through, I finally finished converting my old <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/">CityDesk</a> site over to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>. The pain was largely due to two fairly major problems that I encountered along the way. <br />
<p>The first problem was due to the way that Movable Type wanted to maintain my entry archives. I used the individual entry archive option, which results in the generation of archive entries like "000001.html". However, I wanted to make sure that I didn't break any external links to my existing archive entries which had names like "http://www.iunknown.com/Archives/fog0000000030.html". To map between the two, I used an Apache .htaccess file to map the old URL's to the new URL's.<br />
<p>While I only have 257 entries in my weblog, I really didn't want to create my .htaccess file by hand. To solve this problem, I needed to write some code that would let me export the existing URL's for my archive entries from CityDesk. I wrote earlier about <a href="http://www.cantoni.org/2003/01/03.html#converting_from_citydesk_to_movable_type">Brian Cantoni's</a> excellent script for exporting entries. I had to modify Brian's script somewhat (for example, I export my entries by ascending date/time since I wanted my weblog entry to be "000001.html" and not "000257.html"). Also, I needed to generate XML in my export script since I would run over that script using a C# app that I wrote to solve nasty problem #2. Here's the CityDesk script that generates an export file called entries.xml:<br />
<p><pre><br />
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1252"?><br />
{$ setDateTimeFormat "English" "MM/dd/yyyy" "hh:mm:ss tt"$}<br />
<entries><br />
{$foreach x in (folder "Weblog") SortAscendBy .filedDate$} <br />
&lt;entry><br />
  author>John&lt;/author><br />
  &lt;title>&lt;![CDATA[{$x.headline$}]]>&lt;/title><br />
  &lt;date>{$x.fileddate$} {$x.filedtime$}&lt;/date><br />
  &lt;status>Publish&lt;/status><br />
  &lt;link>{$x.link$}&lt;/link><br />
  &lt;body>&lt;![CDATA[{$x.body$}]]>&lt;/body><br />
&lt;/entry><br />
{$ next $}<br />
&lt;/entries><br />
</pre><br />
<p>The second problem had to do with my comments. For my old site, all of my comments were managed by <a href="http://www.haloscan.com">Haloscan</a>, who for over a year provided me with comments on my web site. Unfortunately, they don't currently offer an export option to dump all of my existing comments out as an RSS file; I had to write some code to screen-scrape their existing site. Fortunately for me, <i>most</i> of their comment pages are valid XHTML, so I was able to do the requisite screen-scraping using XPath. Unfortunately, they don't correctly escape "&" and a few other characters so some of my comment pages didn't migrate automatically over. I still need to manually migrate those comments over to MT.<br />
<p>If you're interested in the code that I wrote to manage my migration, you can <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/Files/Class1.cs">download it here</a>.<br />
<p>One final note: I posted this entry using <a href="http://www.wbloggar.com">w.bloggar</a>, which is quite a nice offline editor. One thing that would really improve w.bloggar would be to use Microsoft's DHTML editing component as the editor within w.bloggar, much like what CityDesk does already.</p>

<h3 class="title">Exchange Server Full-text indexing rocks</h3>

<p>I always dreaded searching my email using Outlook. The search feature is so incredibly slow. While migrating my Exchange server to a beta of Exchange Server 2003 (I really wanted the new web outlook feature) I discovered the full-text indexing option. After enabling it, my searches through my 700MB mailbox are <EM>much </EM>faster; not instantaneous as I might have expected, but more than good enough for my purposes.</p>

<h3 class="title">Upgrading Windows 2000 Domain to Windows Server 2003</h3>

<p><P>A bit of preamble: my existing Windows 2000 domain controller's hard drive is about to die (thanks to the SMART diagnostics built into the drive). It also houses my Exchange server, so I needed to rebuild an Exchange server on another box and migrate my email over to that box. The other box happens to be a Windows 2003 Server box that I had built some time ago, and it is currently just loafing around as my Perforce source control server. So, while I was at it I decided to update my domain to be a Windows 2003 domain.</P><br />
<P>This was, ahem, a somewhat painful process. Here's a summary of the bold strokes for anyone else who might be going down this path:</P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI>Run adprep /forestprep on your existing domain controller box</LI><br />
<LI>Run adprep /domainprep on your existing domain controller box</LI><br />
<LI>Run dcpromo on the Windows 2003 server box that you want to turn into an active directory server</LI></UL><br />
<P>All went fine in this process until I ran dcpromo. I then proceeded to get a very obscure (and useless) error message, which went along the lines of: "... unable to convert the computer account ZZZ$ to a domain controller account. Access is denied".</P><br />
<P>Now <EM>that's </EM>a pretty useless error message. After spending some quality time with Google, I found only one question from an unfortuate Russian poster on a newsgroup.&nbsp;There were, of course, no replies.</P><br />
<P>I then spent several hours trying various permutations until I hit upon the solution.</P><br />
<UL><br />
<LI>I thought that it might be a group membership problem, but I was trying to do the operation using a known Enterprise Admin account which has all of the appropriate other group memberships. Still, I double checked them.</LI><br />
<LI>I eventually realized that it might be a privilege problem, so I ran the Security Policy editor. The only privilege that my administrator account didn't have enabled was the "Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation" privilege. So I enabled this privilege.</LI><br />
<LI>When I re-ran dcpromo, it STILL didn't work, even though I had the privilege enabled.</LI><br />
<LI>I then went back to the Computers and Users management console and manually enabled "Trust computer for delegation" for my Windows 2003 Server computer. Once I did this and reran dcpromo, everything worked just fine. </LI></UL><br />
<P>I hope this helps someone else who runs into this problem. I sooo hate administration.</P><br />
<P>&nbsp;</P></p>

<h3 class="title">Dynamic language angst</h3>

<p><P>I wonder if it's just me, or whether the community that I frequent has this on its collective consciousness, but I've been spending quite a bit of time wondering about the benefits of dynamically typed languages. </P><br />
<P><A href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1425.html">Sam Ruby</A> pointed me to <A href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</A>, which is a toolkit for building interfaces between C++ and various dynamically typed languages such as Python and Ruby.</P><br />
<P><A href="http://pinetree-tech.com/weblog/archives/2003/05/22/ruby_vs_python.shtml">Justin Rudd</A> is wondering which is better: Ruby or Python? And he also offers up some opinions of his own.</P><br />
<P><A href="http://www.neward.net/ted/weblog/index.jsp?date=20030522#1053617115876">Ted Neward</A> participated in a panel discussion at the Rocky Mountain Software Symposium with Dave Thomas of Pragmatic&nbsp;Programmer / Programming Ruby fame, and offers a good analysis of the difference between loose coupling, loose binding and loose typing.</P><br />
<P>Personally, I spent some time at the bookstore the other day looking over <A href="http://www.hetland.org/">Magnus Lie Hetland's</A> <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590590066/iunknowncom-20/">Practical Python</A> book. I really like the way the book is laid out, especially the way he offers up first and second implementations of the ten sample applications that he uses to round out his book.</P></p>

<p><P><A href="http://www.furrygoat.com/archives/000417.html">Steve Makofsky has a <EM>great</EM> idea</A> about how to use the inside covers of a book: for a book FAQ. This really does make it a lot easier for folks to figure out whether a book is worth buying at the bookstore if they could look at some questions that the book answers. </P><br />
<P>It's too bad that I don't actually do any <A href="http://www.furrygoat.com/Misc/Writing.html">Pocket PC Network Programming</A>, but I might just buy a copy to support Steve's idea.</P></p>

<h3 class="title">VS.NET Schema Editor</h3>

<p><P>I've been spending some time recently with the VS.NET XSD editor. Previously, I've generated data access layers from ad-hoc schema definitions in XML. I did this primarily to bootstrap the process and to partially to avoid the namespace issues in GSLgen. After my experience this afternoon, however, I'm on the verge of caving in and rewriting my code generation scripts to use the information in XSD schemas to [partially] generate the data access layers. </P><br />
<P>To be able to leverage XSD as-is would be awesome. Unfortunately, the current version (3.1) of GSLgen does not support namespaces. To further complicate matters, not only does it GSLgen not support namespaces, colons are reserved characters (identifiers in GSLgen cannot contain colons). This means that I cannot use xs:element as a valid element name in GSLgen. Grrrrrrr.</P><br />
<P>I might just run a sed/perl script over the XSD and convert all colons to underscores so that I can continue my work. But clearly, I would much prefer a world where GSLgen understood namespaces (and XPath too!).</P><br />
<P>While I'm busy complaining about my tools this afternoon (it really has been productive otherwise), I really wish the VS.NET folks would add an undo facility in the XSD editor. That and an auto-arrange that actually works would rock :)</P><br />
<P><STRONG>Update:</STRONG> After spending a bit of time thinking about how easy / hard it would be to leverage XSD, I've decided to back off on the idea. Instead, I'll just port the XSD into my own ad-hoc schema language. I really need to generate Pet Shop first and worry about tool issues later.</P></p>

<h3 class="title">Challenge-response email authentication</h3>

<p><P>I've been thinking about a challenge-response email authentication scheme for quite a while. The idea is simple: the first time that someone who isn't on your whitelist sends you an email, they receive an automated response that says "click on this link to actually send me the email". If you don't blacklist that sender, all subsequent emails get through.</P><br />
<P>Well, apparently a company called <A href="http://about.mailblocks.com/?src=loginhere">MailBlocks</A> has already done this. There are, however, two problems with their approach: 1) they don't integrate in with an existing enterprise-class email system and 2) they claim to hold the patent on the concept for which there is <A href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1107_2-1007581.html">apparently ample evidence of prior art</A>.</P><br />
<P>On a related note, my friend <A href="http://staff.develop.com/aarons/">Aaron Skonnard</A> has a similar setup on his voice line. If your number isn't on a recognized list of allowed callers or you are calling with caller id blocked, you will hear a recorded message that says "hit 1 if you are not a telemarketer". This has apparently blocked all unsolicited phone calls from his home, since it is illegal for a telemarketer to misrepresent themselves this way.</P></p>

<h3 class="title">.NET Pet Shop</h3>

<p><P>I just started looking at .NET Pet Shop today. My near-term goal is to reimplement .NET Pet Shop using code generation techniques. Given the hype that was given this application and its J2EE counterpart, the Java Pet Store, one would have expected to have found a reasonably well thought-out application. I think I expected too much.</P><br />
<P>The Pet Shop / Pet Store database schema is just plain awful. For a nice summary of what's broken in the database schema, <A href="http://www.deklarit.com/technical/DeKlarit_Pet_Shop_application_white_paper.pdf">see the excellent writeup from Deklarit</A> that describes their re-implementation of .NET Pet Shop using their code generation product. The first thing they had to do, however, was to fix the database schema. Most likely I'll start with their database schema; I just can't bear to take another look at the original schema!</P></p>

<h3 class="title">Moving to Movable Type</h3>

<p><P>Late last night, I finished doing an experimental [internal] port of my site over to Movable Type. I'd like to thank <A href="http://www.cantoni.org/">Brian Cantoni</A> <A href="http://www.cantoni.org/2003/01/03.html#converting_from_citydesk_to_movable_type">for his CityScript code frag</A> that helped to bootstrap the process. Watch out for the fact that the status is set to Draft and not Publish; had I actually <EM>read</EM> Brian's entry I would have realized this :)&nbsp;Mea culpa.</P><br />
<P>I've been very happy using CityDesk for the past year and a half. However, I'm at the stage where I really want the <A href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">TrackBack</A> and <A href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/stories/2003/01/0018.html">PingBack</A> features offered by a more mature (read: more than a big pile of static HTML and images) blogging infrastructure. A secondary goal is to regain control over my comments; I'd really like to see Google associate my comments with my URL.</P><br />
<P>There are two things that I still have to do:</P><br />
<OL><br />
<LI>Move my <A href="http://www.haloscan.com">Haloscan</A> comments over to Movable Type. I don't really see an easy way of pulling this one off. Suggestions would be welcome.<br />
<LI>Remap existing URL's to Movable Type's archive URL's. This is the higher priority of the two items since I don't want to break other external links to my site. Since the site is currently running on a friend's Free BSD box, I suspect I'll just have to write the .htaccess file that remaps the URL's. <A href="http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2003/03/09/changing_movable.php">This article</A> seems to have just enough information to help bootstrap that process.</LI></OL><br />
<P>Hopefully I can get most of the move done by the end of this week.</P><br />
<P>I spend about 50% of my time working on my laptop (which implies disconnected access at some random coffee shop in the Greater Toronto Area), so really need to have an offline blog editor. I took a quick peek at <A href="http://wbloggar.com/">w.bloggar</A> last night, and it looks quite promising.</P><br />
<P>&nbsp;</P></p>

<h3 class="title">Demos from my Pragmatic C# talk at VSConnections</h3>

<p>Here's <A href="Files/pragmatic.zip">a zip file</A> that contains the demos from the Pragmatic C# talk that I gave today at VS Connections. In this talk, I spoke about the world that lies beyond the edit-compile-debug cycle: unit testing, automated builds, and code generation. My one regret after giving this talk was the relatively short shrift that I gave on code generation. If you're going to be attending Win-Dev this June in Boston, make sure you drop by for the two-part talk that I'm giving on the same topic!</p>

<h3 class="title">Generation Gap: Another approach to delegation in code generation</h3>

<p><P>[Via Joel on Software] Folks that have been <A href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=42685&amp;ixReplies=28">discussing code generation over on the Joel on Software forums</A> pointed to a design pattern called <A href="http://www.research.ibm.com/designpatterns/pubs/gg.html#references">Generation Gap</A>, that was written up by John Vlissides that never made it into <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/iunknowncom-20/002-2271051-7712863">Design Patterns</A>. </P><br />
<P>I don't use subclassing to do delegation; instead I call a static method on another class. For example:</P><CODE><br />
<P>public void MyGeneratedMethod( int arg1, float arg2, Stream arg3 )<BR>{<BR>&nbsp; MyDelegatedClass.MyDelegatedMethod( this, arg1, arg2, arg3 );<BR>}</P></CODE><br />
<P>I believe that my approach is more flexible in that I can delegate at any point in a class hierarchy, not just at the leaf nodes. The downside is that this can sometimes break encapsulation in systems that don't support the notion of internal visibility. </P></p>

<h3 class="title">YARR Yet Another RSS Reader</h3>

<p><P>While preparing for our one day pre-conference tutorial at VS Connections, I decided to build YARR (Yet Another RSS Reader) as a sample application. I felt it was a particularly interesting sample application since it represented the intersection of four different technology spheres: XML, [D]HTML, SQL, and C#.</P><br />
<P>I presented it to our students in the class in about an hour or so. I also presented it as an application that is ripe for code generation since I feel that code generation lets you efficiently <A href="Weblog/Cross-technologyabstracti.html">capture cross-technology abstractions</A>. I'm placing a drop of the <A href="Files/yarr.zip">source code for YARR here</A>, for anyone who may be interested in taking a look.</P><br />
<P>To install / setup the code, you need to run the SQL script from solution\sql in the ZIP file. I have a nice little command-line batch file that will run the osql command line utility from you. Just modify the script to point to your SQL server, and optionally change the login that you want to use to create the database schema. The only other bit of tweaking you might want to do is to copy the included default.htm file to the c:\temp directory (or modify the sources to read the default HTML page that is displayed in IE from somewhere else).</P><br />
<P>Comments / feedback would be welcome. Next up tomorrow is to rewrite this sample app using code generation.</P></p>

<h3 class="title">GSLgen, context and loops</h3>

<p><P>In the <A href="Weblog/CodegenerationwithGSLgenS.html">first article in this series</A>, I talked about the basics of acquiring, compiling and running GSLgen. In this article, I'll introduce GSLgen's notion of context, and how it can be used within loops.</P><br />
<P>Let's consider how we can use GSLgen to generate some C# classes. Here's an XML file that contains the simplest possible definition of two classes:</P><CODE><br />
<P>&lt;classes&gt;<BR>&nbsp; &lt;class name="Person"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp; &lt;class name="Place"/&gt;<BR>&lt;/classes&gt;</P></CODE><br />
<P>Here's a GSL script that iterates over the XML file:</P><CODE><br />
<P>using System;<BR>.for classes.class</P><br />
<P>public class $(name)<BR>{<BR>}<BR>.endfor</P></CODE><br />
<P>And this is what it generates:</P><CODE><br />
<P>using System;<BR><BR>public class Person<BR>{<BR>}</P><br />
<P>public class Place<BR>{<BR>}</P></CODE><br />
<P>Let's take a closer look at the GSL script. It showcases the&nbsp;for ... endfor construct which is commonly used to iterate over a set of XML elements. The for statement's expression, <CODE>classes.class</CODE>, defines what XML elements to iterate over. Within the body of the for ... endfor statement is a template. That template's context changes each time through the loop to point to the current XML element. The $(name) expression retrieves the value of the name attribute of the current XML node and outputs the value to the output stream.</P><br />
<P>Next, let's consider a more complex XML file that contains some nested elements that we want to iterate over:</P><CODE><br />
<P>&lt;classes&gt;<BR>&nbsp; &lt;class name="Person"&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;field name="Name" type="string"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;field name="Age" type="int"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp; &lt;/class&gt;<BR>&nbsp; &lt;class name="Place"&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;field name="Address" type="string"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;field name="Zip" type="string"/&gt;<BR>&nbsp; &lt;/class&gt;<BR>&lt;/classes&gt;</P></CODE><br />
<P>We can nest our for ... endfor loops like so:</P><CODE><br />
<P>using System;<BR>.for classes.class</P><br />
<P>public class $(name)<BR>{<BR>.for field<BR>&nbsp; private $(type) $(name)_;<BR>.endfor<BR>}<BR>.endfor</P></CODE><br />
<P>Which results in the generation of the following C# code:</P><CODE><br />
<P>using System;</P><br />
<P>public class Person<BR>{<BR>&nbsp; private string Name_;<BR>&nbsp; private int Age_;<BR>}</P><br />
<P>public class Place<BR>{<BR>&nbsp; private string Address_;<BR>&nbsp; private string Zip_;<BR>}</P></CODE><br />
<P>As you can see, the nested for ... endfor loop inherits the context of its parent for ... endfor loop. This lets us write very simple code that can iterate over nested elements using a very natural syntax.</P></p>
