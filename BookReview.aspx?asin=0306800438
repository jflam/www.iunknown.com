                    <span>This book is excellent all around, giving good background on John Coltrane's life, discussions of many of his albums, quotes from people who either played with Coltrane or were otherwise part of his life. There's a good discography, although so much new material has been issued since the book has come out, it's become rather patchy and dated. Thomas is a good writer (terrific for a music writer) but sometimes gets way off on tangents. That's my only criticism. But you get a good sense of the man, his music, his influence on other musicians, and his place in history. You can't ask for much more than that in a rock bio.</span>

                    <span>Think of this as the cliff notes edition of the life of John Coltrane. An alternate title could be "I Remember Trane." The book moves quickly over the first part of his life and concentrates mostly on his recording years. The early struggling years that were characterized by drugs is glossed over and pretty much picks up in ernest with his quiting in 1957. The best parts of this easy to read book are the lines attributed to his friends or those that knew him.  The insights are clearly evident throughout the book as it is filled with little known tid bits as shared by people who crossed paths with the man. It seems everyone had an opinion or crossed paths with Trane. There are studio recollections, club dates, both on and off stage memories, diary excerpts but most of all reflections on the part of fellow musicians. Some of the encounters are remarkeable, like the time Gato Barbieri, the Argentine saxophonist, met him backstage in Europe and saw the sax case he had sent Coltrane. Coltrane exclaimed "you're from Argentina" and was unaware that Gato was the man who had sent the monographed leather case. The personal recollections make this a memorable book and a quick reference point for further and more detailed reading. The pictures are minimal but historically worthy. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in Coltrane and would like to get some quick and easy insights into the legendary sax great. This is Coltrane 1A, there is ample room for further knowledge, beginning with his music.</span>

                    <span>This biography of John Coltrane is the best book ever written about someone. This book gives you information about his childhood, his teen years, his life on the road when he was performing with various bands, and this book gives you 2-20 line paragraphs written by John's friends or people who new him very well. This book is a must if you are a musician and wondering about jazz history, or if you are a Coltrane fan. Buy it today.</span>

                    <span>I don't regret reading "Chasin' The Trane," but the writing is swooning, simplistic, and extremely dated. Parts of it read like a mediocre high school essay."Chasin' The Trane" is somewhat redeemed by the large number of quotes from peers, fans, critics, and family. J.C. Thomas  deserves credit for interviewing a large number of people and tracking down  decent secondary sources. The book really opens up when the people who knew  Coltrane are allowed to speak in their own voices. Overall, however, the  writing is poor. I read "Chasin' The Trane" and a Dizzy Gillespie  biography called "Groovin' High" (recommended) back to back; the  difference in quality and lasting literary merit was huge.</span>

                    <span>This book is easy to read and contains a lot of information but seems a little dated.  It clearly illustrates that it was published in the '70s as it includes details of Mr. Coltrane's astrological chart and way over the  top comparisions (like John Coltrane and Albert Einstein).  This book is  also not for cynics - I found myself rolling my eyes more than once at the  overly flowery content.  I did like that the book spoke of his personal  problems in relation to the albums released and how the changes in his life  affected his study of music.  The best parts of the book are the short  quotes from his family and friends.</span>
