                    <span>If my cape was on the ocean this would be a good source of ideas. However, it offers little for the typical solid, somewhat plain capes that populate middle America. I love mine and could use some practical advice - this book doesn't help much.</span>

                    <span>My husband and i just recently purchase a Cape house and were use to living in less traditional houses....This book gives us so many inspirations on how to make our new house more us! We took it out of the library before we moved in and.....haven't returned it yet! I think it's time to get one of our own! We took out 50+ books but this one was just what we wanted to see sooooo many ideas! Not frumpy - clean lines, open spaces, etc...</span>

                    <span>If the number of reviews seems scant, it's probably because readers of this book are inspired to head for their drawing boards or take sledgehammer to wall, rather than compose a book review. Who has time to write a paragraph or two for Amazon when there are contractors to call and design decisions to make? This book will motivate you Cape owners out there to finally make the updates that you've been thinking about since you moved in -- whether it's just replacing rusty bathroom cabinets or adding that extra bedroom so your two boys don't have to share a room anymore.</span>

                    <span>Jane Gitlin's book is a pleasure to read -- again and again. My wife and I own a classic Cape. We've spent the past 10 years renovating it, bit by bit. Now we're contemplating a major exterior remodeling project and Jane's book is a treasure trove of excellent ideas. The text and photos offer many creative alternatives to the standard, time-worn designs suggested by many architects and contractors. The book truly renewed our sense of pride in owning a classic Cape. Bravo!</span>

                    <span>I showed this book to a contractor friend who immediately went out and bought one for his own use. Lots of new ideas, with great illustrations and photos to refer to when discussing options for one's own project. Highly recommended.</span>
