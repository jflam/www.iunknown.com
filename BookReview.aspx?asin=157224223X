                    <span>I am very familiar with the pain of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia for I suffered from these maladies for several decades. During those years of suffering I believed that my problems were purely mental and underwent treatment by psychiatrists, psychologists, and hypnotherapists. I took various prescribed medications and read many books such as this, but experienced little relief. And then something wonderful happened: I began taking a daily supplement of chelated magnesium (for a different ailment) and shortly thereafter experienced a significant diminishment of anxiety in addition to cure of the ailment for which I had originally taken the supplemental magnesium. There seemed to be no explanation for why taking supplemental magnesium caused this wonderful loss of anxiety until the publication in 2003 of the important book The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean. Early in her book Dr. Dean reveals that a major cause of anxiety and panic attacks is deficiency of magnesium and that magnesium deficiency is quite common in the U.S. Therefore, I beg all sufferers of anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia -- whatever else you may do -- please purchase and read The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Carolyn Dean and please try the magnesium supplementation which she recommends. It may change your life as has changed mine.</span>

                    <span>This is a fantastic book, very comprehensive and hands-on. I would also recommend learning the energy management technique taught by SelfTherapy.org for very quick relief if you're currently suffering from anxiety, and then use this book to fill in the gaps. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>This book really helped me work out some issues on my panic attacks. It helps by providing insight from the first page. It is a definite must read that helps those of us suffering from panic move back into a more normal life. I also would recommend "What if...? My Story of Panic Attacks" which I though was resourceful as well. </span>

                    <span>This book was an enormous help to me. Knowing why we do what we do definately helps. I have highlighted marks all through my book and carried it with me like a Bible. If you suffer from panic attacks, seperation anxiety, GAD, depression, PTSD, OCD, seasonal affect disorder or agoraphobia this book can change your life!</span>
