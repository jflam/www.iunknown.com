                    <span>This book is an indispensible resource for writers, students, editors, journalists, businesspeople -- anybody who needs to write proposals, papers, stories, you name it. Clearly organized in dictionary form, this book contains the answers to those key and nagging questions. Is the "m" in "English muffin" supposed to be capitalized? When do you hyphenate "right-wing"? How exactly do you properly use "lay and lie"? What's the appropriate abbreviation for an army corporal? And does a speaker stand behind or on a podium? Finally figure out which preposition is precisely correct.<P>In addition to common style questions like the ones above, the stylebook contains a wealth of common information. What is a mach number? How does one calculate heat indexes and wind chill factors? And other pieces of commonly needed information are interspersed throughout the text.<P>This edition also includes specific guides for business and sports terminology, as well as an Internet guide.<P>While less useful to those not members of the media, this text also includes a briefing on media law. Some sections, such as the right to individual privacy, might appeal to the general public.<P>The AP Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law is an essential addition to any reference collection.</span>

                    <span><P>While the media run rampant with flimsy leads and stories based solely on hearsay, it's good to know that at least their grammar stays in check, thanks to the hard and fast rules set forth in the Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual.<P>Providing direct distinctions between similar words, the correct spelling of commonly-misspelled words, and the politically-correct use of dangerous words, the AP stylebook delineates specific style rules for virtually every journalistic possibility. Set up in a dictionary-style format, the manual's general stylebook lists everything from the perils of "a" versus "an" to the preferred usage of ZIP codes.<P>Following the stylebook are the more specific sections dealing with sports and business style, both also set up with A to Z listings, including usage and spelling. Although sports writing info may be confined to the needs of the sportswriter, the business section is helpful for those who take interest in corporate designations and definitions of stock market terms.<P>Finally, just before the manual switches from the absoluteness of style to the murky legal waters of the libel section, comes, in my opinion, the pièce de résistance-A Guide To Punctuation-music to the ears of syntax-psychos and grammar-Nazis, alike.<P>Starting with words of wisdom from what the AP refers to as "a bible of writers," "The Elements of Style," this portion is eleven pages of invaluable knowledge for any writer, regardless of profession, and is arranged so succintly that even children can access its information for their own use.<P>Although I have thus far had little use for the information about libel in this book, it is primarily what its introduction claims-not a libel text, but merely a useful guide which "explains the fundamental principles in libel for working writers and editors." It also contains some key parts of the Freedom of Information Act which should be read by everyone to fully know our rights regarding the access to federal information, during what has now become the Age of the X-file.<P>All-in-all, the AP Stylebook and Libel Manual should be a welcome edition to any writer's reference library.</span>

                    <span>I agree with most reviewers, that this is a usefull book, but just because it serves a purpose, doesn't mean one should think uncriticaly of it. The most important thing is that this is a resource for both journalists and students, and because it is so essential, it is imparative that we address some problems with this book: Namely that the world has changed and the AP Stylebook has not kept up. <P>By nature, this book is essential. It fills a very real need. It supplies an essential and uniform standard for the composition of news writting. For this function, the book deserves five stars, however because this function is so essential, it requiers an up to date standard, and untill this book comes up to pace with the modern times, I will withold three of those stars.<P>When I say it is not up to date, a great example of what I mean comes with the current frequency of the need to use Arabic names. The book provides no clear standard for this. The Arabic name Al Queda, for instance, has become quite common place, but news organizations have struggled with how exactly to quote this name. Most of the trouble centers around the singular nomonative case article ('al') which of course translates as 'the.' Thus, Al Queda has also been cited as The Queda, or even just Queda. If the whole invaluable point of the book is standardize the language used in reporting, then it needs to address the newest issues in the news and the vocabulary that has rocketed into our headlines from out of nowhere in the last few years.<P>Also, as bad as what is left out may be, it is not nearly as bad as what is left in. For instance, the book suggest that the proper way to refer to Mainland China is "Red China." Even worse, the book explains that the uncapitalized term 'god' is used to refer to *false* gods, whereas the capitalized term 'God' is used to refer to the *one true god.* For me this is particularly offensive, and on the whole, these are just a couple of the examples of the sort of antiquated and obnoxious McCarthy-era media manipulations that for some reason still haunt us through the AP Style Manual.<P>In the end, these problems are all easy to fix, and this book comes out in new editions all the time. I believe it performs an essential function, of standardizing the terms used by the media, which should reduce biased manipulation of language (as opposed to encouraging them, as in the examples I have given). I worked journalism in College, and I even won a few awards. I credit much of this to the ideas and applications behind the AP Style manual. Not only does it do a great service to journalism and reporting, but also, it teaches an elegant and simple way of writting, succinctly and to the point without sacraficing depth and sophistication.<P>I was once told by a gifted Classicist, after reading both Herodotus and Thucidides, that although it would be easy to lapse into writting like Herodotus, one really should strive to write like Thucidides. The best way I can explain Thucidides' style in modern terms is to equate that aspiration with reading and observing the concepts in the Associate Press Stylebook.</span>

                    <span>also Media Relations Handbook for Agencies, Associations, Nonprofits and Congress. The Handbook is written by Brad Fitch, who worked in Washington PR for more than a decade, with a Foreword by Mike McCurry.<P>What others have said about Fitch's book (about which you can see more at MediaRelationsHandbook.com ):<P>"Great advice for beginners and experienced media hands. If you are a media relations professional--either beginner or seasoned veteran--this is the book for you. Brad Fitch, who spent many years fielding reporters' tough questions on Capitol Hill, has written a timely, practical guide to handling media relations that is filled with solid professional advice. What goes into a press release? How do you develop a strategic message? You've got a digital camera and a fax machine, but what else does your office need to effectively handle the media? Before you start talking to a reporter, do you know the difference between 'on the record,' 'off the record,' and 'background'? When there's an immediate crisis in your organization, what are the eight mistakes that you absolutely must avoid? How do you handle your paranoid boss when he or she has to confront the press? You'll find the answers to these and many other everyday problems in this book. Fitch also gives valuable advice on how to set up an effective website and how to use e-mail for optimum communications. Excellent book for professionals who work in federal or state agencies, trade associations, non-profits, state legislatures or Congress. It's the only handbook you'll ever need." <BR>Dennis W. Johnson, college professor and former Capitol Hill senior staffer<P>"Provides valuable advice for those who flack for a living."<BR>Roll Call<P>"A superb blend of theory and practice, written by someone who uses words like Gallup uses polls."<BR>Steve O'Keefe, author "Complete Guide to Internet Publicity" and Adjunct Faculty, Tulane University College<P>"Uncertain how to interest the press in your pressing issue? Having difficulty preparing your media-unfriendly boss for a tough interview? Worried about the next communications crisis and how to handle it? Brad Fitch answers those questions and many more in this crisp, clear and completely useful book."<BR>Tucker Carlson, Co-Host CNN Crossfire, author<P>"A seminar from TheCapitol.Net is one of the best ways to learn from the experts about how Washington really works. Now all that insight and information has been packed into this invaluable volume. I suggest you read it, and become your own expert."<BR>Steven V. Roberts, syndicated columnist, TV and radio analyst, college professor<P>"Brad Fitch has performed an admirable public service by giving public relations students and professionals alike an indispensable tool. His book provides a road map on both the practicalities and principles of PR, and he shows that honest PR is not an oxymoron. Now it's up to all of us in the media and spin industries to keep our end of the bargain."<BR>Ed Henry, Congressional Correspondent, CNN (formerly Senior Editor of Roll Call)<P>"This volume is an invaluable road map to the mean streets of a city where information is power and power is everything. Brad Fitch has written a rich 'how-to' lesson for pros and for novices who must negotiate the competitive landscape of America's new media."<BR>Ann Compton, White House Correspondent, ABC News<P>"Media Relations Handbook is to political campaigns what The Art of War is to military campaigns: an essential strategic reference that winners should never be without." <BR>James Carville, Co-Host CNN Crossfire, author<P>Again, you can see more about Fitch's book at MediaRelationsHandbook.com or search Amazon using the ISBN: 1587330032</span>

                    <span>A guide to usage, this is a manual of style for words and subjects commonly encountered in news writing, designed to help writers make correct choices and instruct users about media law. The bulk of the work is "The Stylebook," an alphabetical list of the Associated Press's rules on grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, abbreviations, and usage; for example, "Hispanic" is the "preferred term for those whose ethnic origin is in a Spanish-speaking country," and "Chicano" should be avoided as a synonym for Mexican American. The stylebook offers information on such thorny matters as military titles, titles of nobility, and metric and temperature conversions. Special sections include an Internet guide with terms for sports and business guidelines and style and a briefing on media law, explaining such things as libel law, fair reporting, the right of privacy, and media applications related to the First Amendment. The work's audience clearly includes journalists and anyone who writes for the news media, as well as students at all levels, particularly those interested in journalism.</span>
