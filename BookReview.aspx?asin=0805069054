                    <span>As were many of the leading figures of the American Revolutionary period, James Madison was a Virginia aristocrat drawn to public service, but with a special interest in the structure of government. Madison was small in stature, somewhat sickly, and not particularly socially adept. He preferred to make his influence felt by operating in the background of legislative halls. His inability to judge and lead men was part of the reason that his presidency reeked of ineptitude.
<br />
<br />The author shows Madison at his intellectual best in his advocacy of the separation of church and state and his profound work in orchestrating the Constitutional Convention and the construction of the document. But it is rather evident that Madison exhibited ideological tendencies in addition to his studied rationality. He shifted rather dramatically from extolling a strong central state with the ability to veto state legislation to the republican position of Jefferson in the span of a few years. While president his Anti-Federalist and anti-British biases constantly led him down the wrong path. His convoluted dealings with Britain and France, his fascination with embargos, and his inability to select competent Cabinet officers and emissaries led unnecessarily to the War of 1812. His policies regarding the raising of an army, the selection of generals, the use of naval power, the financing of the war effort, and an obsession with invading Canada could have easily led to Britain defeating the US. 
<br />
<br />Despite the obvious shortcomings of Madison's presidency, the author is inclined to rate Madison rather highly as a leading figure of the Revolution. But there are chinks in that belief. The document that Madison receives most credit for has had problems. The Constitution in many ways rolled back the republicanism of the Revolution. It's potential for maintaining gridlock is unmistakable. The ability of elites of one persuasion or the other to dominate government has been evident since 1789. 
<br />
<br />The book is brief. There is no coverage of the lead up to Madison being elected president in 1808. One wonders why he even took that step. He was not the right man for the job. Perhaps the brevity of the book does not give a sufficiently balanced presentation to appreciate Madison. Many readers will wonder how we survived Madison's presidency. It makes one think of the current presidency in terms of its choices of personnel, policies, agendas, and ideological tendencies.

                    <span>To me, the "American Presidents" series is one of the more unusual ongoing publication projects.  Endeavoring to provide accounts of the people who have occupied the presidency and their terms in office, they have selected a first-class group of writers and historians (such as Sean Wilentz, William Leuchtenburg, and Douglas Brinkley) but often paired them up with subjects a little outside their normal focus - having Robert Remini, the foremost biographer of Andrew Jackson, write on John Quincy Adams instead, for example.<p>This volume is no different.  Garry Wills is one of my favorite writers, the author of many thought-provoking books on subjects as diverse as Saint Augustine, the Gettysburg Address, and John Wayne.  While he has written on the era before - his book on the Declaration of Independence is one of the best studies of it available - he has not previously focused on Madison in his publications.  Nevertheless, this book is a good introduction to the man.  While ostensibly focused on the presidency, Wills does incorporate much about Madison's pre-presidential career, especially in terms of how it shaped a presidency that by common consensus most historians regard as disappointing compared to his pervious accomplishments.<p>What makes this volume interesting to read, though, is Wills' own analysis.  He never shies away from outlining his opinion, and he backs it up with persuasive (though not always convincing) arguments.  His examination of Madison's foreign policy in the context of the Jeffersonian tradition is particularly good and alone worth the effort of reading the book.  Though there are better books to turn to for a more comprehensive overview of Madison's career (such as Ralph Ketcham's biography), this is an excellent starting point in seeking to understand one of the most important of our Founding Fathers.</span>

                    <span>Garry Wills has done a solid job with this entry in the American Presidents series. He focuses on one simple question: Why was Madison not a great president? Wills, after detailing Madison's pre-presidential achievements, examines his two terms in office with an eye toward certain types of mistakes that Madison made again and again. His research is outstanding; his writing solid.</span>

                    <span>Garry Willis provides a short, but concise summary of the administration of James Madison.  He gives an overview of problems that plagued James Madison as president.  Even though Madison was extremely effective at the several Constitutional conventions he attended and was an excellent legislator, being the executive proved to be a more difficult task than Madison could effectively handle.<p>The one shortcoming, was that at the end of book Willis notes that the Madison presidency experienced a surge in popularity without really delving into the reasons as to why this occured.  This surge according to Willis prevents historians from rating Madison a failed president or for that matter an average president.  There are some implications as to why this occured, but a more direct address of the issue would have been beneficial.  All in all, however, Willis' accounting of the Madison presidency is a good overview into the administration of this president.</span>

                    <span>The first two or three chapters of this book were tough-going.  The writing was choppy because the author kept jumping from his own narrative to lengthy quotes from Madison.  But persistence paid off.  It may not be the definitive biography of James Madison, but it's a good read.<p>The book is short and focuses on Madison's presidency, with some background on his accomplishments before becoming president. The story that Garry Wills tells is that James Madison enjoyed a moderately successful presidency in spite of himself.  While he was a brilliant and effective member of the legislature, he really didn't have what it takes to be a good president.  He was too much of an ideologue and not enough of a pragmatic.  One of his big mistakes was the embargo.  Both before and during his presidency he believed England was more reliant on trade with the U.S. that the the other way around.<p>The passages about early naval battles in the War of 1812 were fun: the fledgling United States whipping the most powerful navy in the world.  Of course, Madison thought the war could easily be won on land and didn't even think we should have a navy.  Nor did he think we should have a federal bank, until he ran out of money to carry on the war.  The idea that he was ruining the U.S. economy with his embargo probably never occurred to him.<p>But the book has a happy ending. The War of 1812 ended without destroying the U.S.  Additionally, during Madison's presidency the extreme polarization between the Federalists and the Republicans was tempered quite a bit-more people recognized the need for a stronger federal government.  All in all, the United States of America was in a better place at the end of Madison's 8 years as president.</span>
