                    <span>Not sure why my previous review of this book was erased from Amazon, but it was probably whining on the author or publisher's part because of a poor rating.<P>This book (besides being biased against Mac users) is not the best for new Illustrator users because it doesn't create the best foundation for future learning. Being an advanced user myself, I wanted to buy something for a friend who wants to learn Illustrator, and I thought the Dummy series would be a good place to start. Several lessons instruct users to perform tasks in a way that real world users rarely use (because of inefficiency, better method, etc.).<P>The Visual Quick Start series or the Classroom in a Book series on Illustrator are far superior to this. (The CIB in a book is really the best--partly because it was written by the pros at Adobe).</span>

                    <span>Content of book is good. The author demystifies the technical aspects of Illustrator fairly well.<P>But the book's organization is below par. The author is verbose at times, and some of his cliches tend to clutter the chapters. For future editions, the author needs to address the fundamental concepts more concisely. Extra visual aids would also prove helpful.</span>

                    <span>This book is a great place to start learning. The information is accurate, well written and excellent. Alspach uses humor to make the learning of Illustrator a little less intimidating. The illustrations are well done and explain the theory well. The book is full of tips that will make the reader more productive and efficient with the application. Maybe not for intermediate or advanced users but a great starter book for Mac and Windows users.</span>

                    <span>The author of this book has a personal bias against Mac's. Don't feed his ego by buying this book!<P>Here's the quote FROM THIS BOOK: "As of 2003, Windows systems have taken a decisive lead over Macs when it comes to performance," Alspach writes in his book. "The difference is most apparent with graphics applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator, but you'll notice it with other applications as well. If you're thinking of purchasing a new system, and speed and responsiveness is important (or at least more important than the feel of the OS, I suggest getting a zippy PC over a (comparably) sluggish Mac."<P>Considering the G5 desktop, his statement is misinformed. I have no idea how his comment against Mac's is relevant to the book, yet it's in there.</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately Ted decided that this book about Illustrator would be a good place to share his platform preference (he recommends PCs over Macs). The only problem with his advice is that it is based purely on computer performance, and there is alot more to consider when choosing a platform. For example, Ted's advice also steers his readers towards endless virus headaches, privacy and security problems, and years of unexpected costs just to keep your "higher performing" computer up and running.</span>
