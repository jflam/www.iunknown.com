                <span id="Label1"><P>In "the best book to date on the subject" (<I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>), prize-winning journalist David A. Kaplan brings to life the culture and history of Silicon Valley. The symbol of high-tech genius and ineffable wealth, a place that competes with Hollywood and Washington in the zeitgeist of success and excess, the Valley is the epicenter of the New Economy. Depending on yesterday's stock market close, roughly a quartermillion Siliconillionaires live in the Valley. And they're building megalo-mansions and buying Lamborghinis as fast as they can. Combining reportorial insight and biting wit, <I>The Silicon Boys</I> tells the unforgettable story of dreams and greed, ambition and luck, that has become the <B>Valley of the Dollars.</B></P></span>

                    <span>"The Silicon Boys and Their Valley of Dreams" is a well written description of Silicon Valley at it's peak. It describes the culture of the valley during the nineties. It is an interesting peek into the a world of driven software developers and venture capitalists and everyone else in their galaxies. It focuses on companies and names we've all heard of: Apple, Oracle, Netscape, Microsoft, Intel, and many more. For anyone in the technology industry, this book is a good window onto the 90s - pre dotcom mania.</span>

                    <span>This was one of the best Silly Valley stories I've read yet. Kaplan does a very good job offering a historical and chronological storyline that educates the reader while holding interest. Hence an educational book that also happens to be very unique and authentic.</span>

                    <span>The non-fiction book The Silicon Boys and Their Valley of Dreams is written by David A. Kaplan. It is about how Silicon Valley started and why it is important to be near all the silicon in California. Also it explains who invented and invents the processors and software. It talks about Intel, then Apple and Microsoft, after that Oracle, then Kleiner Perkins, Mozilla, Microsoft, and finally Yahoo.<p>	David A. Kaplan used many correct facts and you can see who his sources are in the back of the book. It is organized chronologically starting at the early `70s when "The Traitorous Eight" first started developing processors. It concludes in 1999 when Microsoft was developing Internet Explorer and Yahoo was popular. Each chapter talks about a company or person or both.<p>	I think it was a very good book. It told me a lot about the computer industry and the people behind it. If you don't care much about computers you shouldn't read this book but if you even have a slight interest, you'd like this book. The author did a very good job explaning the aspects of the computer industry, so even if you don't know much about computers you can understand this book.</span>

                    <span>Great read on the culture of the Silicon Valley and how tycoons like Jobs, Yang, Ellison, Andreesen, and Clark built their companies.

                    <span>Considering what influence Silicon Valley has had on the U.S. and the world's economy, it is amazing how few know the history behind its growth and those who contributed. Mr. Kaplan's book attempts to methodically parses through the Valley's roots and its bloom, and he does so with quite a bit of editorial bite.<p>Mr. Kaplan's prose is easy to follow as well as quite generous with its descriptions of technological feats, making the book enjoyable for the layman who may not understand the technology to the engineer who may like to read an overview of the technology and how they all developed and relied on each other.<p>I gave the book 4 stars as opposed to 5 because even though Mr. Kaplan's editorial take on some events were quite amusing, the bias ostracizes his attempt to clearly follow the Valley's growth, and instead, throws increasingly more doubt towards his ability to accurately comprehend the true importance and implications from such events. <p>This book is a good reference for how things developed in the Valley, but it is from an outsider's view with respect to the contributions of a few public characters dominating the media versus the drive and ambition of all the engineers who developed the technology itself.</span>
