                    <span>This large coffee table style book is essentially a visual record of the last Russian Tsar and his family. It features page after page of large photos - the famous black and white family album shots, many not-so-famous pictures of the family at home and their friend and relatives. These are interspersed with colour photographs of relevant locations (e.g. Alexander Palace, site of the former Impatiev House), which are absolutely stunning purely from a visual point of view. Photos of personal objects that belonged to the family - jewelery, letters and toys are also included. <P>Along with the photos, there is an accompanying text that tells the basic story. It covers the Romanov saga right from Nicholas and Alexandra's childhoods, to their marriage, children, Rasputin, the revolution and the modern day sequel to their story. It is not an academic work, and the information is broad and somewhat lacking in detail. For information on the last Tsar, there are numerous biographies which would serve the inquiring reader better.<P>But as I said, this is a coffee table book for the lay person.<BR>It is like the "creme caramel" of the Romanov library. Rich, indulgent, a must have, but definately not the main course.</span>

                    <span>This book is by far one of the best Romanov books out there. It's a rather big book and it is filled with wonderful photographs of the family. There are also many photos of the grand palaces in which the family lived their lives. The text is also very good on certain levels. Peter Kurth tells the story of the last Russian Imperial family with great detail right up to the very end. This is a must read and no Romanov library is complete without it.</span>

                    <span>I will say that that Kurth's book about the last imperial family is rather extrodinary and interesting. The photos that he included in the book were outstanding, they displayed a quite vivid insight into the tsar's family life and the world in which they lived. I finally sat down and read through the book one day and was quite disturbed by the way in which he displayed the family. He took away that feeling of innocence and love the family had. To rap it all up he included that fraud Anna Anderson in the final chapter of his book. She was not the grand duchesse and should not have been included. Overall the book was good and I would recommend it to anybody that wants not only to learn about the family but also the world in which they lived.</span>

                    <span>This is a great book if you like history and the personal pictures that go with history. The story of this family is so tragic and this book covers both the personal and public lives of the last Tsar of Russia. I found it very interesting with pictures that are from the families own personal albums plus newer picturs taken in present day. This is a great book if you are interested in this part of history. Beautifully put together it will make a great addition to any personal library.</span>
