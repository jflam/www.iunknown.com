                    <span>Leuchtenburg's book is an excellent work that shows in depth the various aspects of life in the 1920's.  Whether you are interested in the pop culture, politics, or economics of the time, this book has it all.  A very interesting and easy read.  Recommended for people who want to learn about the 1920's and life in America during that time.</span>

                    <span>THE PERILS OF PROSPERITY 1914-1932 is a history book that gives readers a brief glimpse into American life during 1914-1932. The book is not meant to be a detailed account, but is rather an overview of events and attitudes of the United States at that time. I found the book to be easy to read, quite interesting, and full of information I had never come across before. Major events that the book discusses include the U.S. involvement in WWI, the U.S. decision not to become a member of the League of Nations, the Communist Red Scare that followed WWI, and the stock market crash of 1929.  Events that women and minorities were major contributors of get special treatment while other big events, such as Prohibition, are briefly discussed. Overall, even though the book skimps over certain major issues and events, THE PERILS OF PROSPERITY provides a nice overview of the time period providing a more balanced account of women and minorities' contributions to the era. The end of the book includes a list of important dates.  I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone interested in American history of that period.</span>

                    <span>I had to read this book for my American History Since 1877 course.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this book.  I thought I knew about the 1920's, and after reading this book I knew that I knew nothing at all.<p>This book covers ever aspect of the decade and gives it more than just a name.  The book covers political, economic, and social issues of the day.  It explains the state of the nation in the previous decade as well to give us better understanding of what was to come at the decades end.  <p>The book was also easy to understand and did not try to overcompensate with formal language.  Anyone could understand the messages conveyed.<p>Overall I enjoyed this book and would read it again just to enjoy it.</span>

                    <span>William Leuchtenberg wrote a very good and informative history about the 1920's. He explains life before 1914, World War 1, Prohibition, The Scopes Trial, The Teapot Dome Scandal, The Presidental Administrations of Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, The Great Depression, and The 1932 Election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. He also covers the role of Women, African-Americans, race relations, and The Ku-Klux-Klan. A book worth reading.</span>

                    <span>This is an outstanding history of pre-Crash America.  Leuchtenburg is one of the country's best historians of the New Deal, but in this text he does a wonderful job of providing the backstory to that era.  Very lively stories, wonderfully written.</span>
