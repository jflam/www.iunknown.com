                    <span>On my first reading of this book, I said, "Huh?"  Then, I attended a corporation seminar.  Both the seminar and Bronchick's book were instrumental in formation of my expertise in the use of corporations for asset protection for my real estate business.  Admittedly, this book is light on details, but the diagrams and examples provided more than make up for that.  Besides, you should seek professional advice anyway in addition to this material.  
<br />
<br />This book is a goldmine for the entrepreneur.  Not only is the advice great for those of us in small business, but the material is a rich source of pratical ideas you can apply to your operation.</span>

                    <span>Once again, Mr. Bronchick does an excellent job of taking complicated legal subjects and making them readable for the average person. I am an attorney as well, and I often recommend this book for clients to read as a primer to the subject (especially when I tell them what it will cost for an hour of my time to explain it!).  There are a few books on the market on asset protection, but this is the only one that is geared towards the landlord or small-time real estate investor. One caveat for the reader- there are some sample forms in the appendix, but they appear to be for example only.  One should always review these concepts with an attorney to make sure the forms are drafted to comply with the client's specific needs and appropriate state law.</span>

                    <span>This book was very reasy to read, considering the magnitude of the subject matter.  Short, but to the point on a variety of topics involving real estate and small business liabilities.  I particularly liked the sample asset protection plans laid out in detailed diagrams.  The book also covered a lot of things NOT to do, such as "trust scams".  There's quite a few legal forms in the appendix, but not enough information on how to fill them out and use them.  For my purposes, however, the book gave me what I needed, which is a bird's-eye view and the background knowledge to visit with an attorney to implement the strategies. Anyone who expects a book give them 100% of the information necessary to draft complex legal documents involving all their assets needs a reality check.</span>

                    <span>After reading several books on the topic, I found this book to be the most helpful.  This was one of the few books I've read on the topic that was geared specifically towards the real estate investor. Other asset protection books I've read are more generic in nature.<p>The topic of corporations and other legal entities is pretty dry and often hard to follow, but this book does a great job of making it simple and easy to understand.  Although the book does give some free legal forms, it does not give you the specific tools necessary to accomplish forming entities.  Then again, I don't expect an $18 book to teach me what a lawyer would charge thousands for.  However, it gave me the necessary info to decide what to do next, which, after visiting with 2 lawyers who didn't know this stuff, was VERY useful!<p>I recently saw Mr. Bronchick speak at a real estate convention. I've been to a lot of seminars and heard a lot of hype, but Bronchick is a straight-up guy, giving no-nonsense advice.  This is refreshing in an industry full of BS artists.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book thinking that it would provide some practical REAL information and examples of asset protection. Basically, this book is all smoke and mirrors and never comes close to detailing exactly 'how' to accomplish any of the 'ideas' that are floated by the author. Most information is presented as a glossary of what something means...who needs that? Skip this book and save yourself the $18.95 plus shipping...it is not worth the money!</span>
