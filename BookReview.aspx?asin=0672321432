                <span id="Label1">Instead of having to learn everything about .NET all at once,  <I>ASP.NET: Tips, Tutorials, and Code</I> offers a better way to start  using the new ASP.NET effectively based on the most important APIs and  programming techniques. For anyone tackling ASP.NET, this book is a  great source of practical advice backed up with real examples.<p>A  standout feature of this text is that it does not try to take on all of  .NET first before showing you how to start actually using ASP.NET. In  the first chapters, you'll learn the most important APIs and  programming techniques for using collections, files, and directories,  uploading files, and the like. Anchored with VB.NET (and some C#  examples), each chapter is written by a separate author (or authors)  with a personal take and advice on topics like database programming  with ADO.NET, XML, and security options. This is a truly winning  approach because it will let beginners or those with experience with  the older ASP standard get going quickly with ASP.NET. Better yet, the  authors have tested their techniques with the current beta in real  code, so you can trust what they say regarding performance, deployment,  and configuration, for example.<p>Final chapters on such advanced  topics as separating data from presentation logic, mobile controls for  wireless devices, and COM/Win32 interoperability with .NET will please  more expert readers. By carving out areas of ASP.NET and exploring them  in depth rather than insisting on broad coverage for its own sake, as  with many of the first round of titles on .NET, this title sets an  admirably high standard as a practical source of programming advice on  a platform that is still under construction.<p>Read this text with or  without a general tutorial for .NET and VB.NET and you will have a  great head start on Microsoft's newest Web development tools and  languages. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>I have read quite a few of the books out there right now on ASP.NET. There are those that are good reference books like the Wrox Press Professional ASP.NET one, but there are not a lot of books (programming in general) that actually read well and leave you feeling like you could actually implement the ideas after one pass of the material. This is one of those rare books that does that really well. Even if you own some other ASP.NET books, you might want to look at this one. The presentation is fast enough to not be boring, and it has a nice overall flow to it. If you like books that get right into the code, this would make for a good choice. The book does not get extremely deep into all areas, but it would be a bit much to expect one book to do that anyway. If you have programmed in ASP before, I think you will really appreciate the book's perspective.</span>

                    <span>The book really stands for the title. I found in the book what I was looking for, something to get me started in ASP.NET without it beeing a begginers guide for novice programers. It takes you through every aspect of ASP.NET wich makes some chapters more interesting than others (ADO.NET, XML, Mobile Devices, etc..) almost all the chapters leave you greedy for more (specially passport authentication, webservices, managing state with SQL-Server) but the book is already 837 pages. This is the first time I see ASP.NET covered in every important aspect (web controls, caching and I never saw passport for example).<BR>A mistake was made, by giving the framework sdk in the cd instead of the sample code, wich you can find in a million zip files in the web.<BR>They also failed in telling the sample code is intended to follow your progress in the book. That means you won't see quality code untill chapter 16 (separating code form presentation). I think they made a good desicion, so if your looking for a source of sample code this is the wrong place (Go to the web).<BR>I don't think this will become a reference book for me. As soon as you become proficient in the platform the book becomes shallow but this is the first time i'm happy with a book since i bought "Hitchhiker's guide to visual basic and SQL". This book succeds in having all the Tips, Tutorials and Code you need to get serious into ASP.NET today!!!!!!!!!!!!!.</span>

                    <span>It is an excellent book. Especially I like the way the authors teach. For a task, first it uses ASP 3.0 to show you how it works and then ASP.NET. It explains the differences between the classical ASP and the ASP.net, why the ASP.net is better. If you use ADO.net, you can't avoid using the namespaces "System.Data.SqlClient" and "System.Data.Oledb", the methods "ExecuteReader()" and "ExecuteNonQuery()". The author gives explanations in an extremely clear way. It tells you what they are, what differences between the two and when to use them. All the ADO examples are made by the both namespaces. It is so clear, there are no nonsense words. Another review mentioned already for another good thing is the Security. I haven't seen any other books to do so. If you are like me - want answers quickly and clearly. You got the right book. Highly recommend!!!!!</span>

                    <span>I have bought many books over the years to aid in my career as a computer programmer from all the major vendors (Microsoft, Wrox, Sams, Osborne etc..) <P>I have 3 SAMS books with a "blue cover" (like this one) and there is something about them.<BR>They all FALL APART!!!<BR>The other 2 I have like this (with the same problem) is: "Microsoft .NET XML web services" and "Building E-commerce sites with the .NET framework". <BR>All three of the books that are made like this from SAMS have all the pages falling out of them, the cover falls off. I tried to glue them but it doesnt come out that great. Its very annoying to have a book you spent maybe 35-40 bucks for and to have the pages all falling off of it and trying to deal with it. It basically makes the reading experience unacceptable because you get tired of dealing with all the pages separating.. <BR> <BR>I tried to let Sams know about this issue, they need to fire their book binders, but its like pulling teeth getting any customer service from them.<P>The content is actually quite good, but I cannot recommend a book that falls apart as you read it (literally). <P>Sorry Sams but you need to address this. I have many other books and I have not ran across this issue but with these "blue-cover" Sams books. Stop trying to cut costs with these cheap book bindings and cheap covers.</span>
