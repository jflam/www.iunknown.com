                <span id="Label1">FINALLY!  There is now a football book for boys 8 to 18 years of age--for their parents--and for football coaches.  THE TURNAROUND, from 0-10 to 10-0 is a comprehensive account of the Chaparral Firebirds' 1997 football season.  This Scottsdale, Arizona high school team had to overcome injuries, parental interference and adversity throughout its season in order to reach the Arizona 4-A State semi-finals.    <P>This story is a firsthand account, told by Coach Chuck Mottley, of the personal dedication by Head Coach Ron Estabrook, the assistant coaches and players in the face of continual adversity.   <P>The journey of young men growing into manhood, their discipline and commitment to a year around weight program, is spelled out in the riveting account of what can be accomplished when egos are set aside and sacrifices are made for the good of the team.  <P>Bruce Snyder, Head Football Coach, ASU has written: "Coach Mottley has captured a moment in time when an outstanding coaching staff and a group of young men could say, 'I gave all that I had to give.'  Simple and straightforward, Coach Mottley makes his point, supports it, and moves on.  The lessons are here to be learned by coaches, administrators and boosters alike."  <P>Paul Coro, sports writer for THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC tells readers," THE TURNAROUND vividly straps a coach's headset on you for exclusive access to the sideline and the locker room.  It's well beyond Football 101.  This is graduate-level curriculum for coaches of any sport who want to breathe life into losing programs."</span>

                    <span>Chuck Motley achieves a very difficult and remarkable milestone in his book The Turnaround. He manages to convey the dedication, commitment, joy and disappointment experienced by a group of young men who believed in themselves beyond the expectations of others. He also conveys in an entertaining and spellbinding manner the lessons these young men learned -- and the lessons their coaches learned in kind -- along the journey that constituted their magical and memorable season, a season that comes along far too seldom and is remembered for a lifetime. Through Coach Motley's words, I came to know the players and coaches at Chaparral High School and was able to share in their highs and lows. As a result, I think I will take some of these lessons and apply them to my own children and to the children that I am privileged to coach in the various youth sports that so many of us as parents are thrust into. They are the lessons of a lifetime. Kudos to Coach Motley for the attributes he has shared with the boys he has coached and for imparting those attributes with his readers.</span>

                    <span>The Turnaround - From 0-10 to 10-0 by Chuck Mottley, with Sandra Ghost; Foreword by Bruce Snyder, Head Coach, ASU. Jubilee Publishing. 1999. 223 pp. photographs, diagrams.<P> You often hear that high-school sports prepare young persons for life's challenges, setbacks, and successes. In The Turnaround, Chuck Mottley shows you how this is so. In 1994, the football team the Chaparral Firebirds of Scottsdale, Arizona, had a 0-10 record. Two years later under Ron Estabrook's coaching leadership, the determination and example of several leading players, and the commitment and support of the entire team, the Firebirds achieved a 10-0 record which gave the team a chance at the state championship.<P> Mottley goes through the team's winning season game-by-game relating the emotional mood of the players and coaches along with highlights of each game, noting plays, strategy, and tactics. The reader gets an inside look at the game of football as well as experiences the team's feelings and circumstances in the course of the season. The Turnaround is an engaging, encouraging story for readers of all ages that gets to the essence of sport. In this day of heavy marketing of professional and college teams featuring their often pampered superstars, Mottley's tale offers a refreshing look--a reminder--at the important place sports can have in the lives of individuals.<P>Henry Berry, Book Reviewer<P>Editor/Publisher, The Small Press Book Review</span>
