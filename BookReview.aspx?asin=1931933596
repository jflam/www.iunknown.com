                <span id="Label1">Rick Reilly, the mainstay of <I>Sports Illustrated</I>'s back page, is a writer with a facile short game, but, as <I>The Life of Reilly</I> makes clear, he was born to go long. As entertaining, clever, witty, and, at times, irate as his rants and raves at the end of each week's issue can be, it's the sheer talent and bravura he displays in the features he's penned for the magazine that best exhibit why he's considered one of the finest sportswriters of our time. If his columns have a way of constantly poking you in the ribs, the longer pieces can sometimes take your breath away.<p>  While <I>The Life of Reilly</I> covers the bases of all major and most other sports, Reilly's writing about golf is especially stellar, and three pieces alone--his chronicle of a round of golf with President Clinton, his account of O.J. Simpson's trials on public golf courses, and his reportage, on deadline, of Jack Nicklaus's sixth victory at Augusta--are worth the volume's greens fee. As beautifully as Reilly can paint the big picture, these pieces display his uncanny eye for detail, his skills as a reporter, and his inventiveness as a writer. On Nicklaus's improbable Masters title at age 46: "Maybe Nicklaus had drawn up a contract with Lucifer for one last major, for that slippery 20th that had eluded him since 1980, for a sixth green blazer. In exchange, Nicklaus would do pro-ams in Hades for the rest of his days. What else could explain it?" What else, indeed.<p>  Reilly provides short postscripts to most of the pieces--some are just pithy, while others open windows onto the writer's craft. They're a nice touch, but then, Reilly's work, in general, is full of them. --<I>Jeff Silverman</I></span>

                    <span>Every Thursday I check the mailbox when I get home, see my Sports Illustrated, and go straight for the back page so I can read Mr. Reilly's column. There is a reason he has been named Sportswriter of the Year so many times, he is simply the best. Reilly writes about the humorous, the sad, and the ironic of sports. I laughed at why he hates the Yankees so much, and almost bawled when reading about the Columbine teacher who gave his life for his students. I do some writing myself and even in my dreams I am not half as good as Mr. Reilly is, and never will be. If you are a fan of good, solid writing, pick this book up and read it over and over again.</span>

                    <span>There are serious columns in the book. The humorous ones are what made me read the book again. The chapter on the Olympics is the funniest thing I have ever read. Anyone who thinks Reilly is boring has no sense of humor.</span>

                    <span>I had the privilege of being interviewed several times by Rick when I was a high school track athlete and he was a young flip-flop wearing sports writer for the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, Colorado earning his stripes covering high school sports.  Even way back then it was obvious that he enjoyed sports writing and it came as little surprise to see him eventually end up as SI's most notable writer.  This collection of some of his best (but not all of his best) SI columns is a gem.  Not all are "laugh out loud" humorous, but many are (a testament to his versatility as a writer).  His postscript comments are also entertaining.  After a thorough reading, this book is a keeper.  I can't wait for Volume 2.</span>

                    <span>My brother told me about this book (since he's a life-long subscriber of SI), and I then got it for my boyfriend.  I couldn't resist reading Barkley's introduction before gift-wrapping it, and then I ended up reading the whole thing.<p>I'd only read a few of Reilly's columns before & had always enjoyed them.  This book presents the best of the best in the perfect package.  Some were laugh-out-loud funny with Reilly's sardonic wit, while others definitely put me in a pensive mood for the next few hours.  <p>The way Reilly writes his columns shows that these stories are about life and that sports are the secondary factor.  This book makes the perfect non-maintstream book gift.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't relate to or get something out of Reilly's columns.</span>
