                    <span>While the completeness of Bezruchka's guide cannot be faulted the tone and style certainly don't compare to Jamie McGuinness's book on the same topic. In comparison this book was quite a chore to read especially since it is peppered with sermons on globalization. An extremely capable guide but there are good alternatives you may find more enjoyable.</span>

                    <span>Fifteen years ago I started my trekking company's operation in Nepal with information from this book! The trek descriptions and the information on organizing a trek offer all the nuts and bolts. The background information is fascinating as are Dr. Bezruchka's views on poverty and culture shock.</span>

                    <span>This is the book that first opened my eyes to Nepal and its culture. It's much more than a guidebook: it has a sensitivity and compassion for its subject that is almost unique in the field of travel writing. It doesn't coddle you with if-it's-day-three-this-must-be-Namche route descriptions, but lets you find your own adventure and gain profound insights along the way. It also has an extensive medical section.</span>

                    <span>Stephen Bezruchka has prepared a valuable and complete guide to trekking in the Nepal / Everest region. The book offers practical advise from years of personal experience for anyone thinking about a trip to the area. Bezruchka also creates a much needed ecological awareness and offers substantial insight into the culture of Nepal. The book is much more than a travel guide and just plain interesting. I don't often give books five stars, but this work was beyond my highest expectations - a labor of love. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>This is the most fantastic travel guide I've ever used and the only one you will need in Nepal. Bezruchka's love and respect for the Nepali people is evident in every line and will enhance your journey to Nepal as well. We followed his advice and had a much richer experience for it. We watched other tourists who didn't follow his advice being laughed at and ignored. The language book and tape that you can order were incredibly helpful, way better than any dictionary. We were able to converse competently which made a huge difference in our experience. Don't bother with the Lonely Planet guide, which just tells you how to get through the country as cheaply as possible. There is so much more to experiencing Nepal than saving a buck here and buck there.</span>
