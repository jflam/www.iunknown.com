                    <span>This book is written for those who are looking to right to the bottom line, something a busy manager can appreciate.  It has offered me several tips on how to make a great presentation.  The only problem I have with the book is that there are quite a lot of typos which can detract from its credibility.  Other than that the information is right on.</span>

                    <span>Presentation Skills for Managers by Jennifer and Mike Rotondo is the ideal book for busy presenters who need a thorough grounding in the art and science of presentation skills. The book is small but very complete, covering everything from planning to execution. Checklists and reviews at the end of each chapter keep you focused and organized.<p>I was very impressed with the wisdom of the two authors. This book doesn't gloss over its topic but rather provides very important information in a readable format. It starts by explaining how you should prepare from the outset and then explains the process of converting your research and outline into a PowerPoint presentation.<p>While this book does not cover PowerPoint in detail, it does explain the necessary steps for using PowerPoint to create a presentation. This combination of theory and practice is unique and very useful because the actual process involves both the conceptualization of the presentation's structure and the execution in PowerPoint. (Microsoft PowerPoint owns about 90% of the market for presentation software.) Clear steps for designing a presentation in terms of layout, consistency, and color guide you through the creation process.<p>Finally, Presentation Skills for Manager explains in detail how to deliver your great presentation, including a guide to dealing with questions, your own nervousness, technical disasters, and much more. After you read this book once, you'll refer to it again and again, whenever you need to create and deliver an important presentation. And hey, aren't all your presentations important?<p>Ellen Finkelstein<br>Author of PowerPoint 2000 Professional Results</span>

                    <span>You can tell Rotondo really knows what she is talking<br>about. This book is a great guide on how to get your<br>point across effectively. She mixes good knowledge on<br>various items from PowerPoint design, room set-up,<br>effective delivery tips, and content structuring. I<br>have attended seminars before on how to give good<br>presentations, but they just focused on public<br>speaking. This book covers everything from the<br>creation process all the way to the `Question &<br>Answer' session at the end of a presentation. The easy<br>layout of every chapter with icons and helpful hints<br>ensures that the reading is short and concise.  I have<br>found this is a great "go-to" book whenever I start a<br>new presentation.</span>
