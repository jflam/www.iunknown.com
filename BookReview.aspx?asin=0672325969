                    <span>You get what you pay for. For the admission price, you get a quick no-nonsense walkthrough of someone else's exploratory code in Direct3D. You don't get commentary on what, why, and motivations. Maybe I'm a bit jaded, or maybe C# reads almost like English. The shallow explanatory text is a little jarring to read after browsing the code listings. ("Didn't I just read this?")
<br />
<br />Polished versions of the book's code ships with the DX9.0c SDK. This is both good and bad. The book was written by a key member of the managed DirectX team. This is a good thing. OTOH, the accompanying text offers very little beyond the SDK samples. There is some compensating value in being able to browse it offline.
<br />
<br />The coding style is clear and linear, perhaps just right for illustrating concepts, but not one you want to emulate. Overall, the book lacks the deeper discussion that the SDK samples want for; you won't find that between its covers. While far from a hearty recommendation, it's not at all a condemnation. The book is precisely what it purports to be: a kickstart primer to programming DirectX in C#, teaching by example but not much beyond.

                    <span>You can not get any of the sample code to compile in Visual Studio 2003.  compiler kicks out error after error in the debugger.  Invalid parameters, null reference, etc. etc. after chapter 3 forget about debugging.  Hours and hours of researching MSDN and still no executeable code.  So once again, you can create that pretty little 3 colored triangle, thats about it. When are "experts" ever going to give us some practical learning tools?  C# the OOP oops! :grumbles: SOS!</span>

                    <span>First off, if you don't have a firm grasp of C# and the .NET Framework, at least in a basic sense, this book isn't for you. I think the cover and intro make this obvious, but people forget to read those sometimes!
<br />
<br />That said, I doubt I'll ever have to write DX9 code myself, but as someone that likes to play with code not involving a financial application in his spare time, this is a beautiful introduction to the platform. You can do some really neat things without a lot of experience. If you want to make something dance around in a window on a Windows machine, get this book. Then graduate to bigger picture graphics theory (a place I have no desire to go).</span>

                    <span>   There are almost no books on directX 9.0 and C#, so any help is appreciated.  First thing is that the sample code that is promised on the CD just isn't there, though some other very interesting ones are.  The best demos on the CD are all copyright Microsoft, so I'm not sure how much you can really use them as helper classes(?).  The version of direct X is already behind, so there are changes to make if you have Summer 2004, like I do.  Chapter 1 explains that without normals, surface colors are all black, then every example after that has no normals, so they do not show up.  All and all if you are a good coder and have the time you can work through it and learn some important lessons.  Since material is so scare for C# Direct X, I would give this book an average grade of 3 stars.</span>

                    <span>Originally I gave this book only one star due to my high disappointment of not having any executables on the CD and not being able to view the sample code with Visual C++ 6.0.
<br />
<br />That review was written on the day I got the book in the mail.  You know how it is, you order something and when it comes in you immediately want to play with your new toy.  I could not.  
<br />
<br />After reading the book for awhile, I have come to the conclusion that I was being too harsh.  The book does have a lot of good stuff in it.  You just need Visual C#.  
<br />
<br />Personally, I think the author should have put Visual C++ 6.0 versions on all examples on the CD.  After all, Microsoft has Visual C++ versions of all their DirectX 9.0 sample code.
<br />
<br />So, for all you Visual C# people out there, I do highly recommend this book.  For the Visual C++ people, the author does an excellent job of explaining the concepts.  But it will be a learning experience to translate the code to C++.
<br />
<br />By the way, not all books written in C# require C#.  Clayton Walnum's Direct3D Programming Kick Start was written in C#, but the sample code was such that I was able to view it with Visual C++ 6.0, and with some minor modifications was able to get it to compile.  It had .cpp files.  Miller's book does not.  Walnum also had executables.  
<br />
<br />To conclude:  I give this book 4 stars.  The reason why 1 star appears above my review, is that when you go to edit your review, you are NOT allowed to change your star rating.  Just the text.
