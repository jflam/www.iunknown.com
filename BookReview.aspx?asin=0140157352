                    <span>I like this negotiation book because it emphasizes the win-win situation yet its system is flexible enough to deal with those who do not want to play that way.  On the other hand, I am still intrigued by the use of standards.  The authors propose that, in order to achieve some level of, shall we say "fairness," one should resort to the use of established standards that help both parties to gain a perspective.  One example was about oil drilling rights in international waters.  There was a disagreement that polarized relatively rich nations against relatively poor nations, and only after the discovery and use of an oil drilling economics model developed at MIT did the impasse begin to melt.  However, what happens if the standard/model itself is developed with a biased opinion?  One example might be the customs used in apartheid South Africa that were clearly biased towards whites.  In summary, this book has important points (e.g. look at the interests behind the positions), but more work could be done to clarify the use of some principles.</span>

                    <span>Getting to Yes is a book that focuses on negotiation techniques you can use to get a fair deal without sacrificing the relationship. 
<br />
<br />Fisher and Ury give some excellent advice for negotiation such as focusing on the problem and interests, not digging yourself into a position, how to handle overpowering and dirty negotiators, and work on problem solving by creating options.
<br />
<br />I was mostly impressed by the author's description of how to maintain integrity without giving in.  I was also impressed with the step-by-step scenario they had of the negotiation with the landlord that had charged over the rent control limit.
<br />
<br />On the down side, I really wished there were more examples in this book.  While there certainly were a few, I was left wanting more in order to understand the techniques given.  Also I found some of the language to be dry, but this is not a huge issue.
<br />
<br />Getting to Yes is definitely a book you want to read and we all have to negotiate at some point in our lives.  4 out of 5 stars.</span>

                    <span>I took Fisher's negotiation class when I was Harvard, and the book provides a great BASIC skills introduction to the Harvard negotiation style.  Anyone with reasonably advanced negotiations skills will be disappointed, but the book really opens up the negotiating process to the average reader.  Getting to Yes is very readable and useful, but not too comprehensive or terribly sophisticated by any means.</span>

                    <span>This book was recommended reading as part of a class in negotiation at NYU.  I was a bit skeptical at first, as the cover made it look like the kind of popculture books they sell in grocery store check-out lines. I was quickly proven wrong.  I just hope I will be able to apply the lessons learned therein. Up to know I have engaged mostly in what the authors call "positional bargaining." I now know the difference between this and "prinicipled negotiation," which will hopefully help me get over my Scorpio tendency of stinging anyone who disagrees with me!</span>

                    <span>From "Getting to Yes": 
<br />
<br />"Reading the pamphlet on the Royal Canadian Air Force exercises will not make you physically fit. Studying books on tennis, swimming, riding a bicycle, or riding a horse will not make you an expert. Negotiation is no different."
<br />
<br />Wise words indeed. Anyone expecting a "how-to" method from any book on negotiation is in the wrong field of study. The best one can expect is a general framework, and that is what this book provides.
<br />
<br />Fisher and Ury advocate what they refer to as "principled negotiation", a style of negotiation where there are no winners and losers. Agreements are reached rationally by considering the motives each party has for maintaining a their position. People are separated from the issues at hand, and emotions are controlled. There is a strong emphasis on rationality, using objective criteria.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, human beings aren't always capable of controlling their emotions and being rational. Or sometimes simply refuse to negotiate. Fisher and Ury recognize this, and provide a framework for tackling these issues, centered on what they call BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).
<br />
<br />Overall a great book, but, as the authors themselves would concede, no substitution to negotiation experience. </span>
