                    <span>After reading both books, I must agree that this one has  a lot of mistakes in it and can sometimes be a bit confusing. If you don't want to spend too much money but need a practical introduction then choose this book, if you plan on spending anyway, just buy 'Oracle 10g: the complete reference' straight away. It's better structured, everything used in examples is explained well. It's not a bad book but compared to the complete reference it's confusing. If you just installed oracle 10g on your computer, be sure to unlock the HR, OE, PM, IX, SH schemes if you want to be able to reproduce the exercises. (I found that nowhere referenced and it might be a bit confusing for a total newbie to find out) </span>

                    <span>I have been a SQL Server DBA for years along with FoxPro, DB2, etc.  But I still found this book very confusing.
<br />
<br />Is it just me or did the examples not match anything in the Oracle 10g sample database that I loaded?  Plus the EM did not even look the same.  What's with that?  Kind of hard to do the examples when nothing matches.
<br />
<br />Worst beginners book I've ever read.  If it wasn't for the fact that I was familiar with some of the concepts already, this book would have been totally useless.
<br />
<br />If you are a true beginner, look for a different book.  This one won't help.</span>

                    <span>The examples use very different tables. No table creation and table insertion procedures are in the downloadable sql examples. This makes the reconstruction of the examples almost impossible.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>It's a good, solid introduction to 10g.  I've worked with other relational DBMSs for years, but have never touched Oracle.  This book starts you out with a useful overview of the Oracle processes (something the O'Rielly book, in my opinion, spends way too much time on), and then gets you started with Oracle (though it assumes you already have a system up - but that's only a couple hour exercise once you d/l the CDs from oracle.com and read the documentation at otn.oracle.com).  It does have a few typos in it (all too common in tech books these days!), but as for "all the .tifs" that another reviewer metioned - there are only 2 .tifs and you can d/l them from the book's website.  I haven't noticed any weird writing style - it sounds like any other tech book I've read.  The self-checks and exercises throughout are good refreshers of your reading.  My problem with the O'Rielly book is that it's much more theory than this one; sounds much more like my textbook for my second semester database course ("this is how you code a DBMS").  This book, in contrast, actually gives you stuff to try on a working Oracle installation.  If you want to learn how a B+ tree works under the covers, the O'Rielly book might be worth looking at.  But if you want to try using Oracle, grab this one.</span>

                    <span>I am not a fan of the style in which this book is written.  I find it distracting.  There's something about the presentation of the information that annoys me.  And what's up with all the .tif files?  Am I supposed to have coincident online access to get the most out of this book?  
<br />Also, there are enough errors that I find them both annoying and sometimes simply confusing.  
<br />This book contains a strange hodgepodge of incomplete topics. To me it seems hastily conceived and I wouldn't recommend it.</span>
