                    <span>I got this book on a Friday and I read at least half on Friday and Saturday.
<br />
<br />I thought I was a tech savvy, but after reading this book, I guess I'm not (I'm going to be after I finish reading it). I believe I knew at most one quarter of the tips/suggestions/fixes of the book, and that is because I do a lot of reading (magazines, articles, etc..). I found a lot of annoyances that I did not know they annoyed me, and that was awesome. Even in Excel, I consider myself an advanced user (almost expert) and I found tips on one thing that I did not know.
<br />
<br />The book talks about several different topics and areas, giving everyone (even the poor AOL people) some great suggestions. Writing is clear and fun to read, making it very enjoyable.
<br />
<br />Great job Steve!!!

                    <span>I could hardly put the book down when I received it. I was able to use one of the tips right away and it worked. I teach computing for beginners at the local Senior Center and I am going to recommend this book to my students. This book is written in clear English not geek-speak which makes it useful for all levels of computer users. I thought that the book was easy to use, funny and a great reference book as well as a book that is helpful in time of need. On the book's special website there are more than 150 downloadable tools and utilities which are listed alphabetically and by the chapter titles from the book. Buy this book you will learn a lot.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>If you own the first edition, you won't experience déjà vu while reading the second edition. The new one has many changes that you won't recognize it. Whether you're a power PC user or a casual one, you will benefit from the book. Because of the wide array of topics covered, I can't imagine many geeks who know all of these tips.  
<br />
<br />Instead of calling tech support and staying on hold or going to Google, check PC Annoyances for the answers. It's impossible to have the answers to all the problems you encounter on a PC, but Bass touches on a bit of everything. If you don't find the answer in the book, you might find enough clues to shorten your search.
<br />
<br />GMail joins the book and its tips immediately pay off. Other than the usual Microsoft applications, get stress-busters for fixing annoyances related to music, video, CD, and general email. Mozilla, Firefox, and Thunderbird don't make the cut this time. However, we know how the publishing industry struggles to keep up with tech changes. The book lists a few Netscape-related tips and what you can do in Netscape usually works in any Mozilla product since they're based on the same "bones."
<br />
<br />How many times have you come across an interesting URL in a book that was a mile long and took several attempts to get it right? Bass takes care of that by using a URL shortening service making it easier and quicker to get the right URL on the first try. He provides links to software, humorous sites, and resources. After fighting a round with your PC, wouldn't taking a break by going to a funny resource release a few tense muscles? It does for me.
<br />
<br />His software recommendations include free and fee-based products. I recognize many of the programs and own some. Based on my experience, he provides excellent recommendations, so you can trust that he isn't looking to pump up his stock with any of the companies. Most, if not all, of the programs come with a trial period, so you can play with them and see if they meet your needs. If not, uninstall and no harm done. If so, then thank Mr. Bass.
<br />
<br />The only complaint I have lies with the warning boxes. They're dark blue with black text. Not easy to read. 
<br />
<br />Bass writes likes someone who has battled with the annoyance and shares the solution. It's conversational, enjoyable, and easy reading. You don't have to worry about insults from those who think they're the sultan of computers. Instead, Bass makes you feel better with his "buddy-style" advice. Thanks, Steve.</span>

                    <span>Steve did a nice job on this one. Common PC problems are easy to find in the text, simply explained and for the most part easily resolved by following the advice in the book. This is a good tool for the novice user managing a home machine, but holds enough information, tips and tricks for the IT pro to learn a thing or two about Windows.
<br />
<br />I sent a copy to my Dad.

                    <span>If you use a PC, you should consider picking up this book. I've subscribed to Bass's free PC World newsletter (http://www.pcworld.com/resource/columnist/0,colid,43,00.asp), which I also recommend, for more than a year. I bought PC Annoyances mainly as a gesture of appreciation for the newsletter, and it's turned out to be a great purchase, with lots of helpful tips (finally I can delete old System Restore points) and URLs for mostly free software. Details, including a sample chapter, are available at http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pcannoy2/.
<br />
<br />And no, I haven't taken a bribe from Bass for this review, though my PayPal account, like the Hotel California, is programmed to receive.</span>
