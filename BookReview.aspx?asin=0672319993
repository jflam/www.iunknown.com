                    <span>If you learn from deconstructing pre-built flash applications, you'll love this book.  This book is full of useful flash applications such as an online store, a services catalog, a user survey, a threaded message board, and smaller more common examples, such as flash player sniffers, and preloaders.  It shows you how to add quicktime movies to an application, work with various server-sided languages such as asp with an access database, or php with a mysql database and XML.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  It's one of my very favorate flash books.  The book's written for Flash 5, but the examples are still better than newer published books ... it's not easy to find good server-sided Flash books.</span>

                    <span>Flash is all about snazzy sites. You don't need Flash if you're gonna make flat stupid looking sites like this book shows. Get a clue - look how many USED copies are for sale with UNOPENED CD's... The book is decieving - at first glance you think "Yeah!" until you get it home and realize that it's all smoke and mirrors with no substance and certainly no use of Flash in the modern designer sense. You call up their demo site and it's like "uhh?" - flat as a pancake.</span>

                    <span>exactly what i had been looking for.   funny how it shouldny have worked on my computer according to one review:<p>"<br>You need to have your computer installed with the following: Operating System:	Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, Software:	Active Server Pages 2.0 or higher (included with IIS), Apple QuickTime Player (included with IIS), Microsoft CDONTS (included with the Option Pack), Microsoft Data Access Components 2.5 or higher, Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 or higher, Microsoft XML Parser 3.0 or higher (included with the Data Access Components), MySQL 3.23 or higher (included on this CD-ROM), Real Networks Real Video Player.<p>So, if you do not have NT4 or Windows 2000 on your computer, are you ready to make the change?? Think before you buy this book. <br>"<p>worked just fine on my iMac. Running 9.2  inside OS-X.  just though that some people might appreciate having this pointted out.</span>

                    <span>A great book!.  Everyone knows (and criticizes) Flash for slick animation and splash pages. Most books focus on Flash as an animators tool. This book demonstrates advanced Flash interface design from start to finish - including dynamic content and database integration.</span>

                    <span>The full operating system and software requirements listed are necessary for a few of the movies included: the Online Store and Cart, the Dynamic News and Reviews and the Threaded Message Board. As those movies generate dynamic content, it was necessary to make a decision as to which back-end system to use. We chose Windows NT/2000 and Active Server Pages because they have the largest install base. However, anything that we've included can be modified to work with another back end system.<p>The rest of the movies, which include the Home Page, the Viewer Survey, the Services Catalog, the Preview Links and the Container Movie, can be modified and used on any platform or system. <p>Whilst I only worked on part of the book, it was a great experience and I hope that everyone has just as a great time learning as I did writing.</span>
