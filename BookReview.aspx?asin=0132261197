                    <span>This book was the very first book I bought on computers programming (ok it was the second -- the first one I bought when I was 10...but this was the first serious one). I bought it when I was 12 years old, and the examples and text were very clear to me! If a 12 year old can understand this, think how easy it will be for you! This book does a great job of explaining every detail of OOP and programming, starting the book off with the basics of computer programming. You don't need to have any programming experience in order to read this book. I was a little disappointed in the actual result of it's claim to teach both C *and* C++ in the same book. It had very little on how to use C-specific things, not even mentioning how to use printf(). Thsi book is also great for those of you who know C and want to learn C++. You will have the easiest time learning OOP. The book also has some great reference information in the back, such as the C standard library, number systems, etc.</span>

                    <span>I love a book that is not afraid to slow down to actually teach you something. The authors have done everything successfully, from grouping the topics, to ordering the flow of the chapters, to the code itself. The tips and pitfalls provide sanity checks for common mistakes, and to the attentive reader should save lots of time.<P>True, this book may not delve deeply into all the obscurities that C/C++ has to offer, but for its purposes as 1) a tutorial, 2) an introduction to programming, and 3) an accessible treatment of 95% of C/C++, it works! (It is probably advisable to avoid the abstruse 5% anyway.) I still reference this book occasionally, so it's an enduring text.<P>Other books, such as the 21 Days series, gloss over the details and give the reader the false notion s/he has achieved some sort of quick mastery. Afterwards, you may as well throw it out because it is useful only once. On the other end of the spectrum, is the C++ Primer, written by Stanley Lippman. That text reeks of loftiness and obscurity. After you've programmed C/C++ for a few years, put that book on your shelf to impress others.<P>But if you like learning and want to experience the fun that is C/C++ programming, go with Deitel & Deitel.</span>

                    <span>The book is really easy to understand. It is straight forward and to the point. Most of all technical terminology is defined for the beginner. <P>I especially appreciate the fact that the authors have mentioned that they have tried to present C in such a way to be the first computer language for beginners, despite in traditional terms, Pascal being taught as the first programming language because of it's known structured programming discipline.<P>In my lower years of education, I have had experiences with QBasic and a little of Visual Basic. However, as a student, I would think that skipping Pascal is a plus since I tend to ask myself, "When am I ever going to use it in life..." Students tend to question the applicable use of something that is learned.<BR>These days, Pascal is seldom used as C++ predominantly takes the stage.<P>In sum, learning C as a foundation and first language seems to be something that will pay off. This book also includes tips and points out common pitfalls such as common programming errors, good programming practices, performance tips, and software engineering observations, which are all really helpful. If you are new to programming, this book is a must.</span>

                    <span>Sir(s), I am employed to Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited. About four or more years ago I was sent to their inhouse training school to do a one week course in C programming, I was at a loss, I learned nothing. A couple of months ago, my wife decided to do a computer course (C programming followed my visual basic 6 then java) she is now at the visual stage. When she began, I took out my old manual (from C&WJ training school) and surprizingly I was able to help her in the early stages, but then the tables were turned and I got jealous. I read and read and read until I began to understand. I realized that the manual I had was chock full of information but it is hard to understand without someone to explain. Thank you for helping me to understand. "C HOW TO PROGRAM" the second edition is now a part of my library and I feel very strongly that I have made a worthwhile purchase. I am now doing the exercises at the end of chapter three but it's a pity I do not have "someone" at hand to ask questions when I need to, by the way, writing the pseudocode is giving me a bit of a challenge, so I just go straight into writing the C programs. Imagine that, I am teaching myself. Any advice? P. S. I love C. Devon</span>

                    <span>I bought this book a year ago, (and i am 11 years old, NO JOKE!) and i thought this book was great! It was easy to understand, clear, and fun! I didnt want to put it down! Another great book on C is the (in)famous K&R! (Kerningham & Ritchie!) That was also a great book</span>
