                <span id="Label1">For those who immediately associate Italian cooking with meatballs and red sauce, Faith Willinger has a treat. She has composed a cookbook of everyday, family Italian recipes that rely on vegetables and tradition. Each chapter features a specific vegetable, offering recipes and entertaining explanations on the traditional purpose of specific dishes. Try Carmignano fennel seed-spiced dried figs or Torquato's Rice and Cabbage Soup--her concoctions are creative yet simple to make.</span>

                    <span>While living in Italy, I learned to appreciate the Italian way of cooking vegetables which combined fresh ingredients with simple preparations, creating amazing results, and Faith Willinger's book on Italian vegetables is packed full of these types of recipes. As the host of my own Italian cuisine website Italian Food Forever, I love to prepare vegetables in the Italian manner, and this book has become a great resource for me. Each chapter highlights a vegetable, with a little history of each thrown in with great recipes. If you like vegetables, you'll enjoy this book.</span>

                    <span>Anyone that knows the Cooking talent of this woman KNOWS that her recipes are wonderfully simple and easy to prep. This to me makes cooking so much more fun than a 25 step recipe with less than satisfactory results. "Sometimes.. the simple things are the best things" So is true with Faith and her way of working with food. Great food with ease !!! Always a wonderful treat for the eyes...nose..and mouth when I cook one of her recipes! She is a true Diva or her art. Luv Ya FAITH!!!</span>

                    <span>The other day I opened the fridge and discovered that I have some zuchhini. I opened up Red White and Greens under "zuchhini", and within a little while I was eating wonderful zuchhini carpaccio. The next day I found out I still have some leeks from my last shopping. I opened the book under "leek", and discovered how simple it would be to make roasted leek. It was delicous. And when I had some pecorino romano --- well, just look under garlic for a beautiful salad. Faith Willinger, who took us thorough Northern Italy in her "Eating in Italy", here gives simple and delicous Italian recipies for vegetables. Everything I tried is easy to understand and prepare, and became an instant "classic" in our household. Some of the recipies are from Firenze's wonderful Cibreo restaurant, and they are definitley clearer here than they are in the little Cibreo cookbook. Anyone who likes vegetables and loves Italian food will delight in this book. It's a real asset to have. And yes, as some have complaines, some of the ancedotes are repititve, but they still provide fun reading, and even more fun cooking. So get this book, and start maybe with the leek and lemon sauce for pasta. Can I have some more of that, please?</span>

                    <span>I buy cookbooks as much for the reading material as for the recipes, but in this case, reading carefully brings out the worst in the book. Willinger seems to have keyed her computer to spit out the same few sentences every time she mentions Tuscany ( a lot) or a certain Torquato (the man she buys vegetables from, so he also rates many mentions) or the almanac from which she gets much of her historical information. The recipes, too, disappoint. Many of them are the sort of thing you'd come up with on your own such as sauteeing a given vegetable in parsley, garlic, and olive oil. All in all, this is one of the most disappointing cookbook purchases I have made in a long time. The glowing reviews, of course, contributed to my sense of disappointed expectations, leading me to conclude that the world of cookbook publishing runs on the same hype that fuels potboilers.</span>

There is very little fancy food here, just good, tasty cooking by a lady who knows her vegetables. This book is one of the smartest additions I ever made to my (large) collection of cook books. BUY IT NOW! You, your family, and your friends will be glad you did.</span>
