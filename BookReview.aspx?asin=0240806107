                    <span>I bought this book for a photography class at Temple University, and it now serves as a wonderful guide and mentor toward all aspects of photojournalism. Readings from this book provided much debate and learning experiences for our class. <P>For photography students, this book is top notch. For photo editors or freelance photographers, this book may serve as a useful guide, especially in the area of ethics when taking and publishing pictures. <P>This is a valuable book that will remain on my bookshelf until a new edition rolls out. Through the excellence of this book, the author has earned my loyalty for another edition. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>I'm been reading this book for a Photo course. The Material on it is quite interesting and the writing is pretty clear. I have been studing photography for about 3 years now and by far this is one of the best books you could ever hold on your book shell. A++ to a great writter and author. Will recomend this book to other college students that are persuding to go into the a photo journalist aventure like myself.</span>

                    <span>Just as Strunk and White's "The Elements of Style" is considered required reading for any writer, Kobre's "Photojournalism, The Professionals' Approach" is an essential instructional manual for the aspiring or advanced photojournalist.<P>As a working photographer for almost 20 years, I've owned previous editions of Kobre's book and always make it a point to keep one within reach. I recommend it to anyone interested in photojournalism, especially high school and college students. While filled with detailed photographic theory and principles, the format of the book is very easy to follow and introduces fundamentals and advanced techniques with equal ease. <P>Perhaps my most-read sections are the chapters on ethics and the responsibilities of the photographer to the community they serve. Society requires a photojournalist to be held accountable for their actions; to be honest and compassionate, yet unflinchingly accurate when reporting the news. <P>Although the price tag is a bit on the high side, the information Kobre shares is priceless.</span>
