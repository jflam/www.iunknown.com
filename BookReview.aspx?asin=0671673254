                    <span>This is a grandfather of body language books. It is one of the few that kicked off the discussion of body language and non-verbal commincation. What some of the reviewers are looking for is a book of poker tells or a college text book. Communications was my major in college so I have read dozen's of "in-depth" books on this matter. The book is short and the content is brief but well written. I say it is a great read for anyone interested in the subject. Take it for what it is and enjoy.</span>

                    <span>This is a classic little book about the art of reading body language. As the editor of Charm Magazine, I've researched this topic in depth. This book doesn't tell it all, but it is THE place to start. I assure you that all the body language authors out there have read this book. <P>Readers may be turned off by some of the outdated scenarios and old-fashioned language. The use of "men" to describe both men and women is particularly confusing, especially because Fast sometimes uses "men" to mean just men. <P>Some surprising topics covered in this book include communicating with animals, viewing people as "non-persons" (which is quite relevant to issues like sexism), and even S&M. <P>On a personal note, I was pleased to see a section on "bedroom eyes," a phrase I've heard for years without truly understanding what it referred to, lol. <P>Another section of interest is a brief foray into the body language used in the Arab world. I can't vouch for the accuracy of his research into the Arab culture, but it's worth thinking about, especially in our post 9/11 world.</span>

                    <span>Fast, Julius. Body Language. New York: M. Evans and Company Inc, 1970.<P>Julius Fast, the author of Body Language, a former senior editor at Medical News, and previous teacher of Body Language at The New School For Social Research and at Connecticut State College, throughout this book refers to many psychologists opinions and research. Some include Dr. Arnold Buchheimer, Dr. Albert E. Scheflen, and Michael Wolff. The information that is discussed gives the reader a good understanding about the basis of the study of kinesics, the study of body language. Many different areas such as posture, space, and masking are all combined allowing you to recognize what a person is really thinking, putting light upon a unique area of the study of language. Although this 1970 edition, published by M. Evans and Company Inc., and the second publication, released in 1988, are both somewhat outdated, the ideas and opinions discussed provide a good understanding for the reader that is uneducated in this topic and still well represents the ideas that have since then been further developed in a logical order. The book at the time of release received positive reviews, the Daily News saying, "Julius Fast's fascinating book tells how social scientists are discovering that your body cannot lie!" The book still remains in print today.</span>

                    <span>I've noticed a lot of negative reviews for this book. They seem to be written by people who think there is some mysterious science, or set of "tricks" that can be deployed using body language.<P>This is not a book of tricks. It will not teach you any weird occultic secrets or mystical rites. If you're looking for the "unfair advantage" that gets so heavily hyped on the Web, it's not here. It's not anywhere else, either (lol).<P>This IS, however, a great book for understanding the essential science of nonverbal communication through body language. It is an awesome introduction to the science and, frankly, none of the books that have followed have done much to improve on it.<P>A couple of specifics...If you want to know if a woman is interested in you, that section of this book is pretty good. If you want to learn how to communicate your interest in a woman, without having to say a word, read the chapter about "Mike." It's dynamite. I've used it many times to express attraction for a woman. It works like magic.<P>And the wild thing is, these techniques also create attraction in women when you use them.<P>So don't believe the "short cut" seekers who have blasted this book. It's a cool, wise, intriguing read.</span>

                    <span>I did not get much from this book. It is very general and does not teach you the art of body language. It only tells you a few good points. Most of the books is useless in your future life.</span>
