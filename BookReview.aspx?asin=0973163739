<br />Category Matches 
<br />Setting Search Preferences

                    <span>I saw this book while searching for search engine optimization books, and this one came up as one of the recommended books.  Yes, I may have not been the right audience, but this would apply to everyone.<p>The title should be changed to "Fit for the garbage can in 30 seconds or less."  My god, if you have ever done 10 or more searches on Google (which almost everyone has), you'll find this book absolutely useless.  You can get more information by simply visiting this page http://www.google.com/about.html<p>I have nothing against the author or publisher, but thought I'd do this system justice by giving my honest opinion.</span>

                    <span>This book takes a vast subject, and breaks it down into short and easily digested sections that I suspect most people will read in one sitting. Although its size does limit it somewhat from expanding on certain points it does come together as a well presented and easy to follow guide. Good for beginners or casual users of Google.</span>
