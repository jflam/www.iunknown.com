                <span id="Label1">With <i>Naked Prey</I>, John Sandford proved again that his writing is as fresh and compulsively readable as ever. "This is vintage Sandford, which is to say all but impossible to put down," said <i>The Washington Post</i>. "Sprawling, suspenseful, tough-minded [and] sheer fun." <br><br> Six months ago, Lucas Davenport tackled his first case as a statewide troubleshooter, and he thought that one was plenty strange enough. But that was before the Russian got killed. On the shore of Lake Superior, a man named Vladimir Orslov is found shot dead, three holes in his head and heart, and though nobody knows why, everybody-the local cops, the FBI, and the Russians themselves-has a theory. And when it turns out he had very high government connections, that's when it hits the fan. <br><br> A Russian cop flies in from Moscow, Davenport flies in from Minneapolis, law enforcement and press types swarm the crime scene-and, in the middle of it all, there is another murder. Is there a relationship between the two? What is the Russian cop hiding from Davenport? Is she-yes, it's a woman-a cop at all? Why was the man shot with . . . fifty-year-old bullets? Before he can find the answers, Davenport will have to follow a trail back to another place, another time, and battle the shadows he discovers there-shadows that turn out to be both very real and very deadly.</span>

                    <span>John Sandford's Prey series has been called riveting, compulsively readable, and splendid. It is all of these. Then, just when you think this author couldn't possibly pen a story any more dynamite reading than the last he does. "Hidden Prey" is Sandford in top form - it's surprising, exciting with action aplenty.<P> There's little rest for popular protagonist Lucas Davenport in this one. With the discovery of a dead Russian on the shores of Lake Superior Davenport feels like it's deja vu the Cold War in today's Minnesota.<P>Before long the FBI discovers that the murdered man had KGB connections. Was he a Russian intelligence agent? Everyone has both questions and theories - Davenport arrives on the scene, a Russian policeman jets in from Moscow, law enforcement officers investigate, and reporters of every ilk converge.<P>A barrage of violent events cloud the original crime: a homeless woman is garroted, a bar owner is attacked, and a police officer is shot. Despite the confusion Davenport finds out a few things he didn't want to know - this part of his home state once sheltered a bunch of Communist sympathizers, and there's every indication that this cell is alive and well once again.<P>There's much for Davenport to retrace - another place, another time - all of which puts him in peril. Yet, this must be done before he can begin to unravel this many layered mystery.<BR>If you liked "Naked Prey" you'll be delighted WIth "Hidden Prey." Or, if you haven't read any of the Prey series - treat yourself.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I've read all of Sandford's previous PREY novels as well as his KIDD novels; at this point, the KIDD novels, particularly the last two offerings, are easily the better reads, in my opinion. While the PREY novels are noted for simple yet intriguing storylines, HIDDEN PREY goes the opposite direction. Sandford decides to take an improbable storyline, a rather complex one at that, and tones down our hero, Lucas Davenport. In the end, this makes for a very apathetic read, particularly if you've enjoyed the sharp edge of Davenport in novels past.<P>HIDDEN PREY begins with the murder of a Russian merchant marine, or so it seems. Soon thereafter, a homeless woman is garroted, the site extremely gruesome. What appears to be two unrelated murders turns into an apparent murder/cover-up and Lucas Davenport is called in to begin an investigation. Lucas is partnered with a Russian "police officer," sent over by Moscow to oversee the investigation of the murdered Russian. Lucas smells a rat immediately and, throughout the book, peppers the Russian officer for information and "why" she's truly there.<P>So as not to spoil the remaining plot...Sandford is obviously sending Davenport through middle age. He is mellowing Lucas and dulling his previously sharp edge. And, while this may follow the chronology of 15 previous PREY novels (i.e. Lucas aging), it is not why most people read fiction. Although there are bursts of brutality and violence, the vast majority of the book traces the witness/suspect interrogation lines and a painfully slow amalgamation of puzzle pieces in an effort to solve the crimes. And, not to counteract the lack of suspense, even the climax fails to thrill. <P>Sandford laid his claim to fiction with the first few PREY novels; Spillaneish in their simplicity and Parkerish in their character builds. Davenport was a tough, no-nonsense cop who would tread on the imaginary line in the sand to catch the bad guy; almost no cost too great. Well, we now have a more retiring figure to deal with in Davenport. And, while this too can produce good storylines, it is something PREY fans will have to adjust to: not an easy transition, to be sure.</span>

                    <span>This is worse than Easy Prey. And not because Lucas is an old married man but because he seems to have lost all of his detecting ability. What happened to the logical, game playing brain? Where are the brilliant leaps of intuitive insight? Where is the sex appeal? Where is the intensity? Where is Lucas Davenport?!!!<P>Aside from the character being less than exciting, I found the the plot development to be lacking. When the reader knows from the beginning "who done it", the author must engage your attention with the clever ways in which the hero figures it out.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>John Sandford has done well in keeping Lucas Sanderson such an interesting and complex character. In HIDDEN PREY, Lucas pairs up with a Russian agent, Nadya, in the search for the killer of a Russian spy. Readers know that the killer is a young boy named Carl Walthers, mentored by his 92 year old great grandfather. Walthers and his elderly teacher are pretty clever in staging accompanying deaths to throw Lucas off. <BR>There are several tense scenes, but HIDDEN PREY is a little more "relaxed" and "leisurely" in its tone than previous PREY books. This is not necessarily bad, but Hidden doesn't match some of the intense psychological battles Lucas has fought in previous cases. Sandford of course keeps things moving well and his narrative style is as sharp as ever. Another thing is (spoiler alert), the killer is never truly brought to justice. In the next book maybe?</span>

                    <span>I enjoy John Sandford's books, especially the Prey novels. But in 'Hidden Prey' the plot centers around a spy ring, instead of Davenport chasing down a killer. It just didn't feel right. And the ending was kind of a let down. <BR>If you're a big Sandford fan this is worth the money, but if you're new to John Sandford I'd start with one of his earlier books, Mind Prey, Certain Prey and Naked Prey are my favorites.</span>
