                <span id="Label1">Wallace Stegner's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is a story of discovery--personal, historical, and geographical. Confined to a wheelchair, retired historian Lyman Ward sets out to write his grandparents' remarkable story, chronicling their days spent carving civilization into the surface of America's western frontier. But his research reveals even more about his own life than he's willing to admit. What emerges is an enthralling portrait of four generations in the life of an American family.<br><br>Like other great quests in literature, Lyman Ward's investigation leads him deep into the dark shadows of his own life. The result is a deeply moving novel that, through the prism of one family, illuminates the American present against the fascinating background of its past.</span>

                    <span>Wallace Stegner's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Angle of Repose" is one of those highly readable, but long, works that has a sort of uncomplicated depth while coming at us from a number of narrative angles. In many ways, it is a personal history of the American West - not the conquering or taming of it, but the hardscrabble give and take of a pioneering family trying to live and love each other under often impossible conditions. Lyman Ward, confined to a wheelchair, is a historian researching his grandmother's life in the West, mostly through his own need. Since he doesn't have detailed documents about every conversation, much of the book is conjecture, what he thought was said or what happened. Lyman's own spin is as interesting as the concrete documents, the letters from this not high-born but high-minded Eastern woman tied by love and convention to her simpler, earthy man, letters sent east to her skeptical best friend. Susan and Oliver Ward are all over the West, from California to Mexico to Idaho, chasing Oliver's dreams that never quite pan out. In the present, Lyman Ward is going through his own difficulties, and his research and writing tells him something about himself. Much of the book is masterful. The descriptions of the West are loving and the writing evocative. That said, the book is too long; you could lop off 80 pages with little problem, and some sections, "The Canyon" and the early part of "The Mesa", for instance, drag. Frankly, I think there should have been more about Lyman in the here and now; the extended passages about him that close the book we don't seem as well prepared for as we should have. These are minor quibbles, though. "Angle of Repose", though not truly an adventure tale, has an adventurous spirit, and would get a near-great 4.5 stars if allowed. When it was over, I found myself more moved than I expected to be, and the characters stayed with me long after I was finished reading.</span>

                    <span>Stegner's Angle of Repose is a perfect Christmas holiday read. Its slow, rich, weighty style and content are so enjoyable that you'll want to curl up and live with this landscape and these characters for a while. <P>However, it's not a book to be read on your lunch break. The book's slowness and richness don't allow for a skimming read. To fully appreciate this book, you'll need a cup of tea, a wool blanket, and hours to be absorbed into Stegner's fictional world.<P>The retired historian, who narrates the book, tells us a story of his grandparents' role in developing the Western frontier, but as he tells this story his own story (perhaps even more intricate and engaging) emerges. <P>The title comes from a geological/engineering term which means: "the steepest angle at which loose material remains intact without sliding downslope." This is very fitting, since the reader gets the feeling that the narrator is at his angle of repose, and he may at any moment be pushed by life that extra bit that causes him to fall into separate avalanching pieces.<P>"Read this book, but give it the room it requires," is my advice. Otherwise you may find yourself thinking of it as too slow instead of perfectly paced.</span>

                    <span>A retired professor, confined to a wheelchair in his family home in northern California, collects notes to write his grandmother's life story and ends up telling his own. <P>There is no raucous action, no grand finale, no hysterical laughter. The book's strength comes not from the plot but from the way the words are set out. Many characters float in and out of this exploration of life in the West but it is Lyman Ward, the modern narrator, whose tale binds the entire work. And Lyman Ward is dying. Having sensed tragedy on several levels and enraptured by the language, I was in no hurry to finish Angle of Repose. <P>At times I put the book down, uninterested in finding out how the characters' often miserable lives turned out. The ending is a blur. But all of those reservations are overshadowed by detailed recollections of life in the mining towns of New Almaden, Colorado, Idaho, and Grass Valley, and stunning descriptions of desolation, heartbreak, love, and trust. I loved how the story shifted from then to "now" and back again, sometimes leaving you wondering about time and space for a page or two. I grew up around many of the places Stegner includes in the book and I am grateful for his descriptions of life before the shopping centers, highways, and relatively easy living came to strip away the raw nature and risk involved in living there. Controversy surrounding Stegner's un-acknowledged use of the Foote letters as basis for Susan Ward's writings does not detract from the best parts of the book (and there are so many of them). His writing is rich and luscious beyond (my) words. Even if you don't finish it, read some of this book and revel in the phrasing.</span>
