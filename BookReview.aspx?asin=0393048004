                <span id="Label1">A fresh perspective on the Third Reich: the deadly contests among Hitler's lieutenants, and their disastrous consequences.  <P>The Nazi regime was essentially a religious cult relying on the hypnotic personality of Adolf Hitler, and it was fated to die with him. But while it lasted, his closest lieutenants competed ferociously for power and position as his chosen successor. This peculiar leadership dynamic resulted in millions of deaths and some of the worst excesses of World War II.  <P><I>The Devil's Disciples</I> is the first major book for a general readership to examine those lieutenants, not only as individuals but also as a group. It focuses on the three most important Nazi paladins&#151;G&#246;ring, Goebbels, and Himmler&#151;with their nearest rivals&#151;Bormann, Speer, and Ribbentrop&#151;in close attendance.  <P>Perceptive, illuminating, and grandly ambitious, <I>The Devil's Disciples</I> is above all a powerful chronological narrative, showing how the personalities of Hitler's inner circle developed and how their jealousies and constant intrigues affected the regime, the war, and Hitler himself. 16 pages of photographs.</span>

                    <span>Nazi Germany and the administration behind is it as become, in the popular lexicon, absolutely synonymous with evil. Rightly so, but I often feel that this casual characterization of the whole enterprise frustrates more scholarly examinations. If we just paint the whole regime with that wide, all inclusive brush, don't we suffer in the long run? Why were these men evil, what was the structure that existed that allowed them to wield such power and accomplish such horrific things? If we just say evil, then nothing is learned. Recent histories of the Third Reich and its leading members have been very good, but the best I have read in the last few years is without a doubt Anthony Read's The Devil's Disciples. To me, this is a really monumental work, on par with Kershaw's double biography of Hitler. While other books just lump all the leaders together, making them all interchangeably horrid, Read follows each individual throughout the history of the Third Reich, picking up on their many private motivations and their characteristic insecurities.<P>Most of those that became the real heavyweights behind Nazi Germany followed Hitler early on. Joseph Goebbels, a struggling writer and intellectual, was drawn to the socialist bent of Hitler's message. Hermann Goering, a decorated World War I ace was attracted to Hitler's virulent opposition to the Versailles Treaty and all of the anti-military ills of the Weimar Republic. Heinrich Himmler, an amateur farmer who dreamed of mythic military glory and loved Hitler's paramilitary infrastructure. All of this men, fairly intelligent, were totally won over by Hitler's legendary hypnotic speaking style. They became his closest political allies early on, especially Goebbels, who helped construct the Nazi political campaigns of the late 20's and early 30's. Even in the face of adversity, such as the failure of the Beer Hall putsch, they were steadfast in their allegiance to the Fuhrer, especially Goebbels, who is sickening in his willingness to compromise everything he believes in in order to appease Hitler. These men became all the more dangerous as the Nazi's insidiously gained control of Germany in 1933.<P>As the Nazi's began to take over every facet of life in Nazi Germany, those closest to Hitler began to fill niches in the dictatorship. Goebbels eventually became propaganda minister, Goering the Luftwaffe and the new economic programs, and Himmler started with the small SS. Other equally repulsive thugs took positions, such as Hess, Heydrich, and Rohm. The Nazi government was one characterized by incessant back biting and powerplays, as Hitler's removed leadership style fostered brutal political infighting. To move ahead, coalitions would destroy a common enemy, such as the SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives. As the Reich began to expand into Austria and Czechoslavakia, Hitler's captains ruthlessly began to wield their own influence overseas. Goering soon became the most powerful business magnate in Europe, pillaging whole nations, a blueprint that was about to be horrifically exported. New figures emerged, such as Ribbentrop and Speer, all of whom were strangely dedicated to being close to their god like leader. One way to do this was to step up the amount of anti-Semitic violence, a task in which the fanatics such as Himmler reveled.<P>Once the war started, the system of death and economic devastation was brought to the conquered lands of Europe. The most horrifying part of the book to me was the absolute nonchalance the Nazi hierarchy showed while ordering the deaths of millions upon millions of people. The empire was built on death, and people like Himmler were determined to mold it into a terrifying new order. Their philosophy was fiendishly selfish, with no concern for morality or temperance. As the war began to turn against them, the minions of the Reich accelerated their squabbling, fighting over the crumbling pieces of the Nazi empire. As Hitler degenerated into madness, they grew bolder in their initiatives, including the Final Solution. The most satisfying part of the book was to read the last days of these wretched individuals, who, in their unbelievably delusional minds, felt they would play some role in post war Germany. Most of them died like the cowards they were.<P>The book is just excellent. It is rich in detail at 900+ pages, but it flows and has an intense narrative. Read really knows how to write effectively, constantly informing but never boring. His profiles of the various Nazi leaders are amazingly engaging, you don't forget their origins as you read their various exploits. While there are really no new explanations, you still learn some new viewpoints on various actions and events that occurred during the Nazi regime. It is an eminently readable and entertaining account of mankind's darkest hour.</span>

                    <span>this is the best account of the inner day to day machinations of hitler's rise to power yet! wm. shirer left so much out! its fascinatingly told and once started you wont wanna put it down! its not for the faint of heart as every single detail is enclosed. Read has taken the diaries of all the major characters and placed the most significant details in an almost chronological order! i am only half way through and they haven't started the invasion of Poland yet! it does tend to concentrate on the main characters and the important decisions they made that lead to what happened. Read uses a lot of German names of places that can be confusing. a glossary would have been helpful. it will rate with Shirer's accounts of the third reich for centuies to come!</span>

                    <span>Anthony Read has written a wonderful book on a horrible tyrrany. Read traces the rise of Nazism from its infamous beginnings in post World WarI Germany to the fall of the Third Recih and the trial of the Nazi Criminals at Nuremburg.<BR> Read focuses on the three men closest to Hitler in the rise<BR>to power. Herman Goring the master of the Lutfwaffe; Joseph Goebbels the Mephistopheles of the Ministry of Propaganda and<BR>the chicken farmer turned mass murderer and leader of the SS<BR>Henreich Himmler.<P> The book is lengthy with over 900 pages filled with excellent thumbnail sketches of the personalities who together made Germany a prison for anyone who wishes to think for themselves and live in a climate of religious toleration.<BR> Anyone who teaches the history of the Third Reich should use this book. The only caveat is its lack of maps and detailed notes in the bibliography.<BR> Read kept my attention throughout this worthwhile tour through the Dantian hell of Hitlerian Germany.<BR> The book is a tour de force and worthy of praise!</span>

                    <span>Hitler was the evil genius of the rise of Nazism in post-World War I Germany. Everyone knows his name but few know how he rose to power using fiendish guile, deceit, trickery, thuggery and<BR>Antisemtic hatred to rise from the streets of Vienna to his<BR>ghoulish death in a Berlin bunker in 1945.<BR> In this 900 page popular history of the rise and fall of Nazism the British historian Anthony Read tells the story of<BR>Nazism by tracking the career of Hitler's evil trinity of<BR>Herman Goring, Dr. J. Goebbels and Himmler the sadistic and<BR>cruel head of the SS.<BR> As one who has read countless books on the Nazi era I would place this easy to read and understand book as one of the best.<BR>It is a cautionary tale of how intelligent men and amoral bounders can alike be seduced by the siren call of a dictator<BR>such as Hitler.<BR> The one problem I have with the work is the lack of maps.<BR>This book doesn't have anything new to say about the era for scholars but as a digestible history of the times it is outstanding.<BR> I have enjoyed Read's work in the past and hope this latest volume will do well in the United States. The evil of Nazism and the hatred between the races must never be forgotten in our historical consciousness.<BR> Well recommended!</span>
