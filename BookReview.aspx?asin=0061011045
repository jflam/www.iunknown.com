                    <span>This book is not worth reading unlesss someone is paying you to read it, and paying you very well.  Even if you find this book lying on the street do not wast your time.<br>Well the story a Neurotic with illusions of granduer who wants to be James Bond inflitrates the Hell's Angels and then a hack writer who does not knew how to tell a coherent story attempts to make him a hero.</span>

                    <span>First, I don't normally write, but as a biker with a voracious appetite for all things literary I felt a need to express my opinion about this book. DON'T BUY !<br> I have never read a book whose storyline was so erratic. The timeline bounced so bad that I was never sure what year I was in. This book was written as if the author was dictating to a tape recorder random thoughts while on the run from the HA and then published without proofreading.<br> This is the second book read from this author with similar results so I have learned my lesson. If readers desire readings about the Hells Angels, there are quite a few books that cover the subject properly from both sides of the fence.Even Sonny Barger expresses his story better than Yves Lavigne and I believe his expertise is in other areas.<br> To sum this up, Yves Lavigne writes the way Hunter S. Thompson talks.Maybe the literary police will arrest Yves before the Hells Angels find him.</span>

                    <span>This book was a little slow to start, but if you are at all interested in the history of the hells angels it becomes very interesting. It had a lot of interesting facts about the biker club.</span>

                    <span>This doesn't deserve to be called "Biker Trash"  that's almost a term of endearment to us. <p>I give this author 1 Star for managing to have another book published!  He is absolutely the worst writer I have ever read.  Grammer, prose, language, not to mention information context just wrong, verbose, overbearing and pure fantasy!  If however, you enjoy prolific filthy language, hey, this is the guy!<p>As usual, he bounces from one club to another, one chapter to another, dropping names, talking a great deal of "poetic license" in filling in the blanks to create his stories.  Talks about his relations with insider informants, names club members, the main members anyone might know. <p>He still harps on all women associated with the clubs as sex slaves and prostitutes and other selected adjectives. There are a those stupid girls out there.  I guarantee you, I may be a 1% VP's wife, but if ANY man dared to touch a hair on my head, do I need finish. And that goes for any other wife I know. <p>The first lousy book (Three can keep a secret if 2 are dead) seemed to focus on murders and drugs in Canada with the HA's then jumped to outlining other clubs and back to HA's.  I am curious as to how any of his info might be substantiated.    <p>If you are looking for that sort of truth, the only place you will find it is on the inside, no matter what you read, who you talk to, or who you think you know.  News is always more sensational than the truth.  Everyone that wears a badge isn't a good guy.  And every Biker with a beard and log hair on a Harley IS NOT a bad guy.  <p>Try Sonny's book, doensn't give a lot of detail's of the HA operations or organization and it doesn't have to. Respect that it exists whether you like it or not.  We can agree to disagree</span>
