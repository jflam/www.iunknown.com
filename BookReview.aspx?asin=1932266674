<br />
<br />this is a valuable title and worth the wait!</span>

                    <span>This book upset me.  Not really the book itself, that's great, but what it implies: that this type of exploit hasn't gone away.  I thought things were getting better, but the author explains that is an illusion: it's just that the reporting slacked off.  
<br />
<br />It is hard to believe that programmers keep making the same mistakes over and over again.  This book shows what those mistakes are and how hackers exploit them.  You need a good understanding of assembly language to get much out of this, but if you do have that background, this is a real eye-opener.
<br />
<br />Extremely detailed, and some of this is a bit of a reach for me (it's been many a year since I did any C or Assembler), but it is fascinating, though in the same sense that watching a tiger stalk you would be: it's scary.
<br />
<br />Certainly recommended for people who are writing code today, and I hope more of them pay attention, though the authors attitude seems to be that these problems will continue to plague us.</span>

                    <span>Typically, a text on computing might give a cursory few pages (if even that!) on explaining what buffer overflow attacks are. This book takes a far more detailed look. It emphasises the writing of assembler. Which may put you, the interested reader, in a minority amongst programmers. Most of whom never write assembler.
<br />
<br />The book teaches the writing and testing of shellcode. Very hands on. You learn to go back and forth between C source and its assembler equivalent, and how to use these when trying to induce stack overflows or attacking format strings, for example. Gritty and practical exposure. Analogous to working on a car engine. You have to get your hands dirty.
<br />
<br />Most of the book's examples cover the Intel assembly language and the Microsoft operating systems. The book explains that this is certainly not because these are inherently riskier than alternatives. But a pragmatic reflection of Microsoft's and Intel's market dominance, which attracts attackers. For balance, examples are also shown of attacks against linux and HPUX.</span>
