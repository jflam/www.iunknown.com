                <span id="Label1">The companion to the Oscar(r)-nominated film, Winged Migration is the definitive visual account of its subject: the extraordinary flights of migrating birds around the world. Migration is an enigma. Who knows why the cuckoo, born in Europe, flies alone to the far forests of Africa, home of its ancestors? Or how the Arctic tern can fly over ten thousand miles on its astonishing journey from pole to pole? Winged Migration follows single birds and whole squadrons on their restless flights seeking answers to such riddles. The result is a tour de force that is testament to the patience of a globe-trotting team of filmmakers and ornithologists. With its informative text, Winged Migration offers both the general reader and the dedicated bird watcher a bird's-eye view of five continents and a grand, yet intimate, portrait of the secret life of birds.</span>

                    <span>This book is perfect for a school project. It contains full color<BR>pictures of birds in the natural environment. There are pictures<BR>of the Guacharos of the Andes, the Snowy Owl and many other<BR>denominations on every continent including Antartica. The<BR>presentations are larger than life depictions of nature.<BR>Birds are shown in the migratory state; wherein, it is not<BR>unusual to travel beyond 10,000 miles to a final destination.<BR>The volume is well worth the price charged. This would make a great gift for the student in your house. The pictures are<BR>on par with the National Geographic Magazine presentations<BR>of birds in their natural habitat.</span>

                    <span>My interest for this book was sparked by my having seen the video of the same name. The book, however, goes beyond the video in that it identifies specifically "the players" -gives descriptions of them, their migratory patterns, their habits and habitats, as well as explaining by example the filming of the movie. If you have not seen the video, it will open a whole new world of bird migration to you. The migrations will become, to the reader, so important, majestic, and exciting in and of themselves. The premise, very simply, is that birds migrate to survive. The book will take the reader beyond his own responsibilities of commuting to work every day; it will reaffirm for the naturalists the necessity of living each day within an already pre-established harmony ; it will move any reader to higher levels of tolerance and compassion as, with its reading, one feels with absolute and great starkness how we all fit together on this planet. The book is truly an uplifting masterpiece. And it is magnificently photographed and presented. As long as birds are migrating, this book will be timelessly and repeatedly appreciated for its, as well, as the birds', utter beauty.</span>
