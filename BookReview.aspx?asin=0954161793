                    <span>The clear and concise writing style makes GCC easy to understand for anyone.  Those new to compilation with GCC and friends should start here.  I wish I had an introduction like this when I was getting started.  It could have save me a lot of research and confusion.  
<br />
<br />Most readers will move through the 87 pages comfortably.  Gough explains the basics skipped by others.  Goug's writing in concise and crystal clear.  Each chapter has a couple of simple examples that really get the concepts across.  Even someone who types slowly could get through this text and all the examples with ease.  Those who choose this book will be rewarded with a clear understanding of GCC basics.  Other commands covered include g++, ar, as, nm, file, ldd, ld, gcov, gprof, and cpp.  Topics include compiling C compilation options, preprocessor, debugging, optimizing, C++, platform specific options, related tools, and troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />I say four stars, because I'm going to need more detail on some things.  However, this book is probably sufficient for many.  The writing is great and the price is right.  I'd buy it again.

                    <span>You might choose to regard this book by Gough as a natural complement to Stallman's 'Using GCC: The GNU Compiler Collection Reference Manual for GCC 3.3.1'. As you may know, Stallman wrote the original gcc. Gough pitches his book at a new user of gcc, or, for that matter, for a programmer new to C itself. Whereas the aforementioned book by Stallman is for experienced users.  
<br />
<br />Gough writes concisely. You should be able to quickly absorb the entire contents of the book. During which, learning about how to use gcc with various libraries and header files might also prove instructive in laying out a program, to be scattered across various *.c and *.h files.  For those of you who strongly support the concept of open source code, there is the extra incentive that royalties from this book will go to those ends.      </span>
