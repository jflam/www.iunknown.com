                    <span>I have ordered this book for my college English classes for the past four years. Each time I browse through it I find something new, something valuable. I do indeed keep a copy in my car's glovebox. I pull it out if I find myself stuck somewhere and I read a poem or two.<BR>The selections are indeed eclectic and span the globe. They are loosely arranged by theme and my international students assure me that the translations are good and truly reflect the spirit of the originals.<BR>I recommend this highly to people who love poetry and to those who think they might someday at least like it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>My confidence in this personal and somewhat quirky collection was undermined when I turned to W.S. Merwin's lovely and powerful "For the Anniversary of My Death," (which begins "Every year without knowing it I have passed the day/ When the last fires will wave to me")and saw to my dismay that it had a typo in the last line, changing "bowing" to "boding" and thereby wrecking the poem. Unfortunate oversight. Neruda and other South Americans are noticeable by their absence, begging the question of whether Milosz harbors a grudge.</span>

                    <span>This is a nice eclectic collection of poems from around the world. The poems have been organized into rather unique categories. The book is different from many poetry anthologies in that the poems are diverse and inspiring, and they are arranged in a pleasing nonstandard manner.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The poetry in this diverse volume lives up to the lofty title on the book cover. Indeed, the poetry therein is luminous. From Haiku and dead moths to drangonfly wings and Jeffers' hurt hawks, this anthology is great for any ocassion. I discovered it while traveling, and it proved a lovely travel companion. It made the trip especially memorable and much more endurable, in that the poetry unceasingly provided me opportunity to reflect on the human condition and elemental themes. The more interesting aspect of this anthology happens to accord with the editor's own writing philosophy--which focuses on celebrating the ordinary--to demonstrate that the world is imbued with poetic spirit in simple facts--simple happenings that may easily be overlooked by the distracted passerby. I recommend this volume to anyone, esp. the contributions of Herbert, Hass, Milosz, Jeffers, and Szymborska.</span>
