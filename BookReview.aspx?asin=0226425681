                    <span>Martin Buber once wrote that in every animal function human beings are not simply as animals, but instead humanize what they do. In "The Hungry Soul' Leon Kass gives a phenomenological and philosophical basis to the thesis that in eating we can also perfect our nature. Kass is not simply one of the world's senior bioethicists, but a humanist scholar with a medical and scientific background that give his arguments  a force in fact and reason. I cannot honestly say I followed the argument of this work throughout but I did understand through it how eating can become a central means of extending our own caring for, and relation to other human beings, a way then of sanctifying ourselves in the world.
<br />I conclude with an illuminating paragraph from Kass' conclusion, a paragraph which I believe gives the true ' flavor ' of the book.
<br /> "In the higher animals., the soul energized by hunger gains hunger's satisfaction only through intermediate activities- such as smelling, hearing, seeing, chasing, attacking, capturing, biting, tasting, chewing , and swallowing- activities which themselves become new objects for the hungry soul. Increasingly capable of genuine encounters with the world, with other living forms, and ( especially in birds and mammals) with kith and kin,the souls of the hungry acquire new hungers of their own,and for more nourishment.With the rise of intelligence and especially with the extraordinary development of the upright animal, the hungry soul seeks satisfacgtion in activities animated also by wonder,ambition,affection, curiosity, and awe. We human beings delight in beauty and order, art and action, sociability and friendship, insight and understanding, song and worship. And as self-conscious beings, we especially crave self-understanding and knowledge of our place in the larger whole." pp.  228</span>

                    <span>This book makes a strong defense of the classical principles of truth, beauty and goodness, jumping from a provoking and very unique starting point: eating.  Kass is able to bring the perennial philosophy into the 20th Century, and to create a dialogue between it and modern science, as well as provide a persuasive understanding and defense of traditional ethics, etiquette, and beauty.  Kass's analysis of "Babette's Feast" and his speculations on religous ritual are very thought provoking.<p>One must admire Kass's attempt to pull together so much of traditional philosophy (especially Aristotle) and literature, and still bring this into dialogue with contemporary science (there's reductionism there if anywhere) and culture.  His scope is broad, and this book demands a lot of the reader! The argument is purposive, and analysis is difficult--there is so much there, and just about every move is key.  (I found summarizing for students very difficult.) Yet Kass's arguments are very much worth considering, and bear more than one reading.  To those who are patient, a vision of a very different way of looking at our whole human experience will emerge, one that I believe makes better sense of ourselves than most others offered today.</span>

                    <span>One of the reviewers seems to be very upset by Kass's omission of Freud and Levi-Strauss. There is a distinct difference between an academic study and a work of philosophy. The Hungry Soul is not an academic study and should not be expected to quote any specific opinion or previous work. This book represents Kass's own views on the subject and in my opnion they are thoughtful, deep and of a very high ethical character. This book is inspirational and thought provoking.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>One reviewer described this book as "reductionary humanism." I think that is a fitting description. The problem is that Kass ignores Freud and Levi-Strauss, for instance, despite the fact that both, it could be  argued, thought about nothing but eating. "Identification" and  the "death drive" are, after all, the psychological analogs of  swallowing and defecating. Levi-Strauss devoted thousands of pages to the  table manners and the rest, but Kass doesn't bother to cite him once.  And  if he really wanted to treat the hunger in the soul, what about the eating  disorder's, bulimia and anorexia and the rest. Kass takes a little too  seriously Leo Strauss's injunction that is better to understand the low in  terms of the high--he also liked to quote Hegel to the effect that  philosophy should not be edifying.</span>

                    <span>This is a book about the nature of human beings and ideas that would not have occurred to you otherwise. It is provocative--try to find some satisfying reply to Kass's contention that organ donation is a form of cannalbalism. The writing is fine.I can't recommend giving this book to everyone, but if you have some intellectually-minded friends who love to eat, this would be a tremendous choice. You could then discuss it over a omniverous meal.</span>
