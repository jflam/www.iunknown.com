                    <span>ACT6! for Dummies is not only extremely informative, it is fun and easy to read. It is a great starting place to learn the many aspects of the program and it is a great reference once you are using the program regularly. If you can figure out how to use this program to its fullest by using the book supplied by ACT, you are probably not in sales, you have a lot of extra time on your hands, and you love to watch paint dry. Unless you are selling real estate in South Florida and one of my competitors, buy ACT6! for Dummies and get yourself on track fast.</span>

                    <span>I'm not a computer buff so I bought this book and was gratefully taken through an overview of the basics of Act! 6 and then the details. It not only showed how to use Act! 6, but also how to maximize the use of Act! 6. <P>The important thing about the book is that it is written for the reader (not in tech-speak), with a wonderful sense of humor. In fact, it's as if the author is right there with you as you go through and learn/use the program. After having used Act! 6 for a while, if I have more sophisticated needs, I look them up in the book and have the answer quickly and painlessly. <P>I hesitated buying Act! 6 for a while, but once I bought the program, I also bought this book. Now I am a confident and effective user.</span>

                    <span>As one of the leading ACT! trainers in the United States, I know what it takes to really teach people the program. And this book has it all. It's clear and concise, and the features are laid out in a logical fashion for incremental learning. The graphics are perfect references to the written text, and readers will have no trouble following along as they learn the features of the program. The author uses plain, descriptive language and doesn't get bogged down in "tech talk." If you want to learn ACT! on your own, this is the book for you!</span>

                    <span>Karen's book is the best ACT! 6.0 book on the market. It's well written, full of tips & tricks, and funny. A lot of the 'funny' books out there tend to be sarcastic, but Karen incorporates humor into her book without crossing the line into sarcasm. The result is a great book that will show you how to get up and running with ACT! and get the most out of the product. I urge everyone to buy this book!<P>I'm an ACT! Certified Consultant and ACT! Premier Trainer and run the 4th largest ACT! reselling outfit in North America. I'm a contributing editor for the ACT! magazine, and I've written 23 course manuals 100 articles on ACT! and related issues.</span>

                    <span>The purpose here is to review the book and not the software. However, I would like to suggest that with an attitude like that, no wonder tech support was rude. And, one wonders why 6 million users have successfully used ACT! over the last 15 years. I considered myself to have a high degree of expertise, yet I found the book to be invaluable.</span>
