                    <span>This is a comprehensive book encompassing not just the basics of MP3 both other useful information as well. The book is for all levels knowledge; from novice digital music lovers to musicians. <P>Although the author only briefly describes the theory behind sound and digital sound recording, he does a great job of explaining all the digital audio compression terms and other technical buzzwords such as ripping, encoding, Codecs, MIDI, WAV files, WinAmp as well as other terms. After discussing just what an MP3 is and how to use it, the author shows you how to turn you PC into a MP3 based digital work station.<P>Going beyond just describing MP3s, the author also shows you how to set up your home stereo system to play MP3s off of the computer or off of a CD that you just made. He also shows you how to play MP3 files off of the web or how to web cast your music play list. The final chapters are for musicians with some excellent real life stories from several musicians. The author even includes brief discussion on how musician can record, mix, master, distribute and promote their work. All in all a good and comprehensive read that is not too technical (it is a "dummies" book).</span>

                    <span>The Dummies Guides can be a mixed bag, but this one is very clear and informative. I especially liked the chapters on recording one's own MP3 files, something that some of the other books don't cover in as much detail. Great intro, with enough 'meat' to keep you going for quite a little while.</span>
