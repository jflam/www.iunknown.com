                    <span>Neither this movie, nor the play it was created from were
<br />directly based on true events.  The work is loosely based on
<br />events in the life of boxer Jack Johnson.  But major portions
<br />of the story diverge greatly from the story of the real man.
<br />Thats not a bad thing in that movie tells a compelling story
<br />by changing the facts, but the side-effect is that it distorts
<br />the history of the real man.
<br />
<br />The film gives a really distorted picture of the life of a boxer
<br />in that era.  The typical boxer was a drunk surrounded by
<br />hangers-on, prostitutes and women attracted by money and 
<br />celebrity.  It wasn't really any sort of world of romance and
<br />deep love as shown in the film.  It was about greed, violence
<br />and the "rewards" (the women) of being a champion.
<br />
<br />Where the movie misses the point totally is in not understanding
<br />that root problem wasn't just racism, but a business and media
<br />culture who were totally willing to use racism and racial
<br />conflict as a way to sell tickets and newspapers.  Jack Johnson
<br />(and the search for the great white hope) was a godsend for
<br />the boxing establishment.  By combining racial conflict
<br />with sports, interest in boxing and newspaper coverage of
<br />boxing went way up.  It was never how he was openly living
<br />that was the problem (even in 1910), it was the decision of
<br />the newspapers to focus in on how he was living.  
<br />
<br />Also, despite all the outrage and the ill-treatment of Jack 
<br />Johnson, he kept both the title and his freedom until age
<br />(not racism) caught up with him.  The film spreads the old
<br />lie that the fight in Cuba was thrown.  It was not.  He lost
<br />because he was old and his lifestyle (like all boxers of that
<br />era) had caught up to him.
<br />
<br />The acting in the film is first-rate, but the story doesn't
<br />hold up.  Its a 1960's era political film that makes valid
<br />points about racism and hypocracy of that time.  But these 
<br />days, the issues at hand are atheletes who are either made
<br />into saints or devils at the whim of a few reporters.
<br />All to sell papers or get viewers.  While the reality of these
<br />mens lives isn't reported at all.</span>

                    <span>I can't say enough about this great film, which is obviously woefully underappreciated, since it's currently not available on video at all.  James Earl Jones is mesmerizing, the script and direction are impeccable--yet another great movie from Martin Ritt.  So many of the scenes are unlike anything I've seen before in the brutal frankness the filmmakers use to portray race relations circa 1910.</span>

                    <span>This is a remarkable and forceful film, well written and directed.  Jones shows a physical prowess that does not come through in any other film I have seen him in and carries the role with a natural grace.  Sharply exposing the prejudice of the time, it is also unfliching in the portrait of a man brought to ruin by the forces around him, with not a little assistance from his own feeling of being untouchable.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>this Movie for it's time frame was Ground-Breaking.in 1971 to be doing a Movie with a Black Actor&White Female Lead was Big.well sorry to say it still is in 2001.James Earl Jones was Good as Jack Johnson.but I'd dig a New up-dated take on it.anyway The Soundtrack was a Knock-Out.Miles Davis&His Band went the full 15 Rounds.this Film has a Cool Pace&isn't like many other films for that Reason alone.It's History seldom mentioned.</span>

                    <span>I saw this movie when it first came out in the theatres in 1970. It may not be quite as powerful today as it was then, but it is definitely worth seeing for the performances by Jones and Alexander, two of the finest  actors in America.</span>
