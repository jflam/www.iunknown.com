                    <span>Elizabeth Moran and Master Joseph Yu did a wonderful job in writing  "The Complete Idiot's Guide to The I Ching".  Yijing is a powerful divination tool in traditional Chinese culture.  It has been intriguing and difficult to understand thoroughly.  This book is well organized in explaining from the historical background to tts modern day application, as well as how to utilize the knowledge further to open our mind and improve our life. It is thoroughly enjoyable reading. Thank you for a job well done. </span>

                    <span>Usually, the "Complete Idiot's" and "Dummies" books give you the basic information on their subject, with some depth, but nothing too encompassing.  I was very surprised with this book -- it gives in-depth information about the I Ching and its history, as well as touching upon other things like synchronicity.  The translation of the I Ching included in the book is also rather well done, and better than some stand-alone translations (for example, "The Taoist I Ching").  I learned a lot about the I Ching from this book.  Recommended.</span>

                    <span>While new to I Ching, I find myself fortunate to find this work.  It brings a structured simplicity with comprehensiveness that is essential in order to give the I Ching veracity and approachability.  Excellent.</span>

                    <span>For the past 25 or so years I have been failing to make head nor tail of the Yi Jing. My studies suggested and my intuition told me, that there was something very significant to be found there but the text, though it seemed to provide many glimpses of relevance and truth, always slipped back into obscure regions peopled only by erudite sinologists... and where these luminaries sometimes seem to have slight differences of criterion (the things Mr Cleary says about R.Wilhelm!).<br>There was nothing for it but to declare myself a Complete Idiot  - something which had been staring me in the face for longer than I like to think - and this very Daoist act of auto-abasement was rewarded by a version of the Yi Jing, or rather the Zhouyi (its wings having been usefully clipped of Confucian confusion) which at last made sense. Sense not only for the clarity of the translation (or transliteration or whatever) but by the meaning and coherence of the text.<br>The sensation is rather like having a plaster removed from a broken limb.<br>I would like to recommend the book to anyone who wants a clear, manageable and simple (but not simplistic) version of the background to and wisdom of this classic.<br>Five Stars! Bravo! and Many Thanks to Ms Moran and Master Yu!</span>

                    <span>At Last! A reliable & supremely useable guide to this ancient art & science from two of the best known authorities in related fields [Classical Feng Shui]. When a couple of true heavy hitters put their all into a book like this it becomes an invaluable manual that-- like their other works-- is highly practical and easily put to use. Pronounced "E"-Jing, Nobel prize winner Neils Bohr discovered in 1945 that the I Ching was binary code for--<br>you guessed it-- Quantum Theory.                                 I don't mind recommending the book to anyone at the bargain prices that the Idiot's Guide softbounds go for -- in fact, we<br>have regularly recommended their first book here in the Twin Cities on our cable show-- All About Feng Shui for Home & Office.</span>
