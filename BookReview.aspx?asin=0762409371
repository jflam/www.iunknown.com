                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a MUST-READ for any fan of video games who grew up tossing quarters into games like: Donkey Kong, Centipede, and Defender. Mr. Sellers does a great job of giving the early history of video games and then hitting the mainstay games from 1977-1984. The color pictures are great reminders of these games from yesterday, and there's plenty of surprises too!<P>One of the books strong points is that Sellers is obviously a huge fan of video games, both arcade and home. Anyone who can mention "Tunnels of Doom" (the best TI-99 game ever) is definately in "the know". The book has plenty of fun pages that include topics like: Bizarre Games, What were they thinking?, and bad sequels to games. Trust me, if you remember games like PENGO and POOYAN then you'll want to read this book.<P>The only weak part of the book is the fact that if you have a strong memory for the mainstay games, then you may not learn much more. There's not lots of insider information, just a brief synopsis and overview of the game topic and play. I was hoping for a bit more in depth research on facts that the normal joe may not have known.<P>All-in-all this is an excellent read. I hope Mr. Sellers tackles the later years of arcade gaming (Rolling Thunder, Double Dragon, Tekken) and maybe even looks at the history of homegaming...Commodore 64 anyone? So the next time you need a break from all your X-boxing or Gamecubing, pull out this book and treat your eyes and brain to a different treat!</span>

                    <span>I went into this book thinking to myself "it's just a coffee table book with some fun facts in it" but after reading it I found it to be full of fond memories of my video game induced youth. It does contain some fun facts but it iis in color and this book displays some of the games that I remember spending my entire allowance on [Burgertime, Tapper, and Donkey Kong Junior]. Just about any arcade game that that was a part of your life from the 80's is in here and if you are into video games you will find yourself reading more and more to find out more about the other video games that you might have missed while you were too busy pumping quarters in your local Pac-Man machine. This book is not really in depth but it is a good read and a great way to kill some time. My only complaint is that I wish that Mr. Sellers had included some more of those great 80's games that stole my quarters [Bump n' Jump and Night Driver were not featured while games like Death Race I and II and Chiller only got mentioned for their violence]. Other than that, if you loved to spend your time at the arcade, whether you were a child, teen, or adult, Mr. Sellers book is worth the price for the memories alone.</span>

                    <span>This book is OK, but not very deep. It's a decent "period" piece for you nostalgia buffs. Indeed, I found myself thinking back to those days at Kentwood Arena, Funway Freeway, and Someplace Else; banging away on those controls while battling alien invaders and climbing skyscrapers (Crazy Climber). I didn't care much for the sidebars and sprinkling of useless personal trivia from the author, and some of his comments are a bit juvenile and unnecessary. You get the impression that the author was trying to have fun while putting this book together, but the "fun" gets irritating after a few pages. The interviews, while short, are decent, and the pictures of the games are nice.<P>This book is good for a quick trip back to those halcyon days of youth and Pac-Man, but don't expect any deep historical record. For that, you need to check out The Ultimate History Of Video Games by Steven Kent.</span>

                    <span>Arcade Fever is not a perfect book, but it's still quite good. A number of reviewers have taken the author to task for the book's shortcomings. Lighten up! It's a fun book about a fun topic. Don't be so serious, you'll get an ulcer.<P>First off, the book is subtitled: The Fan's Guide to the Golden Age of Video Games. As a "fan's guide" it works well - it's less a doctoral thesis in the field of Arcadeology than a simple overview of games the casual 1980s arcade visitor would know and likely love. If you want obscure references and arcane knowledge, this is definitely not your book.<P>Second, whenever I get together with my brother and sisters I revert to the maturity of a late teenager (my wife hates this). It seems that Sellers has reverted to that same level of maturity in his commentary, and probably for the same reason: It's fun to go back in time and try and relive our favorite moments. Cut the guy a break and get in on the fun. If you can read the word "poopy" without grinning, you're not ready for this book. If the Beavis and Butthead voice in your head says "he wrote 'poopy'...cool...heh heh eh heh," you're ready to dive right in. <P>Third, I like the year-by-year history snippets. It provides a context for what else we were doing when not playing the games. Was it necessary? No. Does "Who Shot J.R.?" have anything to do with video games? No. Does it help get you back in the mindset of The Golden Age? I think so.<P>Fourth, I like the mix of games in the book. There are games you loved, liked, and hated. There are the popular games and the sleepers. Are one or more of your favorites neglected? Probably (I'd have liked a page for Tailgunner or Omega Race, myself). I wish Sellers hadn't ragged on Bosconian (but I was an English major, so that's probably why I like it so much). I liked Cliff Hanger more than Dragon's Lair, but I can concede that DL deserves the full review, CH the snippet.<P>Finally, the sole purpose of a book like this is to kindle the feeling of nostalgia in its reader. I had forgotten some of the things in the book: some of the games, some of the trends - I had totally forgotten about putting quarters up on marquee lip to reserve the next game. I feel better for having remembered them. If you were born in the late-'60s/early-'70s, no longer live in your parents' basement, and enjoy a fun, light read, you'll probably like this book too.</span>

                    <span>Like Supercade, this collection doesn't bring much new to the table for the retrogame fan. Just seems like another attempt to cash in on our age brackets' nostalgia. Assembled within are a number of games from the golden age of arcades. The choices themselves are safe, and look like they could have been compiled easily from Videotopia or Mame32's Golden Age folder. The authors irreverent commentary has been touched upon by other reviewers; I also found it off putting and juvenile. Really the only thing going for this book were the cabinet shots. The screen snaps were once again ripped from Mame without much credit, but at least they weren't run through Photoshop with a failing art students eye like Van Burnham did in Supercade. Any factual information the author provided, beyond his own hackneyed description of gameplay, could easily be found in Mame's history.dat file. First Quarter by Kent is still a benchmark for these types of retrospect even though that book didn't necessarily concentrate solely on the arcade market. For those interested in retrogaming who may not already know: Mame32, the Win32 GUI version of Mame, at version .76 [4499 arcade games supported] seeks to preserve these games through emulation, it also facilitates the creation and collection of marquees, screen shots, control panels, cabinets, flyers, and historical information about designers, stories, etc. in one place. The program itself, as a living documentation project, far exceeds written efforts like this. Just google on Mame32 to find it.</span>
