                    <span>Oksendal develops stochastic integration, but only integration with respect to a Brownian Motion integrator, not with respect to local martingale integrators (e.g. The Ito process).  This presents a problem  because in his Finance section (and question 4.3) he wishes to integrate with respect to an Ito process, which is not neccessarily a Brownian Motion.  Based on the theory he has developed in the book, this is not justified!!</span>

                    <span>It's actually a very good book if you need to learn the topic quickly, armed with a good background in probability theory you will have no difficulty getting through the first 1/3 of the book and gain a working knowledge of SDEs, Ito calculus etc. IT is at times concise in the sense that it lacks motivation etc., but the exposition is such that this presents no major hurdles, as the proofs are clear and short, there are very few errors, except the ones mentioned by the reviewer below, which I should double-check again because I didn't really use this book for its feynman-kac formula (there are better books out there for that). An excellent feature of the book, for those wanting examples from physics and other applied fields, are the problems at the end of chapters. You should definitely give it a try, many of them present the necessary motivation (solutions are at the end of the book). Despite the criticism below, which I consider minor (i.e. it could easily be fixed in a subsequent edition), it is a standard textbook for SDEs, which many respectable mathematicians recommend. Books should be judged by how many times they are quoted by experts, and this book certainly has been cited many times.</span>

                    <span>His version of Kolmogorov backward equation(Theorem 8.1.1, p. 131) is just wrong. Of course, then his Feynman-Kac formula(Theorem 8.2.1, p. 135) is wrong as well. 
<br />The correct versions can be found in numerous other books, like 
<br />Karatzas and Shreve, Shreve II(2004), Gikhman and Skorokhod, and on and on.</span>

                    <span>If calculus is to real analysis then this book is an attempt at filling in _____ is to stochastic analysis. Stochastic analysis is a difficult topic and a simplified introduction with minimal prerequisites is a great goal. However, this book has not fullfilled its promise.
<br />
<br />There are a number of complaints to be made about this book. Most importantly is that in his attempt at simplification, Oksendal frequently chooses shedding (important) details over properly motivating a new concept. I found this particularly true in his exposition of generators. The book is poorly also organized: a number of topics are arbitrarily split into different chapters, important ideas hide inside of examples, etc.
<br />
<br />While this is not my favorite book by any means, there is currently no replacement for it. Jumping directly into a book like Karatzas&Shreeve can be daunting. I would recommend getting a used copy. Also, previous editions seem to be very nearly identical to the current edition.
<br />
<br />I also recommend checking out Rogers&Williams "Diffusions, Markov Process, and Martingales" Vols I&II.</span>

                    <span>When I became a quant, I needed to learn stochastic calculus and stochastic differential equations.  Luckily, I found this book, which covers a lot of difficult concepts in a rigorous but accessible way.  Oksendal is an excellent writer: his proofs are very clear (and usually not too terse), he provides very illustrative examples, and he does a great job of anticipating where the reader might get stuck.  In addition, the problems at the end of the chapters do a good job of reinforcing central theorems and ideas.  After reading this book, you'll be able to read most of the academic financial literature and all finance textbooks.<p>I've read lots of math books, and this is undoubtedly the best one I've ever seen.  The only necessary backround is a solid understanding of measure theory.</span>
