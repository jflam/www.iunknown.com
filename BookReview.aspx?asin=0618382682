                <span id="Label1">From the acclaimed author of Arresting God in Kathmandu, The Guru of Love is the engrossing story of a fevered love triangle set in contemporary Nepal. Ramchandra, a quiet math teacher, reluctantly enters into an adulterous relationship, and soon his double lives disastrously converge. When Goma, his wife by arranged marriage, learns of his affair, she demands that his mistress move into their small quarters. Unable to dissuade her, Ramchandra finds his desires and fears living side by side. Goma proves to be far shrewder than she seems, entering into a surprising alliance with his mistress. And Ramchandra finds himself trapped -- both in his house and in his city, Kathmandu, a crowded place where secrets are impossible to keep and family matters dictate. Ultimately, his only escape is to let go of someone he loves. Absorbing, sexy, and psychologically acute, The Guru of Love radiates compassion and rare insight.</span>

                    <span>Ramchandra, a schoolteacher, seems to be happily married; his dream is to one day buy a house for his family. To earn extra income, he tutors students on the side, but he constantly and unsuccessfully struggles to make ends meet, and he falls in love with one of his students. <P>While this is certainly familiar literary terrain, Samrat Upadahyay's debut novel is distinctive for its Kathmandu setting, social milieu, and religious elements. Featuring prose that is emotionally reserved and stylistically brusque, the book excels at portraying a middle-class protagonist, including his guilt whenever he spends money on frivolous luxuries, his remorse when he cheats on his wife, and the drudgery of his workaday world.<P>The same can't be said for the rest of the characters, who sometimes border on cardboard cutouts. There are the nasty in-laws, who regard Ramchandra as an inferior match for their daughter. There is his mistress, Maliti, whose motives are shallow and whose passions seem capricious. And there is Ramchandra's wife, Goma, a compassionate, suffering saint who overcomes her initial anger over the affair and resorts to a surprising solution to accommodate her husband's mistress. <P>Although Goma is certainly likeable (what saint isn't?), the author presents absolutely nothing in Goma's character or background that would make this aspect of the story even remotely believable. Much of this subplot struck me as fanciful, because its representation resembled a midlife fantasy instead of a midlife crisis. True--married men everywhere have affairs and their wives accept them back, but how many wives are so bizarrely tolerant of their husband's transgressions? <P>The novel is also strewn with passages relating the social and political upheaval in Nepal. The purpose of these passages, while informative, is never really clear. Upadhyay might be contrasting everyday personal travails with political and social disorder ("My personal problems are my country's problems," Ramchandra says at one point), but the comparison seems superficial and the disconnectedness of these episodes is often jarring.<P>Nevertheless, the book is never boring, and the depictions of the Dashain festival and religious rituals are captivating. Much, much more happens in the novel, and in many ways it redeems itself in the final chapters.</span>

                    <span>The Guru of Love is a terrific read. It is entertaining, engaging and well-written. The story concerns a middle-aged school teacher, Ramchandra, living in Katmandu. He has a wife he loves, two children and annoying in-laws who don't seem to like him that much. Ramchandra has middle class dreams of owning a house, but his realities keep him from that dream. To pick up some extra money, he tutors on the side. One of his tutees, Malati, is a young single mother with whom Ramchandra beomes a bit obsessed with. He begins an affair with her and ultimately, his wife finds out. His wife's behavior, while a little unconventional, makes for interesting reading. Ramchandra is not the most sympathetic of protagonists, but he is all to human and most readers will see bits of themselves in him, if not in his actions. The final resolutions of various parts of the novel (why Ramchandra's wife married him in the first place, what happens to Malati) are particularly satisfying. Not neat, tidy endings, but an excellent, and a bit amusing, ending. Enjoy this well-written novel.</span>

                    <span>Despite an uncreative plot, Upadhyay's "The Guru of Love" is an enjoyable book. The story centers around a married character named Ramchandra who finds himself attracted to one of his young math students named Malati. Ramchandra's wife Goma senses the attraction and she tries to teach her husband a lesson by letting Malati move in with their family and sleep in Ramchandra's bed. Unsurprisingly, Ramchandra struggles with his physical desire for Malati and his emotional desire for his wife. Unless the reader has never seen a soap opera or is too young to recall Bill and Hillary Clinton's marital saga, he or she or she will conclude early on that Goma stands by her man.<P>This novel is notable not for the boring love triangle but for its descriptions of Kathmandu and the many Hindu holidays and festivals that the family celebrates. The reader is transported to a city where an extramarital seduction in a temple means having monkeys wander in on the scene to watch Ramchandra and Malati consumate their desire for one another. There are also a number of descriptions of Hindu religious practices which include animal sacrifices, prayers to goddesses, and funeral services. Most interesting are the descriptions of modern Kathmandu as Ramchandra tries to adjust to his life in an overcrowded city that is on the brink of a political revolution.<P>You won't walk away from this novel having learned ancient Nepali love techniques like the title implies, but you will have been transported to another culture and it may leave you feeling so intrigued you find yourself planning a vacation to this region of the world. Overall, this is a very quick read and I believe that many people will enjoy this novel if they look deeper than the basic plotline.</span>

                    <span>I had heard some big comments about this book. I think thats because readers were expecting to read more interesting novel by The Auther. But, when i read the book i didn't find anything to impress me. The character build up in this novel is not impressive. Auther tries to relate the story with contemporary events in the country but that has nothing to do in fact with the title and mean theme of the book. Goma in this novel is shown so wide and kind hearted, which of course doesn't represent the women from Nepal. Goma is a nepali women and nepali women can't act that way. The character of Malati is also not understandable. Readers can't get enough from her. Her actions in the story simply don't make any sense!<BR>However, there are some good things to get from this. Auther tries to tell the reality of a middle class teacher in Kathmandu. It, more or less describes the life standard of such persons even though they are educated.</span>

                    <span>I read a lot of South Asian literature and this book just does not stand out. It was a quick enough read and the character development was good. I definitely understand all the characters thoughts and motives and I felt for them, but in the end, the story didn't do much for me. And there was something about the happy ending that just seemed too Disney. After all that suffering, everything works out great for everyone in the end? No thank you. The only thing interesting about this one was the setting - Nepal and the political details.</span>
