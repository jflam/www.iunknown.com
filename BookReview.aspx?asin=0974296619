                    <span>I have attended all three levels of Janet's workshops and read her book. My involvement with her approach has helped me resolve many issues around performing. At every workshop attendees would beg her to put out a CD so we could "take her home" with us. This CD more than fills the bill, for it moves you directly into a calm, focused mental state. It beautifully complements what I learned in the workshop and from her book, and I will continue to use it before performances. Janet has made a major contribution to the field of performance anxiety through her strong committment to helping people overcome this issue, and she knows firsthand how debilitating it can be. Thank you, Janet.</span>

                    <span>Public speaking had always been a horrific experience for me.  Yet as a forensic expert I have to frequently teach classes related to my work as well as speaking at various church functions.  These experiences were so dreadful to me that they were actually taking a toll on my physical health.  What I like about this CD is that Janet is very truthful and doesn't offer a magic bullet, but she does show you how to gain control over your reactions to these situations.  It is amazingly simple to implement the techniques presented in this CD and they do work. Still I suspect that most of us who have suffered from this problem never really knew how to access the power within ourselves to overcome our reactions to these situations.  I can't speak for anyone else, but as for me, I would have paid ten times the price for this CD and considered it a bargain.</span>

                    <span>I thought that Janet's CD was extremely effective, and I used it before presentations.  It helped me tremendously and encouraged me to focus on positive thoughts rather than those that were self-defeating.  I would highly recommend it for those with public speaking anxiety, and even those people who only get slightly anxious before presentations.  Loved it!</span>

                    <span>I bought this CD hoping it would help me improve my confidence with public speaking, but I was very disappointed. It has an extremely heavy "new age" and hypnotic feel and sound that I found very irritating. I turned it off after about 15 minutes, and I never plan to turn it on again. It will be headed to Goodwill with the next load.
<br /> 
<br /> I recommend "The Quick & Easy Way to Effective Speaking" by Dale Carnegie. It is a classic that has never been surpassed. It provides extensive help and practical guidance that has been very valuable to me both in terms of technique and confidence. Dale Carnegie was THE expert on public speaking; his books and courses have helped millions of people overcome their fears and become effective speakers. His books have a positive "you can do it" attitude that I like.</span>

                    <span>Having attended an In the Spotlight seminar and having read her book, I can personally attest to the fact that Janet Esposito is a savior. Now, she has provided us with an CD to help us along in our journey toward a better life. She has a first hand knowledge of the issues surrounding "stage fright" and how to deal with them. I have written her numerous e-mails thanking her for being the person that she is and I would like to take this opportunity to thank her again for providing yet another wonderful resource. If performance anxiety is a problem in your life, don't waste another moment in anxious misery. Buy her book, purchase the CD and, most definitely, attend one of her seminars.</span>
