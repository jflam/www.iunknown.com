                    <span>These best kept secrets aren't very well kept secrets, because I knew most of them already.  I heard some of these secrets from other sources before I heard them from Peter Thomson.  However, they are great communication skills and they do work.  I just didn't like Peter Thomson's low-pitched English accent and voice very much.  I found it hard to concentrate on what he was saying even when I was using some of his listening techniques.  I had to turn the volume way up and the bass way down on my car stereo in order to digest what he was saying.  Maybe his book would be better for me.  Overall, it's a very good audio cd if you can stand to listen to it. (4.5 stars)</span>

                    <span>Peter Thompson gives a comprehensive method of improving your communication skills. He gives 9 "secrets" and expounds on them, giving examples, defining them, and tell you how to improve them. These secrets (not in any particular order) include active listening, using body language, asking questions, and others.<p>The great thing about it is that it is entertaining and practical. I enjoyed listening to it and then trying to apply them in my life. Any person in business needs these skills, and I would say anyone can benefit from it, since we all communicate with others (well, unless you are a hermit in the mountains I suppose). <p>He also gives tips on how to better practice these skills and use the audio. Overall, it was a great program.</span>
