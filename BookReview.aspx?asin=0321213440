                    <span>wow, this book is awesome.   i just finished it and purchased the "advanced" version today.  i have several years of programming experience, but when it comes to graphics and animation...zilch!  as a complete new comer to flash, this book has gotten me well on my way for creating some very cool animations.  the thing i like best is that it was very easy for me to just pick up on a new page/chapter at anytime.  the exercises are short and to the point.  just the way i like it.</span>

                    <span>I'm completely new to Flash MX and this book was a great introduction.  As a total newbie I had to work through each chapter before I could move to the next.  However, by the time I got to the end of the book I found that I had very good breadth of knowlege about Flash MX and was well prepared to move to more intermediate books.  This is a great book to get you over Flash MX's big learning curve.</span>

                    <span>I've always wanted to learn Flash but it's a really intimidating program, even if you're very familiar wtih Illustrator, Photoshop, and Quark. I bought just about every instruction book on this program and returned all but this one and the Bible.
<br />
<br />Guess which book got me up and running in no time. The organization of this book is exceptionally clear, and the illustrations they use to show you what to do are just as good as the movieclips that come with other, more expensive instruction manuals. The vector art was something I was already familiar with, but without the step-by-step, illustrated approach in this book, I could not make animations work properly or integrate a Flash movie into an html document.
<br />
<br />The section on Timelines starts by explaining the Flash structure of Frames, Layers, and Scenes in a way that actually makes sense, and then takes you further so that you learn how to organize your images in order to quickly get a movie clip off the ground without slogging through more frames than necessary.
<br />
<br />It ends with chapters on Action Scripting and Video Integration, but at a basic level because those operations are complicated and quite rightly belong in a book on expert Flash usage. You learn a few basic behaviours which go a long way toward making a website look clean and professional, and how to get small video clips to run on your site.
<br />
<br />Overall, it's the best book for someone who's just starting out. An advanced user will either want the next book in this series, or will get the Bible book and call it a day.</span>

                    <span>If you want to try and learn Flash MX 2004 from scratch, go get this book.  It will help you to get to intermediate level fast and with ease especially if you have a good knowledge in image editing.  I guess, first few chapters will be too basic for you.  You may just skip chapters that you think you're already armed with, just like what i did (skipping half of the book's pages), but with no regrets.  After all, learning flash is what I'm after with.  And besides, I haven't completed reading the book yet.  <p>     My brother is learning the book also, but the difference is, he has no knowledge in image editing at all and he's really enjoying learning from the book. He has it 5 stars, I have it 4 stars by a few chapters. We're still trying to learn remaining chapters of the book that would determine the deciding factor.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book for those who want a reference book to see quickly how to do something.  Sufficient depth to be helpful in learning but sufficiently clear to be easy to follow. This should not be the only book you get, but it should be the first one.</span>
