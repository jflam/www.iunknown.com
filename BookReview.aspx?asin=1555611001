                    <span>The Zen of Groups is a useful, informative and easy to read book designed to help the modern day manager deal with the stresses of their workplaces. The book applies the ancient Chinese principles of Zen, or synergy, to the effective management of groups. This book is enjoyable enough to read on your day off or vacation. I would not recommend this book for anyone other than managers or the leaders of groups, as it does not explain better listening techniques or give any useful hints for other members.<br>This book is clear in its commitment to the Zen theory of groups. The book begins by defining Zen, and some of its historical meaning. The whole premise for the Zen theory is that Zen is the practice of being fully awake and in action moment by moment, and if applied to groups and their leaders, it will produce better, more effective group results and task completion. The book seemed to be geared for the manager of the group and not the specific members.<br>The first nine chapters are theories of groups. More specifically, groups nature, issues, development and guidelines. The role of group facilitator was really stressed as being the most important. <br>The authors describe the facilitator role as a manager or leader of the group. The facilitator is the one who can help the group achieve Zen, or synergy.<br>The authors did not cover many different types of groups or members. It also failed to cover leadership styles, which is important to know. The book did, however, stay focused on the theme of the Zen theory more than anything, and achieving synergy or balance in a group. <br>The whole second half of the book is a toolkit for facilitators. This toolkit contains different exercises and techniques the facilitator may use with their groups. Not all of the exercises seem appropriate, and most of them downright ridiculous. Some of the exercises include feet washing and massaging each others back with oil as a way to build group intimacy. The exercises definitely need to be fitted for your particular group.<br>Overall I see this book as light reading for management or management trainees due to its focus on leadership.</span>

                    <span>This group puts together a wonderful message of how to manage group meetings with heart.  They give clear examples of activities that can be used to defuse conflict, enhance team effectiveness, and methods to monitor yourself and your team for leaving your baggage behind and achieving group synergy.  If yours is a consensus-oriented organization, or you'd like to begin using consensus-based decision making, this is a great book.  See also their book specifically for meeting facilitation, "The Art of Facilitation".</span>

                    <span>The Zen of Groups is a handbook for effective group participation.  It achieves this through distinguishing the elements of group dynamics.<p>The Zen of Groups is written in simple language and makes complex and subtile issues clear and easy to understand.  This gives both the beginner and  advanced facilitator or group participant alike access to understanding and  making a useful difference in the dynamics of any group.<p>The Zen of  Groups also has a section of tools and processes which can be applied to  assist groups which are stuck or not acheveing their purpose to move  forward.<p>I highly recomend this book to anyone wanting to develop a  greater understanding of the the dynamics of groups.  I use it all the time  as a resource in my practice as a professional facilitator.</span>
