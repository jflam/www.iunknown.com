                <span id="Label1">This year"s Best American Short Stories is edited by the critically acclaimed and best-selling author Barbara Kingsolver, whose latest book is Prodigal Summer. Kingsolver"s selections for The Best American Short Stories 2001 showcase a wide variety of new voices and masters, such as Alice Munro, Rick Moody, Dorothy West, and John Updike. "Reading these stories was both a distraction from and an anchor to the complexities of my life &mdash; my pleasure, my companionship, my salvation. I hope they will be yours." &mdash; Barbara Kingsolver</span>

                    <span>Kingsolver's introduction is well worth reading (much more thoughtful than Sue Miller's to the newest edition of B.A.S.S.). As always the collection is inconsistent, but there are some real winners: "Servants of the Map" by Andrea Barrett is a tour de force of a narrative with enough ideas and subtleties for a short novel; Rick Bass's "The Fireman" is heartbreakingly compelling; and a pair of stories about married couples and fertility (Elizabeth Graver's "The Mourning Door" and Marisa Silver's "What I Saw From Where I Stood") provide insight and feeling into an oft-experienced situation. Some clunker stories, of course, and very little experimental fiction at all, probably not a surprise given that Kingsolver made the choices. One piece of experimentation is "Boys" by Rick Moody, a clever but ultimately annoying tale that purports to follow the lives of twin boys but manages to cling to overly familiar stereotypes of male behavior. The collection is worth a read.</span>

                    <span>I'm always on the look-out for a good short story - either for my own enjoyment or to use in my reading classes, or to recommend to a friend. So, every year, I buy "The Best American Short Stories." My anticipation grew as I read this year's introduction, "brevity is the soul of everything" Barbara Kingsolver adamantly insisted. Great! I thought. Some short short stories with punch. Humph! Kingsolver then proceeded to select a 43 page novella as her first choice. And it was down hill from there on in. Oh well, there's always next year!</span>

                    <span>Fiction writing is indeed an art. If there is an absolute freedom in any form of writing, its definitely in fiction writing. The point where your own situations could be made, your own characters could be created and where emotions, humour, pain, happiness and much more becomes one... it is fiction. One can write a novel as well as a short story... this book covers many short stories from various writers. Since it has multiple short stories one can never get bored because if not one, the other definitely interests the reader. Since this book serves such diversity and quality in short stories it can soon become 'the bible' or a writer. One can use this book over and over again to see how various writers express the same situation in different ways and how small things like dialouge and setting can make huge difference to a fiction. This book is an interesting cruise... one that could well be called 'a roller-coaster ride' of fiction writing!</span>

                    <span>There is a solemn streak running through this collection. People die in most of the stories. The general idea seems to be that they are supposed to give us insights into human nature and, to be fair, they often succeed. <BR> No science fiction is included. The editors don't say that this exclusion is a policy.It would be interesting to know whether any was considered. Is science fiction too frivolous? For me science fiction is the genre where I am most likely to read short stories rather than full length novels.<BR> The word "American" is broadly interpreted; two stories are set in China, one in the Himalayas, one in Wales and one in Madagascar. <BR> It's tempting to review a short story collection by picking out the ones I like best. In this case the five stars belong to the excellent Foreword by Katrina Kenison (who made the preliminary selection) and the Introduction by Barbara Kingsolver (who didn't have to work so hard) giving reasons we should read short stories and berating us for not doing so.<BR> One reason I read collections like this is the hope of coming across a writer I didn't previously know and must rush out and read read more of. A problem with this collection for this particular purpose is that it contains work by well-known writers; one of the stories I liked best was by a writer whose every book is already on my shelves. The collections are also good for reading on flights with short hops (I bought this one at Logan Airport). For reading in bed or flying to California I need longer narratives.</span>

                    <span>I have always loved the Best-American series. I think they're all excellent ways of tasting some of the best writing that comes out of America each year. Short stories have long been a favourite of mine and I find every year the Best American Short Stories are a joy to read. Not only are short stories perfect for modern American society where one rarely has time to sit down and finish a novel in a decent enough amount of time to remember the beginning when one reaches the end (as guest editor Kingsolver points out in her introduction), but these are the creme de la creme. Kingsolver did a wonderful job at picking them. I enjoyed every single one of them, some more than others of course, and I always come away with a list of books to check out (each author represented in the collection has a short bio and listing of works in the back of the book)... I definitely recommend this and the other Best American Short Stories books to everyone.</span>
