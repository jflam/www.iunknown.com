                    <span>In business, the adage holds - it's not always what you say but how you say it that counts.  Writing That Works provides clear examples of how to write and communicate effectively and efficiently. This edition includes excellent tips on writing and controlling e-mail.  Kudos to the author on his common sense advice to technical writers such as writing "like you talk" and skipping the latest business jargon.  I keep this book on my desk as a reference guide and highly recommend this text to anyone in business, especially to those on my team!</span>
