                    <span>I read a lot of computer books both as part of my day job (unix sysadmin) and on the side (wrote 2 computer books). Normally I'm not moved to write nice things about the competition, but this book is truly impressive.<P>The organization of the chapters is logical, proceeding from introductory to advanced topics in clearly defined stages. The author thankfully resisted the current trend of giving the chapters cutesy names that communicate nothing. The writing is clear and concise. The indexing is superb. The coverage of the subject matter is unbelievably complete, encompassing not only MySQL and general database theory, but also almost every other aspect of database programming.<P>In the six months I've been working with it I've never been unable to find the answer to a MySQL question in this book. Indeed, the Appendices are so good that I have found answers in here when the books I was reading on PHP and the Perl DBI turned out to be wrong.<P>MySQL is a very impressive achievement in all respects.</span>

                    <span>The book is a great reference for the full range of syntax that MySQL offers, and also taught me how to use basic SQL syntax. I did know a bit of SQL before I bought this book but I think if I didn't I wouldn't have a problem understanding it. Once you are through the basics there is a pretty sharp learning curve because it gets in-depth. The book includes PHP coding but I found that to be very hard to understand. "MySQL & PHP from Scratch" was an awsome partner to this book because it included a great PHP reference which this book lacks, and was plenty to get me programming in PHP. I'm not sure how well the installation guide is because my hosting company set up the database. The book also includes some UNIX and Perl DBI help but again I only bought the book for SQL so could not tell you how well those sections are.</span>

                    <span>I give it 4 stars due to lack of info on the Java APIs. This is the best mySql book on out there!! I have a couple of others and sometimes they conflict. The other books don't tell the whole story like how different table types impact certain features - this book does and it always seems to be right. Buy this one and leave the others behind.</span>

                    <span>This book provides excellent broad coverage of all aspects of MySQL and very detailed in-depth coverage as well. I found the chapters on MySQL administration, backup and recovery, and security particularly helpful. The writing is very clear and provides lots of good examples and step-by-step instructions.<P>If you want to become a MySQL expert, read this book!</span>

                    <span>This book is not for beginners, or at least not for those coming from the GUI world without command line experience. Paul makes heavy use of the command line for his examples, and the book in fact contains a large amount of reference content on the command line tools you can use.<P>That said, the majority of the book is written in a well explained fashion, even the reference part at the end has lengthy explanations, so you will always find what you need. The reference section would be the ideal place to look at for type info, function parameters, etc. if the book would not be that heavy, but the precise explanations would not be possible otherwise.<P>This book tries to be everything for everybody, which is hard to accomplish. The first section provides an introduction to SQL, but there is also significant info for system administrators and a huge amount of pages on programming with C, Perl and PHP in connection with MySQL. If you are a beginner, and you are not interested in having your own server, or writing C programs, then this book might not be the best choice. However, if you would like to have a broad overview with details wherever you need, this book is advisable.</span>
