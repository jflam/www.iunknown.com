                    <span>This is a very fine book, and should be read cover-to-cover. It is not a reference book or a beginner's book but I think anyone can gain from reading it.
<br />
<br />I would like to comment on some of the other reviews which "gush" with what reads like professionally-prepared reviews. I am very suspicious of such reviews and you should be too!  </span>

                    <span>This is one of the books that after reading even couple of chapters you feel obligated to leave a feadback on.
<br />This is the apotheosis of techinical writing. Serios, allways on the topic, never condesending or trying to insult your inteligence. 
<br />It is truely well-tempered writing; you go from page to page in somber and attentive procession. 
<br />This book should be included in ISO standards as a stick for measuing other technical writing. 
<br />If you need a SQL book that is a little more mellow, but still a good reading, consider Vieira's book.
<br />If you are still confused why 4 stars, it is because I hate perfection and also am envious of the guy's excelence.</span>

                    <span>This book gives invaluable insights into solving the non-trivial problems that we encounter in SQL that few books cover. An example is the books coverage of hierarchies. This type of data structure appears reasonably often in practice, but few books or courses cover querying hierarchies in SQL in an efficient manner. This book gives them the respect they deserve.
<br />
<br />Other sticky topics include the ins and out of the SELECT statement, which is covered in depth. As well as an excellent section on triggers and transactions.
<br />
<br />The transactions chapter is interesting because it is the only time the book goes into an introductory mode. Most of the book is at the expert level. No time is spent introducing the language or it's syntax. But the transaction chapter does spend some time on the basics.
<br />
<br />There are some downsides. Some chapters are completely dominated by code with little explanatory text or annotations. And the book could have benefited from illustrations, any at all.
<br />
<br />But the value of the book is in it's ability to pass on guru level techniques that will save you weeks of pain in routing out and fixing performance trouble spots. It's in this way that the book is worth every penny to the working SQL Server DBA or Engineer.</span>

                    <span>My company has a mix of SQL Svr 6.5, 7.0, and 2000 servers.  Unfortunately, much of the code in this book is not portable across the three versions - it requires at least 7.0 if not 2000.  Probably half of it will not run on 6.5.  Our corp dev standards require T-SQL that runs on all three, so we couldn't use some of the code in the book.<p>Other than that the book is very good. I had to turn quoted_identifer off to run some of the scripts, but they all run on 7.0 and 2000 just fine.  Not only that but they teach a lot of the new features and secrets of using the language.  How to write system-level code and how to use undocumented features.  We're using the array code in two of our systems as I speak.<p>I'm not saying that requiring SQL Svr 7.0/2000 is a fundamental weakness but it's why I can't give the book 5 stars.  If you are on 7.0 or later and want to write high-quality, speedy, professional code, this is the book to have.  If you need code that is portable back to 6.5 I would suggest Klein's book instead.</span>

                    <span>This book was my lifeline when I moved from Informix to Sql 2k. My shop recently moved all of our applications (about 15) from Informix to Sql 2k. We could not have done it without this book.<p>It builds on what you can find in the product documentation and teaches the many things you have to know to use Transact-Sql in real production systems.  The product docs don't tell even half the story so a book like this is indespensible.<p>We bought 20 copies of this book when we first began researching our migration.  Now that we're through we're adding some more team members so I am buying five more copies this afternoon. I would hate to think where our migration would have ended up without this great book.</span>
