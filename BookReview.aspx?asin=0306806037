                    <span>One of my favorite boxing books ever. Put out in the 1970's, In This Corner is a collection of interviews done by Peter Heller with retired former world champion prizefighters who were champions anywhere from the 1910's to the 1960's. I count a lot of the old time prize fighters among my heroes.</span>

                    <span>i gave this 4 stars for the hard work on the road the author put to gather these interviews from boser--a lot of whom probably we never would not have heard from again if he did not compile these interviews<br>my criticisms of the book are that a lot of the writing from both the author and subjects are too many run on sentences flowing endlessly making it hard to stay interested</span>

                    <span>Although the edition I have is pretty old and the most recent interviews were taken in the 1970s this book is still a fantastic look at the lifes of many of the 20th centuries top boxers. Each boxers story is told in a  single chapter and in their OWN words. Its brilliant reading about how  these champions grew up, what led them to boxing and how they have  survived. As well as the Jack Dempsey's, Jake LaMotta's many other 'lesser  known' boxers are featured but their stories are just, if not more  interesting. A great insight into 20th century american life from those  whose lifes have often been the hardest.<p>Great reading!!!</span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book. It is the type of book one savours as one might enjoy a good glass of wine or an extrordinary meal. As a history teacher I've used it in the classroom to explain historical periods and sports. You  buy this one! You will not be disappointed.</span>
