                    <span>I really like this book. It covers everything about Photoshop Elements 2.0, and it is really well written. I especially like the chapters on working with photos and the chapters on layers. <P>The disk that came with my book has all of the files too; I guess whatever problem there was before is taken care of. <P>It's a great book and I recommend it.</span>

                    <span>The premise of this book is that you will learn by doing. The only problem is that you can't do that because the examples/ aren't on the CD. As an addtional problem, the software that is supposed to calibrate your monitor is also among the missing. Maybe the CD is for an earlier orlater edition but it makes the process very frustrating. Frustrating because the book is very well written and quite comrehensive. And you must have a book if you are to learn this very involved convuluted, if very useful, application.</span>

                    <span>Although the book has good intentions ... well written and to the point,I can hardly recommend it on account of the fact that a number of the files that are referred to in the book are missing on the CD. In particular,a crucial chapter 7 on layering refers to a file in the Chapter 7 folder part of the CD. The folder is not present on my CD and neither is the file. Without it this particular section of the book is valueless.</span>

                    <span>I got Photoshop Elements 2.0 and purchased this book at the same time. It has really helped me learn the program. I would highly recommend it for anyone new to the program, or anyone who used the first version and wants to see whats' new. It really covers everything.</span>
