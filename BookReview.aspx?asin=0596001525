                <span id="Label1">For the intermediate to advanced Java developer, <I>Java Enterprise in a Nutshell</I> shows how to work with all of today's relevant Java APIs. Plus, it's a topnotch reference for all enterprise classes. Part tutorial and part reference work that you can use everyday at your desk, this title is a worthwhile resource for any Java developer building Web or enterprise software.<p>  The practical, succinct focus here on actual Java enterprise APIs helps distinguish this text from the pack. Early sections provide short, clear examples along with just enough background to help you use APIs like JDBC, servlets and JSPs, EJBs, and others. Coverage of Java's ability to interface with legacy CORBA systems is just excellent, with a full tour of Java IDL, CORBA services, and Remote Method Invocation (RMI). Typically, readers will be familiar with some J2EE APIs and not others. This book can help fill in the gaps. <p>  Updated with the latest standards from Sun, including JDBC 3.0, Servlet 2.3, and EJB 2.0, this is an essential primer for today's high-end (and high-paying) Java. The basic presentation of servlets/JSP and EJBs (among the most important APIs for current Java Web development) is concise and nicely digestible. We also liked the chapter on JMS for messaging (also a hotbed of Java job activity). <p>  The second half of this text lists every J2EE class, along with methods and properties, in a very valuable reference section that makes good use of two-toned shading for easy access. Entries are organized by package name. (One small oversight here is that an index of cross-listed packages, classes, and methods omits page numbers.) <p>  Overall, this book is truly indispensable for any working Java programmer. The second edition of <I>Java Enterprise in a Nutshell</I> is a fully up-to-date tutorial and reference that lives up to the standards of O'Reilly&#146;s Nutshell series. Both thorough and concise, it's a handy resource for anyone who works with the hundreds and thousands of Java enterprise APIs on a regular basis. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Introduction to enterprise computing with the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE), survey of Java enterprise APIs, JDBC 3.0 (including database connections, ResultSets, prepared statements, BLOB fields, transaction support, stored procedures), the JDBC Optional Package (and connection pooling), Remote Method Invocation (RMI) described (building stubs and skeletons, dynamically loaded classes and remote object activation, RMI over IIOP), in-depth tutorial for Java IDL (with CORBA) and designing remote objects, Java Servlet 2.3 APIs (basic servlet processing and the servlet lifecycle, chaining and filters, thread safety, managing state, cookies, servlets used with JDBC), JavaServer Pages (JSP): including custom tags, JNDI and directory tutorial (contexts, looking up objects, accessing and modifying directory entries), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 2.0 (conventions for entity, session and message beans, using transactions), Java XML APIs (DOM, SAX and XSLT), Java Message Service (JMS), point-to-point and publish-subscribe messaging models, message selectors, JavaMail, reference to SQL and relational databases, RMI tools, reference to all IDL keywords, data types and declarations; CORBA services, Java IDL tool reference, Enterprise JavaBeans Query Language (EJB QL) 2.0 query language, and an alphabetical listing of all APIs for Java enterprise programming (listing of classes, methods, and properties). </span>

                    <span>"Java Enterprise in a Nutshell" is a good quick reference guide to the entire J2EE platform for intermediate-level Java developers, and the 2nd Edition seems very up-to-date with J2EE 1.3. The book is a lot larger than other 'in a nutshell' books, mainly because there is such a huge amount of information to be covered for the J2EE platform. It is divided into two main sections - the "Introduction" section, which gives an overview of all the major J2EE technologies, and the API-reference, which I found to just be a rehash of what is in the online Javadoc API. The Introduction it easy to understand and straight-to-the-point for the intermediate Java developer, giving good examples of how to use the technologies. I found it to be a good guide to quickly learn some of the technologies I was not very familiar with. (but needed to use right away...) I did not use the API reference, but it could be useful for understanding the basic purposes of each package and class. It does not go into the method-by-method detail that the online Javadoc has.</span>

                    <span>Disclaimer: I am an avowed O'Reilly technical series fan, and proud of it. Whenever I want to understand a new technology I head to the O'Reilly shelf in my local Borders before I look anywhere else. So adjust your expectations accordingly.<P>As the name implies, this massive tome (971 pages stem to stern) covers a mind numbing range of technologies associated with "Enterprise" Java software development. There are 17 sections in all, as well as your standard API reference pages. As you would expect, all of the usual suspects are there - Servlets, JSP's, EJB's, JNDI, RMI, CORBA, etc. In addition there were other enterprise technologies that I found useful as well - Messaging, SQL, Java Mail and so on.<P>When I sat down with this book my intention was to skim through each section, look to see if there was anything that they missed, and crank out the 'ol review. What I found was enough content in each of the technical sections to draw me into actually reading the whole section. I mean, who would take the time to read a full section on CORBA nowadays unless there were interesting things there (yes, I see all of you CORBA proponents shaking your fists out there - don't you have some IDL to write?).<P>Once I completed the reference sections I cracked open the latter half of the book to take a peek at the API section. I found it well organized, asthetically pleasing, and about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Note that this API publishing is NOT unique to O'Reilly - It seems that most of the technical publishing companies still commit arboreal mass murder to publish these API sections. Note to publishers: When the half life of the information you are printing is measured in months, think about a different delivery mechanism. I actually timed how long it took to find a reference using JavaDoc API info and a book. IIRC the JavaDoc lookup was about 3 times faster.<P>Enough of that drivel. Back to the review. As you read through the different technical sections of this book the individual styles of the authors become apparent - you can tell that different sections are written by different authors. This is A GOOD THING - you are getting the technical poop from the one that knows the subject best. To rely on a single author for this size of reference would leave a lot of gray area.<P>There is one specific area that I want to drill into, and that is the technical examples. I consider myself a relatively informed and skilled enterprise software architect (in the J2EE world - don't get me started on that Dot Net [stuff]). When I see a manual entitled Java Enterprise - I am expecting not only an API reference (see API rant above), but some real meat as to best practices in building enterprise level applications using this technology.<P>So how did this book due in the technical example area? I'd have to give it a B. In most cases the examples were adequate to explain the technology at hand, but not really give deep insight into how best to take advantage of said technology. Now, don't get me wrong - this book has earned a place on the "near" bookshelf (the place where I keep all of my most referenced manuals). My opinion is that when you are trying to serve to very different purposes (desktop reference / enterprise technology primer) something has to give.<P>Let me give a couple of examples of what I am talking about:<P>1) In the JDBC section there is a point where the book identifies OODBMS (Object Oriented DBMS) databases as a possible alternative to the rigors of Object/Relational mapping. Yes, the technology exists and does work, but how many companies out there run enterprise systems off of OODBMS's? It's a small market, and with the massive investments that most US companies have in RDB's that equation is not going to change soon. To say that OODB's are an alternative is a good thing in a quick reference, but in my opinion needs a disclaimer if mentioned in an enterprise java book. Along those same lines it wouldn't have hurt to mention some of the available O/R mapping tools out there (go Open Source!).<P>2) In the Servlets section there is a point where an application implementation is mentioned to illustrate a technical point (binding a java.sql.Connection instance to a HTTP session). Right in the same paragraph the author mentions that this is a "bad idea" (no kidding - unless you are an Oracle sales rep...). Now why go to all of the effort of painting this example, and then telling the reader that they shouldn't ever do it? Guys - take the time to figure out a valid example that illustrates the part of the API that you are explaining, 'kay?<P>Again, don't get the wrong idea here. I'm definitely not panning this book. It's a valuable resource and worth the $...that you are going to plunk down for it. But if you are going to write a desktop reference for Enterprise Java make sure that the examples are restauraunt quality. After all, there is enough bad code out there in the world, and we can't have our beloved O'Reilly contributing to it, can we?<P>In Summary (Finally! he's almost done!):<P>As I mentioned before, this book has earned the right to be within arms reach from my little work pod. Not only is it a comprehensive reference, it makes a handy workout aide as well (971 pages...). And do yourself a favor. If you haven't checked out the O'Reilly line of technical books, head down to the nearest bookstore, grab yourself a double latte (try the Irish Cream and Hazelnut mixed together), find a comfy chair and give the series a once-over. You'll be glad you did.<P>Jonathan House</span>

                    <span>Another large and impressive manual to add to your collection. This title is meant to be the third volume of a three-volume set that covers the entire language. Volume one covers the basic core Java APIs, while volume two covers the foundation classes.<P>Of the three volumes that make up this Nutshell series, this is the one that you'll be able to bypass if you're just moving into the world of Java. I think that even experienced programmers might end up heavily using some chapters while never touching others. The format is the same as other Nutshell volumes, where there is a lot of detail with not a lot of fluffy explanation.<P>Each of the Part 1 chapters give a quick overview and tutorial as to what the technology is (such as JavaServer Pages) and how it works. There are some examples of code to help you understand how it works. But the authors acknowledge that they do not expect you to be an expert after reading that chapter. You have to either already know what's going on or seek out another book to more fully learn and understand what is going on. O'Reilly has a vast array of books that go into each of these subjects in a more detailed manner.<P>For Notes/Domino 5 developers, I would say that there is little in this book that would be of value to you. You might be interested in JDBC as a replacement/supplement to ODBC. The XML chapter with information on parsers might also be of interest. Moving into the Notes/Domino 6 world, more of the book becomes valuable. Those chapters would include the information on servlets and JavaServer Pages. As Notes/Domino becomes more tightly integrated with Websphere, you'll need to start understanding servlets and how they function. This book could be a good tool to help you build them.<P>Conclusion<BR>If you're an advanced Java developer and are working on enterprise Java applications, get this book. If you're a Notes/Domino developer looking to move into servlets, JavaServer Pages, and XML, you should also get this book. If you don't fit into either of these categories, you probably won't do much with this volume.</span>

                    <span>First of All, this book does not cover everything about J2EE,but it has many of the significant things related to J2EE (such as CORBA,IIOP).<P> <BR>In my opinion,this book is very suitable for any person who need to have a J2EE overview/introduction.And also suit for J2EE developer who need the good references rather than print all J2EE API.<P>I recommend you to put it on the bookshelf!...</span>

                    <span>One of the seemingly endless "in a Nutshell" series from O'Reilly, this book follows the basic series format. A few chapters of concise introduction followed by a detailed, if compressed, API reference. In this case the book covers a lot of ground - all the Java APIs which form part of the Java 2 Enterprise Edition: JDBC, RMI, CORBA, JNDI, Servlets, EJB as well as some material on JMS. Check which edition you get as the information dates quickly, though. <P>I was worried when I bought this book that they were attempting to cover too much, but I think they have done a remarkable job. This book really is the most readable introduction to J2EE I have found so far. It's just about small enough to carry about (unlike the massive Wrox tomes), and the API reference can help to keep it useful after you've absorbed the introductory material. It even has a basic SQL reference, which you don't get in some JDBC books!</span>
