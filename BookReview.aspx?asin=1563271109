                    <span>As far as I can see it is a book all about different perspectives, a book that adds on to the list of books that focus on the theoretical and/or philosophical sides of learning organizations. As such it is a good book, with contributions from 40 acknowledged authors/researchers.<br>The book is built up around four parts:<br>- Guiding ideas<br>- Theories/Methods/Processes<br>- Infrastructure<br>- Arenas of Practice<br>The book is packed with lots of good ideas that may form a base for further exploration in the field. Most of it is well edited, even though there is some extra "fluff" in some of the articles.<br>It is a good introduction to "learning organizations", but I will hesitate to call it a "how-to"-book . . . .</span>

                    <span>I've had to read a slew of leadership books for my doctorate -- as for a collection of thoughtful essays, this is one of the best.  It's well organized, well laid out and has almost every major thinker represented.  It's got theoretical parts, practical parts and questions for down the road.  The essays span all types of learning organizations:  schools, hospitals, companies, etc...  It's a bit long, but if you take it piece by piece, this is a very enjoyable and informative collection.  Highly recommended and well-conceived.</span>

                    <span>What is a learning organization? What are the principles upon which a learning organization is built? What is needed to develop a culture that embraces these principles? The concept of the learning organization began  several decades ago, but only recently has it gained widespread recognition  among business people and academics alike.  This is in part due to the  success of Peter Senge's 1990 book The Fifth Discipline and his pragmatic,  step-by-step guide, The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook (1994). <p>Thirty-nine  of the most respected scholars and practitioners come together to share a  comprehensive explanation of the ideas, principles, attitudes, skills,  systems, and infrastructure needed to create the ideal workplace of the  future. Authors including MIT's Fred Kofman and Peter Senge, Harvard's  Rosabeth Kanter, and London Business School's Charles Handy are recognized  worldwide for their work in teaching organizations about change, systems  thinking, organizational development, diversity, and total quality  management. <p>The author's essays are categorized into five main parts.  Part One: Guiding Ideas primes our intellect by posing questions and  sharing ideas about what learning organizations represent. Part Two:  Theories/Methods/Processes presents how stories, dialogue, coaching,  systems thinking, and other learning tools facilitate the creation of  learning organizations. Part Three: Infrastructure identifies some of the  ways we must change what we do to achieve maximum learning potential. Part  Four: Arenas of Practice identifies various workplaces and takes a look at  how to build learning organizations within them. Case studies are used to  describe how learning organizations are working in various organizational  settings. <p>This book is written for practitioners, scholars, and active  participants of adult learning environments. The principles and practices  can apply to any organization that wishes to increase its learning  potential, including businesses, schools, health care, and governmental  organizations.<p>The rate at which organizations and individuals learn must  keep up with the ever-changing environment that surrounds them. This is a  global environment that requires us to communicate and learn from our  co-workers, customers, clients, competitors, investors, friends, and  family. Our world is becoming increasingly interconnected and it would be  prudent to take advantage of that fact. We are not islands and as such, we  cannot learn alone. The more skilled we become at applying the breadth of  knowledge and skills that are presented in this book on becoming a learning  organization, the more prepared we will be for competing in the Knowledge  Era.</span>
