                <span id="Label1">An enormous system comprising myriad technologies, options, and releases, Oracle's complexities have spawned numerous areas of specialization. For each area of specialization there are equally specialized how-to books and manuals. O'Reilly's <i>Oracle Essentials</i> claims a unique place among these books. Rather than focusing on one area, the book explains the foundational concepts of the Oracle technology and the core technical and business aspects of using it.  The new edition of this classic book, <i>Oracle Essentials, 3rd Edition: Oracle Database 10</i>g, distills a vast amount of knowledge into an easy-to-read volume covering every aspect of the Oracle database. Readers of all levels will learn about Oracle's features and technologies, including the product line, architecture, data structures, networking, concurrency, tuning, and much more.   Featuring focused text, abundant illustrations, and helpful hints, the new edition offers a valuable overview of Oracle's Database 10<i>g</i>--the industry's first database to support grid computing. Recent releases such as Oracle 9<i>i</i> and 8<i>i</i> are also covered. The book contains chapters on:<ul><li>Oracle products, options, and overall architecture for Oracle 10<i>g</i> and prior recent releases</li> <li>Installing and running Oracle: how to configure, start up, and shut down the database, and various networking issues</li> <li>Oracle data structures, datatypes, and ways of extending datatypes, with an introduction to Oracle objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes)</li><li>Managing Oracle: security, the Oracle Enterprise Manager, fragmentation and reorganization, and backup and recovery</li> <li>Oracle performance: characteristics of disk, memory, and CPU tuning</li><li>Multi-user concurrency, online transaction processing (OLTP), and high availability</li> <li>Hardware architectures (e.g., SMP, MPP, NUMA) and their impact on Oracle</li> <li>Data warehousing and distributed databases</li> <li>Network deployment: using Oracle as an Internet computing platform and for grid computing</li><li>What's new in Oracle 10<i>g</i>: a summary of the database changes described in the book</li></ul><i>Oracle Essentials, 3rd Edition: Oracle Database 10</i>g was written for anyone whose job involves managing or building systems using Oracle DBMS technology or working with staff that uses Oracle technology.  This book is the perfect all-in-one source for understanding the complexities and capabilities of Oracle. </span>

                    <span>I've used a number of different database systems before, but never had the pleasure of working with Oracle's software.  I installed a development version of 10g and was somewhat taken aback when the installer proudly announced "169 products installed."  I glumly thought "Gee, hope the database server is in there somewhere."
<br />
<br />I picked up a copy of Oracle Essentials and found it to be an excellent introduction to Oracle.  The book is short enough to read end-to-end, but it is packed with information about Oracle's architecture and most of those 169 products.  The authors write lucidly, in an easily accessible style.  Even though the book is eminently readable, it doesn't "talk down" to the reader, nor skimp on details.  There is surprising depth in so short a book with such broad scope!
<br />
<br />As another reviewer mentioned, there is essentially nothing about SQL and PL/SQL in this book.  That's okay with me - there are plenty of excellent texts on those two topics.
<br />
<br />Oracle Essentials claims it is "What you need to know about Oracle Database architecture and features."  I agree completely!</span>

                    <span>I code databases for a living and use Oracle quite often. I picked this book  to increase my knowledge on the oracle database partly out of curiosity. The book is refreshingly small (~300 pages) but make no mistake, this doesn't leave many essentials out. It doesn't cover SQL and PL/SQL though. It's a one trick pony which is very good at what it advertises i.e. good intro to database architecture and features</span>

                    <span>As with most O'Reilly books, Oracle Essentials is crammed full of information.  The book is geared for DBA's, system admins and developers.  The book assumes some general knowledge of databases, but most concepts are explained as they come up.  For example, there are sidebars for normalization and RAID.<p>The third edition is updated for Oracle 10g.  Since the authors point out which features are specific to Oracle 8i, 9i and 10g, this book is just as useful for older versions of Oracle.  For readers of previous editions, the book has an appendix directing the reader to the new 10g content.<p>For developers, using Java with Oracle is explained.  There are good sections on SQLJ, JDBC, EJBs and Java stored procedures.  For DBA's and system admins, the book covers architecture, failover and deployment.<p>The book uses a good mix of text, diagrams and examples.  Many cutting-edge topics are explained with a non-platform specific background of the topic and examples.  These topics include OLTP, Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence and of course - Grid Computing.<p>I found the list of major technologies to be extremely useful.  Chapter 1 has a paragraph on Oracle features in the database, application server and standalone development tools.  The rest of the book focuses on the database itself.  This book covers almost everything you would want to know about Oracle and provides references for more detail on each topic.  If you are only going to buy one Oracle book, this is the one to buy.</span>

                    <span>I approach each release of Oracle with trepidation simply because each release contains so many new features and with it a considerable amount of documentation.<p>I think everyone who is considering Oracle 10g should definitely purchase Oracle Essentials - Oracle Database 10g. It succinctly gives the highlights of the database in general as well as specific new features in an easily digestable manner. It not only explains the parts and pieces of the database, but why and how they are used.  This book is heaven sent for me.  This compact book gives me everything I need to know in one terrific volume and encourages me to delve further in the specific areas I need to know.<p>As for one of the authors, Bob Stackowiak, I have known him for many years and have always been impressed with his breadth of knowledge on the database.  To recently discover that he is one of the authors of this book makes it all the more compelling to read.<p>I highly recommend this book.</span>
