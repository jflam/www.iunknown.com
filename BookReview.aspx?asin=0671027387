                    <span>This really is just an average book, just like the other Dan Brown novels.  Dan Brown seems to be very good at building up a story but very bad at creating knockout endings.  Both Da Vinci Code and Deception Point suffer from dissapointing endings, which leave the reader with a sour taste after such a promising start.
<br />
<br />This is mildly entertaining and at times gripping, easy reading but not really thought provoking.  
<br />
<br />Buy this if you have a long haul flight, or are embarking on a long journey.</span>

                    <span>Dan Brown has found his niche in hypothetical conspiracy theories.    I read Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, I enjoyed them (like enjoying a Big Mac) even though I felt like he had violated the "suspention of disbelief" code.  But when I read Deception Point I felt like I was dealing with a dangerous level of "dumbing down."
<br />
<br />Dan Brown's true niche is in exploiting the paranoia of the uninformed. I had laughed at the idea that Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code would probably keep the Vatican on its toes for a while.  I figured, they're going to be working overtime to keep the conspiracy theories at bay.  But I'm not laughing now because he's developed a huge cult following.  Deception Point's anti-science paranoia is not funny at all in that context.
<br />
<br />Read this book and think not about advanced science/political conspiracies but about the altruistic nature of science and the self-serving needs of pulp fiction marketing.</span>

                    <span>Dan Brown knows just how to keep you hanging on... to the point that I could not put this book down!  Every spare moment I had, I was digging in and trying to figure it out.  It keeps moving the whole time, full of action and moments when you are down right befuddled!  A true sign of an excellent writer, he elicits many emotions, some simultaneously!  What happens in just over 24 hours is amazing.  Long before the hit TV show "24", this author had 24 hours of action and adventure all figured out.</span>

                    <span>Dear Mr. Brown,
<br />
<br />You don't need to prove to us that you subscribe to "Janes Defence Weekly" by quoting the make and model of every single helicopter ("chopper" means something else in the UK, by the way) that appears in your book.
<br />
<br />Your books are ruined by the inclusion of "fantastic machines" that bear little relevance to the plot (the X-33 in Angels and Demons, the Aurora in Deception Point) and could be edited out with some creative writing. Why can't the coastguard fly a Seaking, instead of an Osprey?
<br />
<br />If you could let me know what all of your characters take to stay awake for days on end, then I would be most grateful.
<br />
<br />Ta very much,
<br />
<br />R</span>

                    <span>Rachel Sexton works for the NRO - an intelligence agency located just outside of DC.  Its Director is a vocal opponent to NASA because of its security leaks.  Her father is running for President against the incumbant and has hinged his entire platform on the concept of NASA overspending the taxpayers money.  She abhors her father and finds herself in the middle of a scientific discovery that will change the world and her father's ruthless campaign that will be toppled by the discovery.  Add meteorites and murderous Delta Forces, and you have Deception Point.
<br />
<br />Does this description sound convoluted and ridiculous?  That's pretty much how Dan Brown's novel reads.  It's mindless entertainment, and the plot is just not very good.  Often I found myself saying, "Ok, please get to the point."  This novel is not the "fast paced thriller" some of the reviews advertise, but it is not all bad.  Do not pick it up expecting an award winner, but instead something to read on the beach.  Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code are much better despite being "beach reads" themselves.</span>
