                <span id="Label1">Short and snappy as it is, Stephen King's <I>On Writing</I> really contains two books: a fondly sardonic autobiography and a tough-love lesson for aspiring novelists. The memoir is terrific stuff, a vivid description of how a writer grew out of a misbehaving kid. You're right there with the young author as he's tormented by poison ivy, gas-passing babysitters, uptight schoolmarms, and a laundry job nastier than Jack London's. It's a ripping yarn that casts a sharp light on his fiction. This was a child who dug Yvette Vickers from <I>Attack of the Giant Leeches</I>, not Sandra Dee.  "I wanted monsters that ate whole cities, radioactive corpses that came out of the ocean and ate surfers, and girls in black bras who looked like trailer trash." But massive reading on all literary levels was a craving just as crucial, and soon King was the published author of "I Was a Teen-Age Graverobber." As a young adult raising a family in a trailer, King started a story inspired by his stint as a janitor cleaning a high-school girls locker room. He crumpled it up, but his writer wife retrieved it from the trash, and using her advice about the girl milieu and his own memories of two reviled teenage classmates who died young, he came up with <I>Carrie</I>. King gives us lots of revelations about his life and work. The kidnapper character in <I>Misery</I>, the mind-possessing monsters in <I>The Tommyknockers</I>, and the haunting of the blocked writer in <I>The Shining</I> symbolized his cocaine and booze addiction (overcome thanks to his wife's intervention, which he describes). "There's one novel, <I>Cujo</I>, that I barely remember writing." <p>  King also evokes his college days and his recovery from the van crash that nearly killed him, but the focus is always on what it all means to the craft. He gives you a whole writer's "tool kit": a reading list, writing assignments, a corrected story, and nuts-and-bolts advice on dollars and cents, plot and character, the basic building block of the paragraph, and literary models. He shows what you can learn from H.P. Lovecraft's arcane vocabulary, Hemingway's leanness, Grisham's authenticity, Richard Dooling's artful obscenity, Jonathan Kellerman's sentence fragments. He explains why <I>Hart's War</I> is a great story marred by a tin ear for dialogue, and how Elmore Leonard's <I>Be Cool</I> could be the antidote. <p>  King isn't just a writer, he's a true teacher. <I>--Tim Appelo</I> </span>

                    <span>About the only thing in common between King and myself is our first name. Other than that, our views on writing (based on those expressed in this book) could be worlds apart.
<br />
<br />It's not necessarily true that I disagree with the points he raised. Just that writing is such an individual undertaking that no hard-and-fast rule can ever hold true. And King imposes several such rules in his book.
<br />
<br />An example is King's insistence on the use of adverbs in dialogue attribution "only in the rarest and most special of occasions". This may actually compromise a writer's individual style. The point here is that not everybody aspires to be a good dialogue writer. Imagine populating a 30-page dialogue with purely "he/she said".
<br />
<br />While many of his advice are spot-on indeed, you can't help but wonder if it makes sense to follow them. After all, not everybody wants to write fiction. And certainly not everybody wants to write fiction the way King does.
<br />
<br />For instance, King harbours a deep distrust for plot. Instead, he prefers to start with a situation and mould the character from there. This approach may not work for writers whose strength lies elsewhere.
<br />
<br />True, the story should always be the boss. But if your characters were shallow, readers would have a hard time developing a sense of association. And if readers cannot associate with the character, think of how they would feel about the story itself.
<br />
<br />Part of the problem with "On Writing" is that you need to be familiar with King's work in order to understand the points he's driving at. I wouldn't consider this approach as a shameless plug on the part of the author, but it does make it more difficult for non-fans to align themselves to his ideas.
<br />
<br />All in all, "On Writing" is a good read if you want to gain insight into the thought processes of one of the most successful fiction writers of our times. But if you follow the tips to a T, you may end up as another Stephen King, which may not exactly be a good thing.

                    </div>
                    <span>Quite simply, this is the most inspiring book on the writing craft that you will ever read. First, because Stephen King gives you a glimpse into the early stages of his career as a writer, when he struggled as hard as anyone to get something published. He is brutally candid about the shortcomings of his early work, yet clear about how much he loved to write and the sheer volume of writing necessary to improve.
<br />
<br />And second, because he gives you an honest description of his method of approaching a story. But he does so not in a pedantic, academic way but rather with the storytelling magic for which he's become so famous. It's the most entertaining look at the writer's craft that you're ever likely to read. 
<br />
<br />Buy it to learn about the craft. Buy it to simply enjoy. It's as much fun to read as his novels.

                    <span>I wish I'd have read this Stephen King title before I wrote my first piece of published work.  This book helped me to overcome writer's block, which was caused by excessive plotting, and motivated me to begin working an a new novel.
<br />
<br />The thing I found very disappointing was King's invitation for his readers to write six or seven pages about a scenario he outlined and email the work to him through his website.  He said he wouldn't respond to everyone, but he'd read them all.  I spent several hours doing so, and although it helped me as a writer, it bothered me to read his webmaster's response.  Basically, King didn't expect anyone to respond and doesn't fulfill his promise of reading them.</span>

                    <span>I was also afraid of being a writer. The ideas and words in my mind were and in many ways are puzzles I have a hard time connecting. One thing about being a writer is that you can and you sould be expressive; it is your god given rite. Although I'm sure a lot of people would argue that with me. I read half his book in one three hour sitting, savoring each and every work as though it was psychology to my confustion. Years of college instruction on writing couldn't make up for one six hour reading that King offeres here. Now, I look at my existance in a much brighter, less frightning way. King paves your way with his steps and by the time you are through reading this mastepiece you find your way in the seat of a writer.</span>

                    <span>I have always admired Stephen King throughout his long and successful writing career.  When I saw this book, I decided to read it as well.  I must say that this title only further enhanced my admiration for the man.
<br />
<br />I found very useful advice and insight for any aspiring author.  The advice contained in this book makes it worth the price.  However, it doesn't stop there.  Stephen King walks us through how his career began and the struggles he had in getting there and staying there.
<br />
<br />Mr. King even comments on the accident in Maine that left him with serious injuries.  Aspiring writer or just a Stephen King fan, this book is for all of you.</span>
