                <span id="Label1"><div>Based on the increasingly popular weekly football commentary on the e-zine <i>Slate</i>, <i>Tuesday Morning Quarterback</i> showcases the esoteric humor that has made Gregg Easterbrook's column a hit with sports fans on the Internet. By using Zen poetry, Newtonian physics, historical allusions, and other conceits, Easterbrook creates a fresh, ironic commentary to the philosophy of the game. Including mostly original material as well as a handful of classic <i>TMQ </i>commentary from his column, this book, in the wry humorous tradition of <i>Golf in the Kingdom, The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook, </i>and <i>O Holy Cow!</i> The Selected Verse of Phil Rizzuto, is an intriguingly oddball yet right-on-the-money examination of football and its culture.<br></div></span>

                    <span>I am a pretty avid fan of Gregg Easterbrook's writing for Slate and now ESPN. I bought this book expecting it to be of the same quality as the columns. Quite honestly, I would have settled for simply the material given in the columns with no improvement. Instead this book takes same material that is so interesting in the columns (the importance of fake kicks, proper sideline attire for cold weather, unusual college mascots) and presents them so quickly that they lose both their humor and informativeness. Part of the problem is that Easterbrook's observations seem much keener in the column, applied to last weekend's games, but I think Easterbrook still could have written a much better book, and I hope he does.</span>

                    <span>This is a great little book if you've never read a greg easterbrook column. It's a good book if you've read one column and enjoyed it. It's pretty dull if you are a loyal reader of his columns. Easterbrook has a few key ideas. (Stop me before I blitz again; no, that's not a *double* reverse; coach + parka = loss; cheerleaders are hot, etc.) Each tuesday it's fun to see how they are apply to the previous weekend's games, but here, the book seems like just a poor rehash of his columns. Even some of the Haiku has been in his columns already.<P>If you've never read Easterbrook, buy the book, then read his columns (now on ESPN Page 2). If you are an Easterbrook loyalist, don't buy the book for yourself, but maybe give it someone else (after flipping through to read the Haiku).</span>

                    <span>Gregg Easterbrook (aka Tuesday Morning Quarterback) has been my favorite columnist since I first found him on Slate a while back. When the football season concluded this year, I knew I had to get this book to fight withdrawal over the season.<P>However, I soon found one major flaw--the only one I ever found: It's far too short. I read it in one sitting. While I truly enjoyed it, it seemed that, if the pictures and such were removed, the remaining text would be no longer than one of his columns.<P>The insights are still great, and the concept of football haiku--not to mention its excellent execution--is something that I still love the idea of.</span>

                    <span>For those fans of Easterbrook's TMQ column at slate.com, this book is right up their alley. A Brookings Inst. Fellow writing football haiku's? What took so long? A great survey from the edges of football with plenty of humor thrown in. Definitely going to buy a few copies as stocking stuffers for the lads who rejoice in every Giant victory. The Heidi game and blitz strategies. Only Easterbrook.</span>

                    <span>This book turns out to be really tiny with postcard sized pages, thick paper, wide margins, and lots of full-page, old-fashioned photos of football players I didn't recognize.<P>I think Gregg Easterbrook's weekly columns on Slate.com are great. Some of the best commentary on football I've ever read (and I've been watching and reading about football for more than 30 years, though only as a fan). However, this book is really more of a "joke" than it is a real book. I read it in less than 30 minutes. It contained nothing that I didn't already know as a result of reading his columns.<P>A collection of his columns with weekly scores and some additional information about last season might have been a useful book (that's kind of what I thought I would be getting). I don't really understand what Mr. Easterbook thought this book was about. Football poetry? Three or four general observations on football put together in a easy to read format?<P>Bottom line: not worth my money. I would never have bought this if I'd seen it in a bookstore as opposed to "online". One of the down-sides about buying online :-(</span>
