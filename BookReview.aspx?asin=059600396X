                <span id="Label1">Updated to cover Flash MX, the newest version of Macromedia Flash, <i>ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide</i>, Second Edition is the one book no serious Flash developer should be without.  Author Colin Moock, one of the most universally respected developers in the Flash community, has added hundreds of new code examples to show new Flash MX techniques in the real world:  how to draw circles, save data to disk, convert arrays to onscreen tables, create reusable components, and preload variables, XML, and sounds.  The book's language reference alone has nearly doubled from the first edition, with more than 250 new classes, objects, methods, and properties.  You'll find exhaustive coverage of dozens of undocumented, under-documented, and mis-documented features.  Along with the new material, Colin Moock has meticulously revised the entire text to conform to Flash MX best-coding practices.   From sending data between two movies to creating getter/setter properties, the new edition of this book demystifies the often-confusing new features of Flash MX, giving developers easy access to its powerful new capabilities.</span>

                    <span>This book is a gem. For new-to-programming or experienced programmer alike, this book will be undeniably useful.<P>Colin teaches you how to program in Actionscript. Infact, little in this book can be simply copy and pasted into your project... That's the beauty!<P>Unique flash solutions as with anything, created by fresh, intelegent minds with an appreciation of the tools they have to work with. Colin teaches you the subtle aspects of Macromedia Flash and it's powerful scripting language.<P>He uses generic programming terminology and introduces and explains them for the new programmer. This is very, very important for new programmers who wish to move themselves at some point across to another language.<P>Since leanrning Actionscript with Colin (Beginning of 2003) I have moved into learning PHP/MySQL. And thanks to Colin I can happily browse through the functions list or the language reference and have a pretty good idea what I'm reading.<P>Not for the unthinking-quickdraw type, this book is for thinkers and I give it 110% for optimising the time you spend reading/studying it vs. the results you get.<P>As for myself, productivity on generic flash websites has doubled, and the quality of the websites has also. Actionscript is developing with each release of Flash and will turn from being a designers-only tool to a programmers-who-can-design tool. <P>So all you designers out there - get studying!</span>

                    <span>This edition of "ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide" is truly definitive. Its language reference alone has almost doubled, when compared to what featured in the previous edition. A lot of new methods, classes, objects, and properties have been added. Also, there are hundreds of new code examples which simplified the latest techniques of Flash MX: thus making tasks like: how to create reusable components, draw circles, save data to disk, preload variables and convert arrays to onscreen tables, more understandable.<BR>This book is really superb. Its beauty is that it analyzed every aspect of Flash MX tools, including all the undocumented and misdocumented features.</span>

                    <span>This book claims to be "The Definitive Guide," but it contains not a single word about ActionScript to support Flash Remoting. For example, where's the discussion of NetServices.createGatewayConnection()? For help in writing ActionScript to interact with a database, you will have to consult another reference source.<P>The author has an annoying writing style in which he repeatedly refers to "we," as in: "When we export...a .swf file from a .fla file, we can incorporate...." Sometimes, though, he switches to "you," as in: "To append or insert script text instead of replacing it, you must manually copy and paste...." What we/you need here is a good edit.<P>Aside from the two criticisms addressed above, I'd rate this book as average in quality in completeness, clarity, and accuracy. Code samples work. The index is a bit thin. Some of the more complicated topics (e.g., "Move Clip Subclasses and Components") could have been enhanced through the use of additional examples.<P>As an O'Reilly book, this book is below average in quality.</span>

                    <span>I would just like to say, this book is great. I am almost brand new to Flash, and I'm fourteen. This book covers all aspects of Web design, including some implementation of basic HTML into Flash, communication with Server-side scripts, such as PHP or CGI, and the reference is awesome. It gives detailed examples of every function, and really helps if you want to get to know how to do something, fast. I have been recommending this book to a friend of mine, who is a more experienced programmer than me, and who recently bought Flash MX 2k4 Pro. I recommend it to you, to, if you are interested in programming Flash MX.</span>

                    <span>I've been using Flash now for about three years and have got more and more into the programming/development aspect. I'm an active part of the Flash communities and had heard a lot about Colin through the forums, which prompted me to buy his book. I consider it a must for anyone who is serious about developing applications within the Flash environment from the very beginner to expert. His style of writing makes it easy to quickly get to grips with even the most complicated areas of actionscript 1. I always keep the book within arms length of my computer as the thorough language reference section regularly provides me with not just ways of doing things, but explains best practices and why. <BR>I have bought quite a few instructional books particularly relating to Flash and this is the best by a mile, it makes the price tag seem very good value indeed.</span>
