                    <span>This is a great WWII paratroopers book. It is very detailed with the fighting, which i love, but not very emotionally tuned in. His emotions are there, but he doesn't really voice his opinions that much. It's pretty straight forward, but with very good, detailed writing. For anyone who liked David Webster's writing in Parachute Infantry, I wouldn't really recommend this as a must read. It resembles the writing in Band of Brothers, but more personal, less technical, and easier to follow. I personally loved it and can't wait to read his other writings.</span>

                    <span>Horrific depictions of what it was like for the men on the ground.  Burgett's account gives a good glimpse, but civilians like us can never fully experience what it must have been like.  Reads easy; only took two days for me.
<br />
<br />What i didn't like was all the typos i found in my edition.  There were glaring problems with the language and spelling.  One of Burgett's buddies is alternately listed as "Brinninstool" and "Brennenstool."  Not the most efficient editing job...
<br />
<br />Overall, a good piece of memoirs.  Hard to believe no one wanted to read this book when it was originally published.  Must have been way before its time.</span>

                    <span>Just like the real thing, the author tells his story without fanfare.  No Hollywood special effects, music, embellishments, etc., this reads just like you're sitting with Burgett over a cup of coffee and a game of checkers as he recounts the horrors he and his "buddies" went through to rid the world of fascism.  I agree with the other positive things said about this book on his page, so let me let the author speak for himself in a few quick, unforgettable excerpts, as this book has many:
<br />
<br />After breaking his leg on his first practice jump:  "The only way I could travel was to lie on my side, throw the chute forward, crawl to it, and repeat the procedure over and over again.  Finally another jeep came up and this time a sergeant leaned over the steering wheel and said, 'That's the spirit we like around here,' and then drove off.  I crawled for what seemed to be hours."
<br />
<br />On the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, having just dropped behind enemy lines:  "Another plane came in diagonally over the field....then I saw vague, shadowy figures of troopers plunging downward.  Their chutes were pulling out of the pack trays and just starting to unfurl when they hit the ground.  Seventeen men hit the ground before their chutes had time to open.  'That dirty SOB pilot,' I swore to myself, 'he's hedgehopping and killing a bunch of troopers just to save his own ass.  I hope he gets shot down in the Channel and drowns real slow.'"
<br />
<br />War is hell:  "The two German prisoners tried to climb the steep bank behind them, but just as they got to the top, Brininstool fired his tommy gun.  Both of them slid down, whirled around, and were slammed back against the bank so hard by the .45 slugs that their eyes popped out of their sockets and hung down on their cheeks.  What kept them standing is a mystery to me, but neither one fell.  They just stood in a leaning position, side by side against the dirt wall, with arms hanging loosely at their sides.  From the expressions on their faces they must have just looked through the open gates of hell."
<br />
<br />Near the end of his time in Normandy:  "Suddenly a strange smell came to our noses and wisps of a funny looking smoke crept over the hedges from our left.  It clung close to the ground and moved slowly toward us.  Phillips looked back at me.  His eyes were round and wide.  'Gas,' he exclaimed.  'What'll we do now?' 'Nothing,' I said.  'Just stay here and die, I guess.  I wish I had my gas mask now.'  'So do I,' said Phillips and Benson together.  They had been the first things we had thrown away."
<br />
<br />I did not preselect the above excerpts.  I literally spent a very few minutes leafing through the book, finding a striking passage, and typing it for you.  Burgett's experiences are all as rich as the above, about 200 pages' worth in paperback packed with such horrific stories that make one truly appreciate the sacrifices and bravery of such men in that era and, by extension, the current one.
<br />
<br />My only nitpick with the book is that the author several times mentions an event without giving the result; for example, the two paratroopers who got into a drunken knife fight and were taken to the hospital by the MPs.  Their fate is never revealed beyond being taken from the bar, and surely the camp was abuzz with stories about them; for some reason, we don't know whatever became of them.  This is still a five-star book, however, because of the matter-of-fact tone and unmistakeable realism with which Burgett tells his remarkable tale.  Very highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>honestly its been three or more years since i read this burgett book, but it only took me two days to finish it. it just sucks you in and im a very slow reader. burgett is very matter of fact about his training and war time experiences.  from training accidents to killing men so badly burned there was no alternative to relieving them of their suffering. truley powerful.</span>

                    <span>Donald Burgett is one of my favorite authors.  He puts you smack in the middle of the action with his superb writing ability. This book deserves more than 5 stars, so 5 Mega Stars is my rating.  An EXCELLENT read!<p>Dr. Michael L.
