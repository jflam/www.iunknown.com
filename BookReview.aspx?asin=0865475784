                    <span>Riding on the wave of single-ingredient books, this one is a poorly edited but mildly interesting book, mostly about Irish peasantry and how the potato was viewed by its various classes, a subject that the author is so fascinated by that he repeats himself more than once. And other than that, the choice of what to write about and what to just ignore seems to have been made in the most idiosyncratic manner. The history of the potato won't be found, nor its geographical spread and importance in various places around even the western world. As for the Andes, where's that? It must be in the east. As for the premise in the title, it's just a title with nothing to show for it in the book. I wouldn't criticise the author on readability, though. The book is quite readable, just not something to be read otherwise than casually (if you're into reading about Ireland), with the knowledge that the author has points of view that he's pushing. This can't be plain-potato reading. Since the author holds strong views which he pushes here, one needs to read sprinkling the facts and choice of sources with a touch of salt. </span>

                    <span>This is an excellent and insightful history of the potato and the socioeconomic history of food generally in Europe from the 1600's onward. The author had to have spent a mind-boggling number of hours and accumulated mountainous volumes of research to carry this off.
<br />
<br />That said, it is also a somewhat academic treatment -- not in the sense of having footnotes or esoteric jargon, but in the level of detail. While not entirely reader-unfriendly, is not altogether readable either. 
<br />
<br />For reasons not entirely clear to me, the author opted to structure the chapters around England, Ireland, France and the U.S. Although informative and interesting, it lacks a narrative drive that makes one want to continue reading; it lacks a story. There was a chance to build up narrative tension throughout the book by foreshadowing the Irish potato famine, but the author let that opportunity go by the wayside. 
<br />
<br />I found the reader review criticizing the lack of focus on South America to be off-base. That's a topic for a different book. This book is clearly about the potato -- albeit a New World vegetable -- and its rise to acceptance and influences on European and European-derived cultures. </span>

                    <span>Don't let the corny (ouch!) title put you off: this is a serious look at the historical place of the potato in England, Ireland, France and the United States. And if you are concerned that 271 pages on the "humble spud" might put you into a stupor, you might breathe easier when you know that Mr. Zuckerman uses the potato as a starting point to examine lots of other stuff: class distinctions; agricultural landlords and tenant farmers; urbanization; women and domestic drudgery; the role of bread (ouch again!) vs. the role of the potato, etc. Mr. Zuckerman even finds the time, near the end of the book, to incorporate some philosophical musings on the positive and negative aspects of "fast-food" and its relationship to our "hurry-up society." To me, one of the best things about the book was the multi-cultural approach: it was interesting to see how much more quickly the potato caught-on in the United States than it did in France, England and Ireland (where the centuries-old custom of strict reliance on bread had to be overcome). Another interesting thing to read about was the amazement of foreign visitors concerning the variety of the American diet. We tend to forget that in Europe, in the period this book primarily deals with (1700-1900), the average person lived on bread, porridge, and soup. (One of the many interesting facts presented in this book is that up until almost 1900 most French peasants had a morning bowl of soup rather than a cup of coffee.) You were indeed fortunate if you had meat, milk, butter, eggs, coffee, etc. Even if a peasant farmer owned a cow, pig, or chicken, quite often the food products the animals supplied had to be sold, to provide some much-needed cash. The book provides a very nice combination of scholarly data(economic and sociological information) and anecdotal material. To be honest, the book was a "heavier" read than I anticipated, but the interesting "factoids" helped to lighten and liven things up. Some examples: soup was so prevalent in 19th century France that in one district it is documented that some people had wooden tables with rounded depressions carved into them. As Mr. Zuckerman writes, this "removed the need for plates and [also] any doubt about the menu."; soup was also used as a "bread-softener." Due to poor quality grain and inefficient ovens, the crust of bread was often as hard as a rock. Some people couldn't cut the bread with a knife- they had to use a saw; finally, in 19th century London a common sight was the "baked 'tato man," who sold his product from a cart on the sidewalk- similar to today's hot dog, pretzel, and chestnut vendors. But the interesting thing about the "baked 'tato man" was that, in the cold weather, he would suggest to the gentleman-half of a passing couple that he buy a baked potato to keep his sweetheart warm. The author writes, "This advice was often taken, and the potato placed inside her muff." Food for warmth, and this fine book provides much food for thought, as well.</span>

                    <span>This title is an eminently readable social history of the potato's influence in Western Europe and the United States.  It's full of fascinating facts, e.g. innante prejudice about food sources that came out of the ground delaying acceptance of the potato in Europe.<p>The book's greatest strength is the lengthy and sympathetic description of the Irish Great Famine of the 1840's.  I am somewhat familiar with the secondary historical literature of the period and can confidently say that Zuckerman has thorough grounding in the sources and has fairly presented them.<p>There are some problems:  the book could have been better organized, it skips too lightly over the origin of the potato in South America and although it cites sources, a more traditional footnoting style would have been helpful.<p>Mr.Zuckerman, I am now your fan and look forward to reading your next book.</span>
