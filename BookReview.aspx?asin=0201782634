                <span id="Label1"><HTML>One of the most popular Macintosh books ever written, <B>The Mac is not a typewriter</B> has been called the "<I>Strunk and White</I> of typography." Best-selling author <B>Robin Williams</B>'s simple, logical principles for using type to produce beautiful, professional documents are as true now as they were when the original edition was published in 1989.  This updated edition includes new examples and expanded information dedicated to the practical advice that made the first edition an enduring bestseller. Throughout, Robin shows you the small details that separate the pros from the amateurs:  typographer versus typewriter quotation marks, en and em dashes, tabs and indents, kerning, leading, white space, widows and orphans, and hanging punctuation. If you prepare documents, you'll find <B>The Mac is not a typewriter, Second Edition</B> an indispensable guide. And those who read your documents will recognize the work of a pro, even if they don't know a curly quote from curly fries.</HTML></span>

                    <span>The information in this particular book is indispensible to ANYONE who prepares documents for print, whether it is a newsletter, a poster, or a simple business letter. Even things as simple as pointing out how to create an em dash will make all your documents look better. Robin Williams has an excellent writing style that lends itself to repeated readings. She has written many books since, many of which elaborate on the points in this book, but this is still the one I recommend to people who want to know more about type. I gave this book to someone who was producing a school newsletter, and the publication went from ransom note to cohesive publication overnight! If I was teaching a "Word Processing 101" course, I'd use this as the textbook.</span>

                    <span>The reviewer identified as "sonpraises" says: "What is important for the non professional typist to know (use "smart" quotes, don't space twice after a period, italicize instead of underlining, create a long (em) dash by typing shift + option + -) are widely discussed in other places."<P>They are widely discussed because Robin Williams brought them to the world's attention with the first edition of this book. <P>Robin said elsewhere that the Macintosh brought about the greatest revolution in printing since Gutenberg. She was in the forefront of this printing revolution, giving people information once known and used primarily by printers, teaching graphic design and typography to the newly developed industry of desktop publishing.<P>Some day we won't need Robin's book, because people will have forgotten the conventions used on a typewriter to show emphasis and the limitations of a typewriter's keyboard and mono-spaced type, and their computers will automatically provide smart quotes and em dashes. Until then, The Mac Is Not a Typewriter (and its twin, The PC Is Not a Typewriter) needs to be read and shared.</span>

                    <span>Much has changed in the desktop publishing world in the eight years since the first edition of The Mac is Not a Typewriter but the basic rules for creating professional-level type have not. Prolific Mac writer Robin Williams updated her style manual to remind all of us of the importance of proper style in professional and personal communications. With only 80 pages, it is a quick read of common problems and mistakes including line spacing, quotation marks, apostrophes, dashes, underlining, capitals, tabs, spacing, justified text and includes two appendices summarizing rules and shortcuts. Inclusion of the history of typesetting and manuscript styling and her sense of humor transforms a rather dry, textbook-like subject into an interesting and fun read. Who doesn't use their computer to prepare documents? Though the title might not grab the attention of some readers, don't be fooled. Everyone can benefit from this style manual.</span>

Because a Mac and the typographic capabilities built right into it allow you, a regular person to create professional level documents and you need to learn a new set of rules. The typewriter is a horse of a completely different color. This books explains what your Mac can do, how to make your documents better and the rules of the road when it comes to creating much better documents. All in a fun and easy to read way. Enjoy your Mac even more with this book.</span>
