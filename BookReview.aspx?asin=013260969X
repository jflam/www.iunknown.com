                <span id="Label1"><P><B></B> This is a revised version of this volume. Changes in this    edition include: Code has been updated to use ANSI C and the UNIX operating    systems (POSIX). Covers SLIP connections (a popular program that allows TCP/IP    access to the Internet over dial-up phone systems. Latest changes in Network    File System protocol (NFS3). This edition focuses on the BSD version of UNIX.    This volume answers the question &#8220;How does one use TCP/IP?&#8221;  &#8212;    focusing on the client-server paradigm, and examining algorithms for both the    client and server components of a distributed program. <B></B>    Describes the AT&T TLI interface and uses it in all examples. The principles    underlying distributed programs and all server designs are emphasized.    Thoroughly covers the many ways to design interactive and concurrent client    and server software, as well as their proper use and application. Concepts    apply to Client-Server programs in general; not just TCP/IP. <B></B> Any    communications professional who wants to put TCP/IP to use. This is everyone    working on Internet communications.   </P></span>

                    <span>I used this book from cover to cover in a Unix Socket Programming class. A few good points about this book: 1) The sample do compiled on Linux with no problems. That's a plus. 2) The author emphasized good client-server design principles. 3) The introduction is gentle and very readble. 4) The code sample is directly,simple and not riddled with unnecessary details to "show off" like some authors do.<P>You don't need much Unix to do exercise in this book.About the only System calls you need to know are fork(),Select(),sigalarm() and execve(). The book could have been expanded to cover HTTP,SOAP and some other protocols to give it a 5stars.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is very well written. I suspect it was written with college students in mind. As a professional, I went through it like a hot knife through butter. I really liked his showing a number of ways to solve a problem, with a discussion of the tradeoffs (e.g., iterative vs. concurrent servers). The programming is in ANSI C. I enjoyed seeing a makefile and some Bourne shell scripts in this book. So many authors act like this stuff doesn't even exist. You might want to get the UNIX Network Programming, Vol.1, book by W. Richard Stevens also. The Stevens book serves better as a reference and has more detail. E.g., Stevens talks about tcpdump, but Comer doesn't. Yet Comer's book is very easy to read and gives you a clear picture without drowning you in details.</span>

                    <span>If you are a beginer of tcp/ip programming, like me, you will find this book more clear and readable than that by Richard stevens(I have his "Unix programming with TCP/IP" and can make a comparison). The authors give many practical hints and advices which I found very useful. I particularly like the chapter " Practical hints and techniques for unix servers". My only complain is there is not enough description on RPC. If Douglas really want to cover this area, more details should be given. I hope the parts on rpc in this book were as clear as those on socket programming.</span>

                    <span>This is perhaps the best-written technical book I have ever read. I didn't know squat about networking or TCP/IP before I read this book and now I consider myself quite prepared to write client and server applications. Comer and Stevens spare the theoretical and abstract and supply plenty of real-world examples (and code) that make learning the subject enjoyable and effective.</span>
