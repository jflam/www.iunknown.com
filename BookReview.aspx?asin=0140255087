                <span id="Label1">In the autumn of 1973, the writer Peter Matthiessen set out in the company of zoologist George Schaller on a hike that would take them 250 miles into the heart of the Himalayan region of Dolpo, "the last enclave of pure Tibetan culture on earth." Their voyage was in quest of one of the world's most elusive big cats, the snow leopard of high Asia, a creature so rarely spotted as to be nearly mythical; Schaller was one of only two Westerners known to have seen a snow leopard in the wild since 1950.<p> Published in 1978, <I>The Snow Leopard</I> is rightly regarded as a classic of modern nature writing. Guiding his readers through steep-walled canyons and over tall mountains, Matthiessen offers a narrative that is shot through with metaphor and mysticism, and his arduous search for the snow leopard becomes a vehicle for reflections on all manner of matters of life and death. In the process, <I>The Snow Leopard</I> evolves from an already exquisite book of natural history and travel into a grand, Buddhist-tinged parable of our search for meaning. By the end of their expedition, having seen wolves, foxes, rare mountain sheep, and other denizens of the Himalayas, and having seen many signs of the snow leopard but not the cat itself, Schaller muses, "We've seen so much, maybe it's better if there are some things that we don't see."<p> That sentiment, as well as the sense of wonder at the world's beauty that pervades Matthiessen's book, ought to inform any journey into the wild. <I>--Gregory McNamee</I></span>

                    <span>I first read this book while in college but it still resonates for me today as well. What starts out to be simply a journey to far-off Tibet in search of the elusive snow leopard turns out to be also a journey towards understanding--of the death of his wife from cancer, the exotic culture and people of highland Asia, and his relationship to his mysterious guide and friend Tukten. No definitive answers are found to any of these questions but we learn that sometimes it's the quest and not the destination that's truly important.<BR> It transports the reader to a faraway part of the planet but at the same time it shows how our journeys abroad can illuminate<BR>our own lives and uncover parts of ourselves that we don't see<BR>back in our tightly controlled worlds.<BR> This is not a book for everyone's tastes but it is a true<BR>classic in every sense of the word. Read it!</span>

                    <span>The Snow Leopard is about a journey which appears to have only one purpose - to see a snow leopard, but it ends up being about so much more. Humanity, nature and the elements, religion and spiritualism - this book has it all. <P>I read this book only a couple of months ago and could not believe that it was written before I was born! It is so fresh and modern in feeling and context. It also reminds me of another excellent book that I have recently read called Going to Dolpo (writer Timothy Doyle). In both books the author walks into Dolpo in the Tibetan Himalayas, a remarkable accomplishment in itself. Both men are drawn into their own personal Buddhist pilgrimage. Far superior to the usual traveler yarns, I would recommend both these books to the independently-minded reader.</span>

                    <span>if I tell you it has little to do with the snow leopard? It is the quest itself, what it means to quest. "Seek and ye shall find." We're never told what we'll find. To me it is impossible to create a top ten list of books--I love so many--but this is way up there. I plan to read it again and again.</span>

                    <span>After 4 tries I finally finished this book. I have to agree with the 3 other reviewers- there are just too many references to Budhism that left me befuddled. If I wasn't in a foriegn country without other reading material I don't think I would of finished it this time either. My reccomendation is to read it fast and don't even try to make sense of about 20% of the book. Despite this I did enjoy the book but only 3 stars worth.</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for a fifth grade narrative about really neat animals you'd better skip the Snow Leopard. However, if you are ready to take on a great author weaving the physical and the metaphysical together into one of the greatest adventure stories ever written you'll read and always remember this fantastic work of art. It's a tale of exploration that encompasses unbelievable off the map trekking, fascinating research by the greatest living large mammal zoologist, and enlightening insights into the very core of oriental religion. I have never read a book that successfully integrated so much intelligence into one superbly narrated tale. Without exaggeration, it's a classic.</span>
