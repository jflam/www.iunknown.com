                <span id="Label1"><I>Dan Appleman's Win32 API Puzzle Book and Tutorial for Visual Basic Programmers</I> provides 32 challenging programming "puzzles" that will test the skills of any intermediate or advanced Visual Basic programmer.<p> The problems start simply enough, with puzzles that look at the basics of Win32 API C API calls, such as retrieving error messages and graphics. However, the book quickly approaches tougher terrain, offering a series of problems on the Windows Registry. Other problem topics include programming with Remote Access Services (RAS), networked drives, and the DEVMODE structure (for polling printers and other devices). Finally, the toughest problems involve ActiveX programming and cover how to work with Global Universal Identifiers (GUIDs) and drag-and-drop file operations.<p> The back of the book contains hints for each puzzle, as well as complete solutions and comments. The author provides a tutorial on various aspects of VB Win32 C API programming, including C to VB data types, parameter passing (by value and by pointer) and some excellent material on how the call stack works for Windows DLLs. Two final sections discuss the Win32 Service API (for starting and stopping Win32 services) and how to access the Windows NT Event Log.<p> In all, this book provides expert knowledge on getting the most out of VB Win32 C API calls in a format that is always challenging and often entertaining. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>Though I've often seen Appleman quoted as 'the man' I've never shared that opinion. I own the VB5 versions of perplexing and win32 api, and they are useful, but too much of those books come across as a large advert for his company. To do things Dan's way you need these 10 components that he'll sell you...<P>This one is a little harder to blame that way. Me, I like puzzles, so this was too much of a temptation. The layout and content of the book are quite good, I've come across the odd error, but nothing major. Unless of course you were trying to use that particular portion for the demo to the CEO ...<P>This is the book to pick up when you want to rest your brain from the problem you were just working on, not to help fix it, you need either his other books or Pattinson/Kurhana/McKinney etc., but to keep you focus on the problem domain, and let the background thread spin over really solving the problem. <P>This will no doubt help you in future problem solvings, just do not expect to pick it up and go to the index to fix today's bug for the CEO demo...</span>

                    <span>As a VB programmer you should have at least 2 books on yourshelf: Dan Appleman's Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to the Win32 APIand this one. The former teaches by showing - serving as a reference book when you are trying enhance the functionality of your VB application. The latter teaches by doing - allowing your mind to actively grasp the concepts behind API calls, structures, and pointers, instead of mindlessly hacking through APIs, tossing in variables, hoping for success. The puzzles in this book allow you to learn from your mistakes. Mr. Appleman explains his own logic as he works through the problem. For me, this is more valuable than just being told the answer as many books in this genre do. <P>This book is vital to help train a VB programmer to become a designer, rather than a developer. It helps you understand the importance of visualizing the solution to the problem before writing a single line of code. In sports they say that you need to visualize the goal before you actually play the game. I think the same goes for coding. This book is the ideal companion for that exercise. If you are a technical team lead, go ahead and assign these puzzles to your developers so that they can not only hone their skills, but also sharpen their minds.<P>In addition, Mr. Appleman's writing style of light bantering and humor is a nice relief from the dry technical-journalistic writing of other Visual Basic authors.<P>...this book is not a cookbook...it can be better thought of as Ingredient Book. By understanding the fundamental ingredients towards cooking up a VB/WinAPI program, it helps you become a better chef. You need to understand what goes into a creation before you can anticipate what comes out.<P>...this book is not meant to serve as a comprehensive reference guide to the API. For that try Mr. Appleman's API book or Bock's Visual Basic 6 Win32 API Tutorial.. END</span>

                    <span>If you use API's, or want to use API's, then I suggest getting this book.

Definately a "must have" for any programmer out there worth his salt.</span>

                    <span>When I was researching how to access HID-class USB peripherals from VB applications, I learned from the Windows 98 docs that I needed to call a series of API functions to locate the device and learn about its capabilities. Many of the calls involved passing and returning complex structures. I could find no documentation on the calls for Visual-Basic programmers. Although I had some experience with API calls, my initial attempts at calling these functions didn't get far.<P>Then I bought this book. First I read it straight through (though I do admit to reading each solution after the puzzle, rather than waiting til the end). Then I went back to my code with the book at hand and eventually got it all working. Plus, I understood exactly why the code had to be the way it was in order to work.<P>This isn't a cookbook. Thinking is required. One sentence I took particular comfort in when things weren't quite working yet was, "It is ultimately possible to handle any structure, no matter what type of data it contains." (p. 363)<P>This is an excellent and useful book that will enable you to do any API call that Windows might throw your way.</span>
