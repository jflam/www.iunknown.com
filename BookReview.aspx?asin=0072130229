                    <span>This book is for experienced SMS Administrators who want to do so much more with their SMS environment... 911 to me means that this book is your first location to turn when you have problems. The checklists of work flow is invaluable, allowing me to pinpoint problems in SMS within minutes. I'm hoping there will be a second edition of this book when SMS 2003 comes out...</span>

                    <span>I do not consider myself to be an expert Systems Administrator, however, I do operate extremely competently at an intermediate level. I purchased this book in hopes of learning the basics of implementing and supporting SMS2.0. I was sadly disappointed.<P>After reading the other 5-star reviews on this book I was under the impression that this was the end-all do-all text on the subject. When I received my copy what I found instead was a haphazard collection of gotchas, directory hierachy and registry listings. There was not much else in the way of actual instruction to help a SMS newbie master the product.<P>I can see now that the 5-star reviews seem to be predominantly by experienced SMS admins. For them this volume is probably an excellent addition to thier tech library. But for those who desire their first introduction to SMS take my advice, don't walk, run from this one!!</span>

                    <span>If you're looking for an SMS book written by the leading industry leader on the subject, this is it. Rod takes a huge subject and breaks it down into easily digestible text. You can literally sit down with this book and read it in a day -- and retain everything. I learned so many ways to optimize my SMS site with this book, that I had a)never thought of, and b)never thought possible. I refer to this book constantly....this book is a very valuable resource to new and old SMS Admins.</span>

                    <span>I'm an SMS Administrator for 20,000 seats, and this book really blows me away. The logical way it explains troubleshooting and troubleshooting methods is great. And, my SMS site just can't live without the best-practices tips. You can't find this information anywhere else.</span>

                    <span>I've read quite a few books on SMS, but this one seems to go the extra mile. Its not a reference or walk-through guide, because there are plenty of those available. This takes you past the documentation that is already out there. I read it completely through the first day I received it, and can honestly say I know more about SMS before I bought it. It gives you best practices on installing SMS throughout your company, and that was one key thing I couldn't find in other books. Each chapter also has a "checklist" of the SMS 2.0 workflow. I've seen Microsoft's flowcharts and they are confusing. Admin911's workflow checklists show you step-by-step what is going on behind the scenes, and it gives you things to watch out for along the way. Excellent book!</span>
