                    <span>Edward Tufte has his own fan club of people looking on how to present visual information. However, his work is largely on how to present information graphically in print. That's the first mistake of this book, and it's illustrated by Tufte's favorite infographic (not shown in this pamphlet) - the contemporary illustration showing the decimation of Napoleon's troops as they invaded Russia in 1812.
<br />
<br />While this is great way of illustrating a large number of figures, it just doesn't work in PowerPoint. And the reason is that in print, you can expect the reader to pore over one of your points at his own rate, whereas in a presentation you have to present bite-size pieces so that audiences can get the idea immediately.
<br />
<br />Presenters don't even get this basic idea, so don't expect PowerPoint presentations to be good. In fact, there's a cult of "bad is good enough," which makes me wonder how many other facets of doing business would people admit to be "good enough."
<br />
<br />Other "faults" of PowerPoint are shown here. The Gettysburg address as a PowerPoint presentation was manufactured as a joke, so it's hardly a damning indictment of the program. The authors of the NASA slides which downplayed dangers to the Space Shuttle could also have downplayed them in a written report, and probably did. At the meeting where the slides were shown numerous people had concerns, but they felt that any dangers were just brushed aside.
<br />
<br />Until you have a culture of doing better in presentations, no one will be happy. People have no idea how to present giving priority to the message and nothing but.
<br />
<br />Tufte says that presentations are bad, like no one else knew that. But most presenters are in companies that don't value good presentations and make no effort on finding out how to create them.
<br />
<br />Until that culture changes we will always have bad presentations and people complaining about them. </span>

                    <span>If there were a fan club for Edward Tufte, I would gladly sign up to be an officer. His three books changed the way I think about presenting information, and added the invaluable term "chartjunk" to my vocabulary. I was enormously excited to learn that he had written about Powerpoint and could hardly wait to lay my hands on the publication. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait. 
<br />
<br />To those thinking about buying this booklet (28 pages) let me save you the expense by summarizing it:
<br />
<br />PowerPoint slides don't have much information in them, and you're limited to a sequential presentation order. 
<br />
<br />That's about it. His booklet is an extended indictment of the limitations of PowerPoint. Anyone interested in suggestions for Powerpoint improvements will find a refernce on the last page in a postscript to read the third chapter of his book, Visual Explanations, or visit his web site.
<br />
<br />Do that instead of reading this booklet. </span>

                    <span>Tufte is an gifted analyst and communicator, but seems to have taken the easy way out on this publication. He rails against the limitations of PowerPoint, of which there are many, but does not provide much in the way of practical recommendations.</span>

                    <span>After listening to otherwise dynamic sergeants turn into slide-reading zombies during my time in the Army, I couldn't help but laugh out loud as I read Mr. Tufte's book. Even if PP is impossible to escape, this book taught me how to question what I am spoon-fed with it! Kudos to Mr. Tufte for writing such a fantastic critique of such a common public speaking crutch!</span>

                    <span>This is a powerful little booklet which completely transformed the way I think about presentations. Unfortunately, it's also highly repetitive, and stunningly arrogant. The same exact point is made over, and over, and over, and over again. Why? And the arrogance displayed by the author is shocking and unnecessary. For example, the many jabs at Microsoft and other software companies. Tufte should stick to the areas he knows about, and share that knowledge, without venturing into areas he knows nothing about, such as his wide ranging tirade against software companies. It's easy to find plenty of areas in which Tufte could use some education from those very software companies - just try to book a seminar on his web site. It's the worst e-commerce flow I've ever seen. All of that notwithstanding, the booklet has still had a significant and highly positive change in the way I will think about and prepare presentations, and for that, I give it four stars. </span>
