                    <span>I believe I have purchased just about every book covering ASP .NET from Amazon since the inception of .NET.<P>That's a lot of books! Unfortunately, MOST turned out to be real duds or overly simplified - not much good for building real applications and ASP .NET sites. Too many authors were just trying to meet deadlines and produce one of the first books on the subject to hit the market - most are paper weights if anything.<P>This book is by far the best. Leaves the other reads in the dust. This book , however, is not for programmers just beginning .NET programming. It covers many real world applications of .NET and applies real world solutions. I've only owned the book for 4 days and it has already answered many of my lingering questions that the previous books did not cover.<P>Simply THE BEST ASP .NET book out there! I'm not a paid endorsement either. More so a frazzled programmer trying to learn the new platform quickly and apply to projects at my work place. I'm currently building a new LIMS application for the product test lab at my work place. The application is 100% ASP .NET.<P>Where the other books were a disappointment, this book's organization and content display the author's cohesive thought process. His pride in producing a quality book shows through!<P>I look forward to future releases from this author.</span>

                    <span>One of the primary issues with any Sam's Unleashed book is that you have to brace yourself for the disproportionate number of errors. I reiterate the Russell equation here: <P>	Number of Errors = Number of Total Pages / Length of Introduction <P>In other words, the longer the introduction, which includes testimonials from friends, publisher, software companies, the preface, as well as, the author's own introduction, the more the errors there will be in the book. The way I figure it is, if the author and by inference the book needs all that much help by way of an thick introduction it must mean the book has a lot of problems. <P>Stephen Walther, the author of this book undoubtedly knows ASP.NET. The question is not his knowledge of the subject matter, but his ability to communicate the subject and Sam's effort in getting out a quality book. Well in the former category I must admit that Stephen has done a decent job. I am more that halfway through the book I expect that I will be done with it by next Friday. <P>Stephen covers nearly all of the essential ASP.NET controls and he does give some very good examples on the integration of the controls with VB.NET is showing how to present an complete solution. I would wish that Stephen would take an embryonic project and scale it from the ground up showing how a solution might be achieved that speaks to the real world of programming. And not the home user looking for a way to pass a slow weekend.<P>On the point of Sam's effort there is some improvement in the Russell equation. But there are still too many syntactical errors and programming bugs. I have been emailing Stephen and the publisher on a daily basis. I have heard once from Stephen and never from the publisher. I don't really think that Sam's cares all that much for the opinion of it's customers. If they did they would put a good deal of effort into the Technical Reviewing of their books. Which they obviously don't. <P>Lastly, there is a spirited commendation in the inside front cover of the book by some character called Chris Carroll. I suggest that you totally ignore it. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if that person has some economic benefit in writing that commendation. <P>This book is not the end all and be all of ASP.NET books. There will be others I am sure. The one to take the cookie will probably have a short intro and a very tight integration between ASP.NET and VB.NET showing how a real-life project is put together, maybe even a Crystal Reports' report for good measure. <P>This book is not it though, albeit not a bad effort overall. Buy it if like me you must have an ASP.NET right now. If you can afford to wait. Wait !</span>

                    <span>This books is probably the second book to read after Murach's ASP.NET. I would say it's at an intermediate level.<P>I found his writing to be very clear, the examples to be comprehensive if not voluminous. He presents examples you would use in a real application. You will learn the ins and outs of the server controls as well as creating apps for mobile devices.<P>If you know a little about the .NET framework, it's not hard at all to translate the code to C# and to use a code behind file. So I don't have a problem that he didn't use the VS IDE or include C# code examples in the book. The book would have been 2500 pages if he had.<P>For all those who were ranting and raving that Walther didn't use code behind files, I've been hearing that .NET 2.0 may de-emphasize the code behind file. So the author may be farther ahead of the game than most.<P>I liked the two case studies at the end of the book. They bring together a lot of the concepts that are discussed in the earlier pages.<P>The down side of this book is that there isn't much treatment of the VB.NET/C# language. Data access layers and Object Oriented design are glossed over, you will have to learn those concepts elsewhere.</span>

                    <span>This is a must have book for people who wants to start learning ASP.NET. This book talks about each and every detail of what is asp.net, how to use it,what are the different controls..etc, in a clear concise manner,backed with hundreds of working code examples.(there also an online site,where one can refer to the code written in the book..anytime)<P>The author did a great job!!.Before buying this book, I read reviews and was not sure if all the good reviews about this book were true. So, I went to a near by book store to see its contents. I read a couple of chapters and loved it so much that I bought it immediately.<P>For people who are wondering I am a C#/vb.net pgmer, does this book help me?..Yes it does. All the examples in the book are written in both VB.NET and C#.<P>Therez only one thing that I was disappointed a bit. Now a days almost everyone uses VS.NET for .NET development and even though one knows ASP.NET, Learning to use VS.NET is an altogether a different Nightmare.<P>For this there is another book, ASP.NET KICKSTART..by the same author. <BR>I bought these two books and after that never had to buy any .NET book again!!!.</span>
