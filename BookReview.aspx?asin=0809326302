                    <span>As a longtime fan of Japanese baseball, I was thrilled to come across Rob Fitts' book about something I have a real passion for. I had great expectations when I saw it, and would say they were met, if not surpassed. The oral accounts directly by the players themselves put some "flesh on the bone" of my image of Japanese baseball. I enjoyed the humble accounts by Japanese players and marveled at the differences between their style of play and ours. In fact, it was sort of mindblowing to me to hear about the culture and philosophy of Japanese baseball. Had it not been from the mouths of the players themselves, I might not have even believed it! I found the book quite enjoyable, extremely informative, and would not hesitate to recommend it.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>While this book does indeed reinforce some of the ground covered in Whiting's books, it is also the first
<br />english language oral history on the subject and thus it gives a fuller view of how each player saw baseball in Japan than what Whiting could present in his more general overviews. Here you have both Japanese and American players talking about the development of Japanese baseball over the years, how they related to their teammates, who 
<br />would have made it in the major leagues but never got the chance, as well as some personal anecdotes about 
<br />what the families of American players experienced while following their husband or father to the Land of the Rising Sun. At the end of the day, you get a better feel for the humanity of the people who ply their trade on the diamond than in most other baseball books. 
<br />
<br />The only real defect of this worthy work is that one wishes it was longer. It is such a fun and engrossing read that one hopes for a sequel ASAP. Unfortunately, doing oral history is not an easy undertaking (and if you read Whiting's foreward, you will understabnd part of the reason why) and that Fitts was able to get as far as he did with this 
<br />book is a testament to the love and hard work that resulted in its realization.

                    <span>This book reminded me of Lawrence Ritter's outstanding book of baseball reminiscences, The Glory of Our Times--only this time former Japan Pro Baseball players recount their baseball memories.  Nearly all English language books about Japanese baseball published in the past contain either Robert Whiting's well known views about Japanese ball or are very dry books of statistics.  It's fascinating to hear first hand accounts of former stars in Japan talk about their experiences.  
<br />
<br />While the majority of players interviewed for the book are Americans, there are a number of native Japanese players who describe their baseball experiences.  Having read virtually every Japanese baseball book published in English, I can say with some assurance that this is the first time that any nostalgic Japanese player interviews have been published in English.  Of the American players, most have never been interviewed about their time spent in Japan.  
<br />
<br />All in all, this is an informative and enjoyable book which adds new perspective to our understanding of Japan Pro Baseball.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Aside from a few passages, this is merely an expansion upon Robert Whiting's 1980's classic You Gotta Have Wa, which chronicled the experience of American ballplayers in the NPB. Rather than interview  career Japanese players, he elects to interview Americans who played in Japan. This merely expands upon themes discussed in no less than three of Whiting's books, and as a whole adds little to English language analysis of the game. It was disappointing when Whiting broke little new ground in his long-awaited book, and even more disappointing to see another derivative work. For the serious fan only.</span>
