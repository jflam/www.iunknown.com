                    <span>A must-read for Kerouac afficionados. The depiction of his teenage years in Lowell, though sentimental at times, are some of his most beautiful prose; full of sunsets, football and first kisses.
<br />Kerouac-Virgins should check out his 'On the Road' or 'The Subterraneans' first. </span>

                    <span>When thinking of Jack Kerouac the first think you think about is On The Road, or the Dharma Bums. Yet this is a story that has a very personal feel to it. In some ways more so than his other stories. The basic story line is love, love lost and love that got away, yet never forgotten. I'm over simplifying, but that is what it comes down to.  Clocking in at just fewer than 200 pages. Kerouac fits a lot into a short novel. On almost every page you can get a feel of Kerouac have regret for losing Maggie Cassidy.  The true beauty comes from the language that Kerouac uses to describe things and people.  It is really something to read the final time Kerouac and Cassidy meet. It is sad and powerful in the descriptions and the visual images that he gives that give insight to Kerouac more as a person rather than a writer.  This story can best be understood from someone who is "older" in years. I say that in terms of thinking rather than actual age.  Because although I am 25, at the time of this review,  I can relate to the story, yet I am sure that I will relate to the story more as I get older. <p>This is a wonderful story that we can all relate to in some way or fashion. It is wonderful piece lit that is better than some of the garbage I reading my junior year English class, when I was in high school.</span>

                    <span>When Kerouac was good he was superb. This is young love in a glorious, mind-bending nutshell.  Beautifully written and deeply felt.  <p>When I was much younger and had experienced my first brutal betrayal in life, this novel was my greatest comfort. Kerouac had uncanny vision into the human heart, and was capable of expressing the awful paradox of young love, the joy and pain of it, it terms that were never sentimental, and often quietly heroic.<p>A poetic, lovely book.</span>

                    <span>This is my favorite Kerouac novel. This is a beautiful book of life recounted through a teenager's way of looking at things.Through exciting highs and devastating lows, the writing is easy to follow and a moving read. If you're planning to begin reading Kerouac, this is an excellent novel to start with. It has the same emotion without unstructered chapters.</span>

                    <span>Jack Kerouac, writer of many a romantic tale; stories set out wst on roads hitchhiking, listening to jazz till 4 a.m., and just living by the moment, but not this one.  Although it is written in his similar romantic run-on sentenced style that captivates any lover od literature, it's a story about his teen years back home.  Most of it revolving around his love with his girl Maggie Cassidy.  Being a teenager you see connections and dumb teenage stereotypes, that are sad but true.  Stories of drunken New Years with the boys, tales of the track and football team, and mostly that story of love, the "world revolves around us" love.<br>       "The wild windows of other houses and Saturday night parties shining the spilling molen hot gold of real life."  This quote was from Jack's 18th birthday party, where his whole world (family and friends) were all dancing, mingling, and basically having a great time.  This quote describes some of the amazing weekends we have as high school kids, where the fun seems to keep coming at ya.<br>        Stories of high school parties, buddies, girls, drama, and love are all packed into 194 pages; every page telling a new adventure.  Whether it be Jack's short life as a prep school student on a football scholarship, or his first generation French-American parents, or even just his nights with the boys.  Anyone who is or has been enrolled in high school and been involved in the complicated life of a teenager would love this book, so basically everyone.  There's a chapter for everone and Kerouac's characters all have original and meaningful personalities.  When you read it old friends from your town will be remembered, the dialogue and actions of the city kids of the 30's will take you back to the guys and gals you hung out with on weekends.</span>
