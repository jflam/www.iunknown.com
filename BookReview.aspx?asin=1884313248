In addition, there's an illustrated history of pioneering women in motorcycling-from the turn of the century to the high-tech drag racers, stuntwomen, and motocrossers of today-a reference section with safety information, and advice on choosing the a motorcycle and gear. In compiling the book, the author rode more than 30,000 solo miles to interview hundreds of women.</span>

                    <span>Hear Me Roar is a fascinating chronicle of the lives of past and present female motorcycle riders.  The inspiring riders date from the early 1900's to the present, street and race drivers, young and old. Any female motorcycle rider who reads this book will feel proud to be a part of this ongoing history.<p> The practical sections in Hear Me Roar regard safety and risk management, rally information, clubs, and advice on choosing a first bike.  This is a great addition for a person's personal library as well as for a club lending library.  The information in the practical sections is "must reading" for new riders. <p> "Why do I really love this book? Not only because I respect the hard work and sacrifice required to produce it, but because I want a copy for my grandchildren.  I want them to know that I was a participant in the middle years of the struggle to gain acceptance for women in motorcycling. I want them to be proud to know that their grandmother cared about motorcycling and women and that she joined not a group of scuzbags, but a group of interesting, exciting, energetic, on-the-edge women who ventured into a man's world and made it a world for all.  What a concept!"</span>

                    <span>This is the first book of which I am aware that identifies and follows--literally "on the road"--a group of women who have found a sport that is at once an exhilarating physical activity, a mode of transportation, and a recreation that makes its own political statement: I can do it myself! I don't need to cling to the back of a man while he guides the machine through the traffic of the world. I love the way the author, Ann Ferrar, has shown the multi-class, multi-cultural, multi-spirit of the women described here. I love her spirited prose and the photographs she (mostly) made herself. I love the fact that she--a tiny, curly-haired intellectual woman--committed herself to this idea and this project to show the rest of us what we are missing. Read this book, women, then try your wings!</span>

                    <span>When I first saw this book in a bookstore by accident, I called up bookstores all over the city and pretended I needed to order 4 or 5 copies for myself. Why? Because none of the other bookstores had it when it first came out, and I knew if I never showed up to pick up the books I pretended I "needed," they'd have to put the books on the shelves for people to buy. / This is a great and sexy book and you don't HAVE to read it in order (that can be so, so boring).  / My only complaint is that it's an expensive paperback.  I hate expensive paperbacks.  For over $15 I want a book that you can run over, leave out in the rain, and give to a 3 year-old---and still have it look good.  But that's just me.  I'm a cheap son-of-a-b*tch. / Even still, get this book and carry it around with you everywhere for a while. Looking at photos of women on their bikes is inspiring--- like looking at photos of a fat Oprah to inspire you to lose weight. Slowly your life will change and your hair will get wilder... you'll probably think that mini-van you once wanted is oh so silly now, and then later in the week you'll tell your boss to bugger off.  And you won't know why... but I will.</span>

                    <span>When we see a woman on a motorcycle, we can't help but 
wonder who she is, what her life must be like, and what 
makes her ride.  Author Ann Ferrar traveled across the 
 country on her own motorcycle to answer those questions for 
 us.  And the answer vibrates as resolutely as an American 
 V-Twin, crosses boundaries in dual-sport fashion, and powers 
 motorcross style over life's bumps and potholes.
 
 Ms. Ferrar has documented the history, heritage, and heart 
 of women motorcyclists from California to New York.  Not 
 content for this to be merely a lesson of the past, she has 
 captured the essence of current female motorcyclists.  Her 
 final reference chapters regarding choosing motorcycles, 
 gear, training, and camraderie, light a high-powered halogen 
 headlight for our future women riders.</span>
