                    <span>After watching the savvy senior expert Jim Miller on the Today Show, I went to a bookstore to look over his book. On TV, it sounded too good to be true, but after reading some of the book I liked it so well I bought a copy for me and another one for a friend. <P>The book covers the typical topics like social security, medicare and other health related subjects, but it does it in an informative manner that keeps your attention. What I liked were the many other subjects discussed like grandparenting, gadgets for seniors to make life easier, financial tips,taxes,genealogy and computers for seniors. Jim writes in such an easy to read style and I love the humor and helpful websites and organizations to contact. I especially liked the "Savvy Notes" that highlight and summarize the main points.<P>The granddaddy of all is how to find through a central website, where to find out all the benefits available to seniors and how to apply. It's like beingspoonfed the information insead of having to go on a scavenger hunt for it. I loved the book and it lived up to everything the Today Show said and more. I'd give it 10 STARS if I could.</span>

It is never too early to learn about what it is to get older in America. We're all gonna be there, one way or another. Worth every penny.</span>

                    <span>Amazing and incredible!!! The Savvy Senior book is not only easy to read, but also packs a wealth of extremely useful and valuable information on a wide variety of subjects in a simple and understandable manner. There are websites and phone numbers to get help for your own personal situation. I like the sense of humor that makes the book fun to read and keeps boring and dull subjects interesting. This book is a MUST for all senior citizens and their caregivers.</span>

                    <span>I'm a loyal reader of the Savvy Senior newspaper column and found the book to be equally delightful. The service that Savvy Senior provides older Americans is the best information source around. The book is easy to read and very informative with lots of money savings tips and resources so you can find answers to almost everything you want. A great book for every household.</span>
