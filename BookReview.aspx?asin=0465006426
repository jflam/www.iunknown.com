                <span id="Label1">"You will understand Africa differently after reading this book...the richly reported stories he tells to make his case are unforgettable." --William Finnegan.  <P>Since 1983 journalist Bill Berkeley has traveled through Africa's most troubled lands--Rwanda, Liberia, South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, and Zaire--seeking out the tyrants and military leaders who orchestrate seemingly intractable wars. Shattering the myth that ancient tribal hatred lies at the heart of the continent's troubles, Berkeley instead holds accountable the "Big Men" who came to power during this period, describing the very rational methods behind their apparent madness.  <P>A <I>New Republic</I> Book</span>

                    <span>Bill Berkeley has taken an unpleasant subject and poured his life time's work into this examination of evil and distilled it into this well done book, The Graves are Not Yet Full (Race, Tribe and Power in the Heart of Africa). The author has earned the right to tell these stories and does well by them as a journalist. He concentrates on the Big Men, the tyrants whose personalities are behind the anarchy and slaughter in Africa, and shows how the situations are manipulated by these men (and this includes, pointedly, a representative of the United States in the chapter on the assistant secretary of state) to maintain their persoanal power at the expense of the people of whom they are responsible. It is frightening story and, despite the author's small ray of hope added at the end, seemingly impossible to change. This is a great book for those who want to see the situation in Africa beyond the meager news reports of victims and villians.</span>

                    <span>Although I share Berkeley's concern for the people of Africa, in my opinion he is way to eager to prove an initial thesis - that Africa's basic problem is "outside" influence. Like many young idealists who care passionately about their cause, Berkeley is highly selective about what is included in the book, although he does make an admirable effort to give targets of his criticism an opportunity to state their case (no small concession).<P>Over one-third of the book - nearly 100 pages - is devoted to Liberia, a tiny country with less than three-tenths of one percent of the continent's population. The reason for this is that it is simply not chic to criticize the West unless you can find some way of demonizing the U.S. in the process. This is hard to do in the case of Africa, since the U.S. was never a colonial power there, but Liberia is a country in which the U.S. has had a special interest over the years, which makes it a juicy target. It doesn't hurt that Liberia's worst problems began just as the Reagan administration was being installed, although connecting the dots becomes a bit of a stretch (Berkeley criticizes the U.S. both for supporting the Doe regime in 1986 and then failing to support the regime three years later).<P>This touches on the main problem with the book, namely that it is a long litany of skin-deep complaints without any exploration of alternatives. Certainly it is easy to criticize the U.S. for supporting the kleptocratic Zairian dictator Mobutu, but how would the country have been any better without Mobutu? Zaire would most certainly have fallen under Soviet influence (if not outright anarchy) and, as we see in places like Guinea and Ethiopia, this would not have been any better for the people or the economy. Failure to hold the line in the Third World would simply have prolonged the Cold War, and the Marxists were far less supportive of human and political rights than was the West. <P>Berkeley does not mention any Communist countries or African disputes that fail to fit the model, such as that between the Shona and Matabele. His foray into South Africa is an amazing piece of gerrymandering that manages to portray the ANC as a victim of Inkatha aggression. He accomplishes this by focusing only on the Natal area, an Inkatha stronghold in "Zululand." Tough questions are put to the Inkatha leadership on the violence in their district, yet there is no mention of what was happening in the rest of SA. ANC atrocities, such as the Shell House and St. James's church massacres, are neatly sanitized from Berkeley's version of events. One wonders if he ever heard of the Black Consciousness movement and why it no longer exists in SA.<P>Perhaps instead of trying to fit Africa into a politically correct clich√©, Berkeley would have done better to challenge his own preconceptions and educate the reader in the process. There is no harm in providing the total picture, but a dedication to do otherwise, simply for the purpose of influencing the audience, insults those who feel that they can be trusted with the true details of a complex situation.</span>

                    <span>This book is a stunning and gruesome portrait of genocide in Africa. Reporter Bill Berkely travelled to the war zones of Africa to meet the victims of racial violence and the inflictors of such violence. Berkeley's focus is more on the criminals and their actions that effect their nation. The interviews and experiences Berkely had with these evil individuals are fascinating and terrifying. If you have never come into real and forceful evil, you should read this book and learn what is going on on the other side. It is also good to be informed on this subject so that help can be given where it is needed.</span>

                    <span>This book tells a story of Africa, its despots, and rapacious westerners who have been accomplices in the wars and barbarism that continue to plague the "dark continent". No American president in recent history is without guilt. Clinton realized too late that not enough was done to stop the genocide in Rwanda. However, Reagan and others not only did nothing to stop the horrors but befriended and even aided heads of state as the latter savagely slaughtered their own people.<P>The bottom line: greed and the fact that in 3rd world nations, if you remove one despot, another will quickly fill the void.<P>This book is shocking but will enlighten you about what continues to happen in these nations. The worst sin is when we benefit from this suffering. You will see in this book that we have benefitted on several occasions.</span>
