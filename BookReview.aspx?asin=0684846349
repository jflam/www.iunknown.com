                    <span>This book is excellent.  You can skim the technical stuff and still get a sense of what Candace Pert is saying to us.  She describes her journey which starts as a hard, empirical scientist working in academia, National Institute of Health and National Institute of Mental Health.  Here, only an objective, distant, male-oriented view of the world was accepted.  She eventually evolved to embrace and celebrate the importance of feminist view in science and to see the mind, body, and spirit connection.  She provides a scientific basis for the ideas that some would call "far out".  These ideas seem far out only to those who have not ventured far.</span>

                    <span>After watching the movie "What the Bleep..." where the author of this book is featured, I felt like reading some more about the bio-chemical nature of our emotions.  I found this book inspirational in that it's largely autobiographical.  Much of the book is written in the first person where Dr. Pert talks of her trials and tribulations in a male dominated area.  She talks of people who helped her tremendously and others who tried to steal her fame and cut her down (as well as some who actually did).  I think many people think that hard work alone will get them where they'd like to go in life.  But nothing could be further from the truth.  As illustrated in this book, so much depends on who you know, who likes you, and who's willing to help you.  There is no question in my mind that Candice Pert is a brilliant scientist.  But I seriously doubt if she could have discovered the opiate receptor had she not met certain key people in her life.  
<br />
<br />In light of the recent talk about women being inferior scientists than men, this book is a must read for young women interested in going into the sciences.  Candice Pert pulls no punches and tells it like it is.
<br />
<br />Chapters 7 through 9 were the most informative and thought provoking to me.  There is a wealth of information on how our emotions are mere results of chemical peptides latching on to receptors of cells in the body.  Our emotions are also mechanisms for activating certain neuronal circuits.  When certain neuronal circuits are activated, the mood or feelings we have can facilitate certain memories associated with that mood or feeling.  This is called state dependent recall or dissociated states of learning.  After reading this, I asked myself whether or not certain memories or things which remind us of certain experiences can evoke certain moods, feelings or behaviors.  After reading more and thinking about it, I see no reason why not which is interesting because that gives a strong basis for such things as snap judgements and "instincts".      </span>

                    <span>Candice Pert offers an incredible analysis of the moment-to-moment creation of our reality based on emotional states. When emotions change our chemical make-up it is incredible what can happen in our physical bodies and relationships. Some things we can't control, some things we can, and the grace to know the difference is probably the best thing about this book. Molecule of Emotions offers a distinction in how we can master our lives through emotional well-being and wellness.</span>

                    <span>Take a few doctors of medicine and philosophy, the worlds of academia and laboratory science, the heated race for a discovery with the potential for Nobel Prize status, weave them artfully together and lo, you've got a page-turner that reads like The DaVinci Code.  
<br />
<br />Though I was willing to slog through a dry scientific tome, this book manages to make the world of molecules, peptides and receptors accessible. The added tales of pettiness, rivalry and politics among scientists (author included) seeking to unravel microscopic mysteries gives the book a very human dimension. 
<br />
<br />The film What the Bleep Do We Know? led me to Molecules of Emotion.  Ordinarily, I don't seek books based in traditional science but I was fascinated by Dr. Candace Pert, who appeared in the film, and her work with the mind-body connection.  
<br />
<br />Pert's book charts her personal and professional journey beginning in 1970 as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University. Her early work aided in the discovery of endorphins. Later, when she was passed over for a prestigious pre-Nobel prize, she challenged her mentor for the recognition she felt she deserved, an act of hubris with far-reaching results in her own, and many of her colleagues', professional lives. Pert is humbled and transformed by her experience.
<br />
<br />Because the chemicals of emotions are intimately connected to vitality, Pert's work points to the importance of the mastery of emotions. Her contribution to science demonstrates what she calls "bodymind'" intelligence and the power we all have for health without costly drugs and high-tech medicine. Also of interest in understanding emotions and overcoming superficial and addictive relationships are Ramtha's books, That Elixir Called Love and Gandalf's Battle on the Bridge.
<br />
<br />Perhaps a little short on hard science for some, Molecules of Emotion offers plenty to the student of life.
