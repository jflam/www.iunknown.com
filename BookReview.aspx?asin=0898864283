                <span id="Label1">The world's first national park remains a premier destination for enjoying the great outdoors with the entire family. Unequaled wildlife viewing opportunities and Old Faithful's clockwork blast continue to delight young and old alike. The park's many rivers and lakes allow access to some of the most pristine and scenic water for teaching the kids how to fish, and on a good day the native--but sometimes guileless--cutthroat trout can be as obliging as fish in a barrel. Large mammals such as mule deer and elk are almost certain to be viewed along the way.<p> <I>An Outdoor Family Guide to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks</I> provides both practical advice and trip destinations with the whole family in mind. Tips on hiking, biking, and paddling with children will lower the odds that you'll end up with an exhausted, unhappy, or hurt child. For example, the Two Ribbons Trail, a very short loop leading to the Madison River and its adjacent meadows, is a great way to introduce young trekkers to the wonders of self-propelled travel. An overview chapter lists visitor centers and museums, and provides specific information on how to access myriad activities--climbing, horseback riding, boating, rafting, and mountain biking--within the parks. The rest of the book offers detailed hiking descriptions, each beginning with at-a-glance details (difficulty, distance, usage, and elevation gain) to help you discern which trails are appropriate for you and your young hiker. For instance, if you'd like to explore geothermal activity at a leisurely pace, choose the Artist Paint Pots trail (rated "very easy") to view these "strange-colored pools and a huge, spitting, burping mud pot." Detailed maps and a smattering of photographs add to this high-quality guide.  </span>

                    <span>This may be a great book for summer Yellowstone adventurers, but there is nothing mentioned about the beauty of Yellowstone during the winter.  So, basically it was worthless and a waste of $$.  We just got back from a winter snowmobiling tour, and it was amazing.  I would suggest the Moon Handbooks - Yellowstone - Grand Teton National Parks...</span>

                    <span>Lots of good information in this book really helped prepare us for our trip to Yellowstone.  Hike information was great and even pointed out when certain trails opened.  This was very helpful in planning since we were traveling in May before many trails were open.</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book and several others for my trip to the Tetons and Yellowstone.  This book was very informative on lodging, trails,  sightseeing and travel. This guide was a time saver as well giving me ideas  of the trails and difficulty and estimated time.  Many things to do and  lots of recommendations for children but its so much more.  Definately a  keeper and will use next time im planning a vacation to the area. Oh by the  way, i do recommend a trip to the Tetons and Yellowstone. The tetons were  breathtaking and definately do the trip accross Jenny Lake.  Yellowstone,  WOW the gysers, wildlife, fishing it was terrific.  Have Fun.  Jeff</span>

                    <span>We used this guide almost exclusively during our recent 2 week trip. We took about 7 hikes from the book and we found them to be very accurately described by the author. We were able to find hikes that worked for the  whole family. Great book if you plan to travel with kids.</span>

                    <span>This was the best book out of three that we purchased. This book is equally good for singles, couples, or families - so don't let the title mislead you. In addition to the great hikes, it also describes several  other types of trips - like row boating on Colter Bay in the Tetons. It's  well organized and includes good maps and descriptions. I highly recommend  this book for anyone planning a trip to Yellowstone and Grand Tetons.</span>
