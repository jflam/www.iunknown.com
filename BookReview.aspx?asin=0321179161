                    <span>The author clearly states in the introduction the book is intended for new Freehand users. One of the previous reviews, stating it is unfit for power users, is probably correct; but that is not the intent of the book. Based on that, this book accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: acquaint new users to Freehand. I thought it did a very good job. Additionally, the Freehand manual actually is shipped with the CD. It is located on the installation CD in .pdf format.</span>

                    <span>As a professional who earns my income using Photoshop I was looking for help learning Macromedia Freehand MX.  I understood that Freehand, similar to Photoshop is NOT intuitive. <br>Patti Schulze wrote and organized a "how to book" that enables the reader to reach their goal--learning Freehand MX.<br>The book is written in an understandable style that anticapated my questions. For example; while moving a rectangle to center it on the guides on the page, I was to drag and center the rectangle by placing the X that would appear in the center of the rectangle over the proper position on the guides.  My problem was there was no X in the rectangle. The very next paragraph anticipated my question and gave the answer.<br>The success of your goal--learning Freehand MX takes effort on the readers part but the author has successfully done his job.</span>

                    <span>Training from the source barely scratches the potential of Freehand MX, although it does a good job at getting a user up and running.  Power Tips scattered throughout the book are a nice feature, but not much use to a Power User.<p>Since Macromedia has stopped shipping full manuals with Freehand MX, this title suffices as a manual, but not for people who are interested in the inner workings of Freehand, or even ideas on real world usage, and powerful insider tips to using Freehand effectively.<p>The name of the title, "Training from the source" just raises your expectations and this book leaves you expecting more.</span>
