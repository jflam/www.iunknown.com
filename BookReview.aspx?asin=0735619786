                    <span>In this book Microsoft , takes you all the way from explaining the basic concepts of  mail servers and move on to installing, upgrading, migrating and clustering of exchange servers and in a very detailed way with many pictures that helps you understand the product even if you didn't work with it before.
<br />Readers can notice easily the improvements in the MS books released for 2003 products over the ones released before for 2000/NT.
<br />Reading this book will help you for sure do the daily tasks of exchange administration, installing, upgrading, lists, aliases and much more, if you are considering this book for clustering and for advanced recovery techniques you will be disappointed.
<br />Worth reading.

                    <span>Another fine Pocket Consultant from William Stanek. Clear, Concise, and encyclopedic in scope. This "Pocket" book is designed to serve as a reference for common and not so common procedural tasks. It is also great for learning Exchange. I used this book to get Exchange up and running in minimum time. As with most of his other "Pocket" references, Mr. Stanek does a very thorough job of documenting tasks in a highly organized manner. You will get more out of this book in a few days than you will combing the newsgroups for months and months. I haven't found a daily administration question this book didn't answer. I keep a copy in my backpack so I have it always with me. This is a book you will find yourself referring to on a daily basis. With Amazon dropping the price by 30%, it is a deal that cannot be beat! Very highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>Exactly what I was looking for...focuses on Exchange essentials and does an excellent job. I was pleasantly surprised how well written. I'll look for Stanek's books from now on when I need an Exchange reference.</span>

                    <span>If you use Exchange, you need this book. Period. All the new 2003 features are covered. Beginners will find everything they need to get going, while experienced admins will find things they didn't know. (For example, why and how you set RTS values for the X.400 MTA or to configure Outlook Mobile/Web access for firewalls in multiserver configurations).<p>The book even teaches configuring mail support for Outlook and Outlook express. Everything from IMAP to POP3 configuration, accessing multiple mailboxes, delegating access permissions. <p>I'm an die-hard GUI hacker, and the book discusses that, but also goes deep into the details. The books gives pointers on mobile access, web access and all the related wireless issues. It even discusses RPC over HTTP. The most detailed discussion on the data store I've found. Everything you'd expect on storage groups, mailbox stores, public stores, content indexing, replicating public folders.<p>This is an excellent book and I recommend it very highly.</span>

                    <span>I have ordered several manuals for Exchange Server 2003. I haven't found a question yet that Stanek's "Pocket Consultant" hasn't addressed fully. The index (20 pages!!!) has actually had an entry for every single hitch I've come up against. I've been able to solve problems left and right that the other manuals I got didn't help with either! <p>This is a technically direct and accessable reference that will even give you the "why-and-how-it works". And besides that, it's clear and easy to follow! William Stanek has a long history of writing books with a clear and easy to follow style. You get high tech, direct help with ease of use and enjoyable reading. Who could ask for more? I'm recommending it to every Exchange user and admin I talk to! <p>If you really want to get it done, and you're only getting one manual, go with this one. It's incredibly well written, jam packed full of useful help, appropriately detailed, and best of all, it will actually get used!!!</span>
