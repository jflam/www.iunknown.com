                <span id="Label1"><P> In an era of Hollywood icons, no star shined brighter than Audrey Hepburn. Her charm, her grace, her frail humanity and, of course, that stunning face delighted moviegoers across the world. On-screen and onstage she dazzled millions as Gigi, Eliza Doolittle and Holly Golightly. But to her son Sean she was simply "Mummy." <P> In the first insider portrait of Audrey Hepburn, Sean Hepburn Ferrer offers an intimate glimpse into the life of Hollywood's most celebrated actress. In this emotional and candid memoir, Sean tells his mother's remarkable story, from her childhood in war-torn Holland to the height of her fame to her autumn years far from the camera and the crush of the paparazzi. It is a rare look at Audrey not from the photographer's lens, but through the eyes of the son who adored her. <P> <I>Audrey Hepburn, An Elegant Spirit</I> features nearly three hundred photographs, documents and artwork by Audrey herself, many of which have previously been unavailable. In this unprecedented memoir, Sean Hepburn Ferrer remembers the actress the world adored as only a son can. <P> More than a Hollywood biography, <I>Audrey Hepburn, An Elegant Spirit</I> is about the relationship between a son and his mother. Sean introduces us to an Audrey who was as profoundly sad as she was beautiful. Helpless to change the cruelties of the world and powerless against her own insecurities, Audrey was a devoted mother to Sean -- "my best friend," he calls her -- and his brother, Luca. And when they were older, they were proud to see their mother use her fame to help the children of the world who were in need. As the spokeswoman for UNICEF, Audrey brought worldwide attention to the tragic lives of millions of impoverished children.</span>

                    <span>Sean Hepburn Ferrer was raised by an angel. "Audrey Hepburn: An Elegant Spirit" is a loving and fascinating tribute to the humanitarian and actress, written by one of the people who knew her best-her oldest son. Mr. Hepburn Ferrer generously shares stories and images of Audrey's humor, charm, grace, empathetic world outlook and incredibly caring nature. I've read several Audrey biographies, and this book is by far the best, but it functions more as a poem than a traditional bio. We see Audrey's life filtered through the primary modes of 20th century pictorial representation (bureaucratic, celebrity photography, family snapshots), then refracted back through her son's recollections and impressions.<P>Within the book's pages are Audrey's lifetime of passports-these "papers" can be a chilling reminder of the obsession for national identification within the Europe she was born into, but they also optimistically mark her transformation into a citizen of the world. Family photographs reveal a woman consistent with her onscreen persona, and Audrey's elegant, delicate lines cut straight through the intimate and public realms. In pictures of her gorgeous garden in Switzerland and in images of her work for UNICEF, we witness her mission to imagine the world as it could be, and her tireless efforts to make it so.</span>

                    <span>The different accounts that Sean Hepburn-Ferrer's has shared with us are touching, private and intimate and give a true picture of the amazing person Audrey Hepburn was. <P>I began to read the book one evening before bed, I planned to read a few pages and then go to sleep. I couldn't put the book down. I read until I couldn't stay awake a moment longer, finishing the book when I woke up later that morning.<P>The 300+ photographs complimented the book perfecty. The addition of photographs from the family album only made the book more special.<P>Although I would have dearly loved to have been able to read Audreys autobiography, her premature death prevented that. I am so pleased that her son was able to write this book for her.<P>One point: If you re after a detailed biography, this is not what this book is. However after reading a biography, I would recomment this book.<P>Audrey Hepburn is certainly "An Elegant Spirit".</span>

                    <span>Describes Audrey exactly, puts into words how I feel watching her on screen. She was more than a great actress, she was a presence that touched you, and her elegance and grace was more than the outside, it was something that radiated from within, and her son does a fantastic job acknowledging that, helping us, her fans, understand a little better. I have been captivated by Ms. Hepburn my whole life, and have read almost everything out there but none of her biographies have touched me, and done real justice to her like this one. I feel this is the way Audrey would want to have been remembered, as if she were there as her son wrote it. My respect and admiration for Audrey Hepburn has increased dramactically through the reading of this book and I treat my loved ones better, and enjoy life more through her great wisdom and courage. I love this book! It has great pictures also and is a delightful read, he has real talent!! Thank you so much for writing this book and all the love that went into it!</span>

                    <span>Too bad there are not more people in the world like Audrey. There will never be another. The most beautiful women in the world, and the reason is because she was even more beautiful inside. A terrific read. Tells more about her UNICEF work. Loved the book - the pictures are wonderful. This book is much like Audrey, a beautiful cover on the outside and the contents are wonderful with beautiful pictures and a beautiful story. This is one book I plan to keep always. Other books I give to others to read, or trade them at a half price book store, but this one is a keeper.</span>
