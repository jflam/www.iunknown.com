                    <span>The book is inventive, not pedantic, and its suggestions help produce energetic writing. I believe even published writers could benefit from it. Its four hundred and ten pages divide into two parts: pruning sentences and using creative language. What the author calls "dimwitticisms" include some foreign phrases, grammatical gimmicks, ineffectual phrasing, redundancies, moribund metaphors and much more. Use the book to weed out the unnecessary so you will say more with fewer words.</span>

                    <span>In a world where writers advise others to forget vocabulary and go for clarity, I felt left out. No doubt, I agree - clarity is important. But using smaller words where better ones could be used - is that really the way to go? After all, aren't writers supposed to use big words so that we, the normal mortals could learn through their usage; improve our vocabulary through the extravagant use of the words we wouldn't dare use in front of others?
<br />
<br />This book is a delight not just for writers, but anyone who wishes to communicate in more sophisticated language. The author correctly points out that you are what you say and write. If you can speak and write with class, you project class. In his quest for achieving excellence and making sure others do too, the author has compiled more than 5000 overused words and phrases and lists alternatives to them. 
<br />
<br />The book gives various alternatives for words that you commonly use and so do a million other people. For you to stand apart from the crowd (a moribund metaphor), you need to make your words roll of the speaker's tongue. Make speaking or reading each word a delight, a new experience and your writing will be much more vivid, sophisticated and a lot more mature.
<br />
<br />"The Dimwit's Dictionary" is a tool for weeding out unwanted words and phrases. Keep it handy as a reference when you write and see your writing rise into a class of its own.

                    <span>The title itself is more than just a little self-righteously pedantic, and the language used within often reflects the title. However, the contents are an excellent reference tool for anyone interested in sparking up their writing.
<br />
<br />Cliché's, misplaced metaphors, and other identifications made by Fiske occur too often in published books. I personally use this (along with its relative companion, The Dictionary of Concise Writing) with regularity, and have caught myself more than once using language that could use some freshening up.

                    <span>Fiske has written a strange book indeed.  Its primary purpose would appear to be the dissemination of an idea that with Fiske somehow dim-wittedness can be removed from your language.  Alas, his identification of so-called grammatical gimmicks, ineffectual phrases, moribund metaphors, wretched redundancies, and the like is seldom shared by well-known language critics such as R.W. Burchfield, Bryan A. Garner, and William Safire. 
<br />
<br />That said, he does tend to identify weak and rummy phrases. However, instead of suggesting ways of strengthening such phrases to unassailable idiomatic expressions, Fiske suggests their deletion or single word replacements, which tend to be as queer and eccentric as they are gestures of ill-will and contempt for English idiom and its admirers.</span>

                    <span>'Manglish' ~ the act of mangling the English language ~ is sadly alive and thriving in the world. And many writers aren't helping just adding to the growing trend of misspellings, tautologies and clichés as well as hackneyed metaphors, inane expressions and bloated or weak writing. <p>Fortunately, help is at hand. Robert Hartwell Fiscke has produced two powerful, literary weapons for protectors of the language ~ The Dimwit's Dictionary: 5000 Overused Words and Phrases and Alternatives to Them and The Dictionary of Concise Writing: 10,000 Alternatives to Wordy Phrases.<p>The key to good writing, according to Fiske who is also the author and publisher of The Vocabula Review (an online journal about the English language), is concise and precise writing ~ and that's just what he offers with these two excellent reference books.<p>At first glance, you may be offended by the Dimwit's title ~ what person would buy a book which suggests he or she is a dimwit? Well, after leafing through it, you'll know why you bought it and maybe even refer to some of your past efforts as dimwit. I know I did.<p>The 400-page book is divided into two parts. The first examines a wide range of examples of lazy and weak writing, showing scribes how to improve useage through better word choices and creativity with the language.<p>Part two is the dictionary portion of the volume. It offers literally an A to Z guide of thousands of overused words and phrases, and provides fresh alternatives.<p>As Fiske explains from the outset: "Dimwitticisms are worn-out words and phrases; they are expressions that dull our reason and dim our insight, formulas that we rely on when we are too lazy to express what we think or even to discover how we feel. The more we use them, the more we conform ~ in thought and feeling ~ to everyone else who uses them."<p>The book arranges dimwitticisms into a variety of categories which include:<p>* Foreign phrases<br>* Grammatical gimmicks<br>* Ineffectual phrases<br>* Inescapable pairs<br>* Infantile phrases<br>* Moribund metaphors<br>* Overworked words<br>* Plebeian sentiments<br>* Popular prescriptions<br>* Quack equations<br>* Suspect superlatives<br>* Torpid terms<br>* Withered words<br>* Wretched redundancies<p>Often entertaining and always enlightening, The Dimwit's Dictionary demystifies English usage, providing a simple-to-use guide on what words and phrases to avoid and how to adopt an exciting, original and succinct approach to your writing.<p>But don't be fooled by the title ~ this book is not only an excellent reference guide, it's also interesting enough to read cover to cover. Once you begin reading entries, you'll find it difficult to put down - seriously.<p>-- Michael Meanwell, author of the critically-acclaimed 'The Enterprising Writer' and 'Writers on Writing'.
