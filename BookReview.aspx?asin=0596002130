                    <span>I've been reading kernel books for nearly 20 years -- this is not recommended.
<br />
<br />Some of the chapters and explanations I liked, others I felt were dry and lacking.   The code examples seem to run through a non-deterministic preprocessor -- the code is supposed to describe 2.4.18, but the code snippets don't quite match the actual code (while generally working the same way, the algorithms/loop structure are often rewritten and the macros are sometimes expanded).  I find it very useful when books comment on actual code examples, this is "kinda massaged code" -- I found it very frustrating when I actually looked at the kernel tree when they had snippets in the book.
<br />
<br />I often found it necessary to look at the actual code to give more context (but the code rarely matched verbatim -- very strange).  And when they did rewrite algorithms, I found the  kernel 2.4.18 source to be MORE lucid.
<br />
<br />The explanations without code were adequate, and I found some to be illuminating.  Perhaps since the book has two authors, different authors wrote different chapters?  (I liked some chapters and didn't like others).
<br />
<br />If you want a general understanding of how kernels work, Andy Tanenbaum's "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation" where he elaborates on Minix is very useful -- with a complete Minix system (Minix is more of a teaching tool, which it does well, Linus looked at lMinix and wanted a more useful system, hence Linux).
<br />
<br />I found Robert Love's "Linux Kernel Development" very good (I read the 1st edition, still need to read the second edtion).  And Linux Device Drivers (Corbet and Rubini) is very good and has excellent examples (but the examples may need some work to build on a current kernel -- had this problem with the 2nd edition).</span>

                    <span>If you read and understand most of what is in this book, then you will be an expert on the internals of the Linux kernel. This book goes into great detail on all aspects of the kernel. I would recommend this book, as well as "Linux Kernel Development", to be used as supplements to a college course taught on operating systems  where Linux is used as a reference OS implementation. 
<br />
<br />The book does a good job of making complicated concepts accessible, but the reader may need to noodle over some concepts a bit more than others in order to fully grasp them. This, however, doesn't take away from the pedigogical nature of the book.</span>

<br />     If you are interested in OS design, or intend to work with the Linux
<br />Kernel, Understanding the Linux Kernel is a very useful look into how
<br />and why certian decisions were made in the Linux kernel.  This book
<br />doesn't seem to leave anything out.  Example code is used very well to
<br />show exactly what the authors are talking about.  This would be an
<br />excellent book for a course on OS design.
<br />     The second edition doesn't cover the 2.6 kernel,
<br />which wasn't out at the time the book was published, but it still 
<br />provides a great resource for kernel information.

                    <span>I am CS student and I had been confused by my OS textbooks with bunch of abstract block diagrams, pseudo codes, and implementation examples on different hardware platforms. I know OS handles interrupts, uses locks, manages process, do file-IO caches, but I want to have a clear picutre of how these really work together. I try to dig Linux kernel code by myself but only finds more questions and frustrations. This book helps me at this point. It describes x86 hardware (which unfortunately not well taught in my CS architecture class), illustrate data structures and code so I can trace code way much faster. It's a book to HELP you understand the Linux kernel (or a real working kernel than those obsolete/only_avaiable_in_super_computing_center ones in the old OS textbooks). If you are already a super OS programmer or C/asm hacker you don't need this book cause you may know things faster by reading the source. You can't use this book to learn the philosophies of OS design, nor can you understand the kernel detail without actual code trace. It may not be up-to-date for a weekly-refreshing software (which book can?), but once you learn the gory details, tracing the changes is piece of cake.</span>

                    <span>A very decent book on Linux Kernel v2.4. Based on PC 80x86 architecture, it covers both uni- and multi-processor systems. Very detailed, explains not only how kernel works but also why it was designed this way. <p>This is an exciting book for anyone seeking advanced insides into Linux Kernel. I rated it 4 for lack of clear separation between Linux and hardware responsibilities. I also wish the author would have conducted a comparison study with Windows, another POSIX-compliant OS.</span>
