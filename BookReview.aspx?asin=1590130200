                    <span>A really invaluable referance guide to the sport of boxing.  If you are a real afficiando of the sport or like myself, just a casual fan it doesn't really matter.  This book has all the information that you could want.  All the champions from the various weight classes are here.  Each boxer has a record of all of his fights, and a (surprisingly) entertaining overview of his career.  Wether you are checking out a specific fighter for a specific fight, or just want a few moments of reading.  This is the book for you.  From the heavyweight super stars that we all know, to the 98 pounders that could tear the most 'macho' of us apart before breakfast, this guide has them all.  Informative and VERY intertaining.  But it, read it, and revel in the history of the "manly art"  You won't be dissapointed.</span>

                    <span>The authors and the International Boxing Hall of Fame based in Canastota, NY deserves a lot of credit for this excellent contribution to boxing - "the sweet science". This is a treasury chest of information on boxing history, fighters records and inside stories in a handy book format with lots of great photos and illustrations. Whether you want to know about the sanctioning bodies or the weight divisions, the records or the biographies of the fighters inducted into The Hall of Fame, you will find it all right here. <p>Content data, records and biographies about the fighters are divided in three main sections: 1- the early pioneers from bare knuckle brawlers to the Boston Strong Boy; 2- the old timers when the sweet science becomes an American passion; and 3- the modern era when boxing waxes and wanes but the grear stars shine. Names like James Figg, John L. Sullivan (The Boston Strong Boy), Max Baer, Jack Dempsey (The Manassa Mauler), Jack Johnson (the first african-american heavyweight champion from 1908-15), Gene Tunney, Joe Louis, Archie Moore, Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali (The Greatest) and many other great fighters, they are all here. You will also find information about boxing's supporting cast with names like Gil Clancy, Cus D'Amato, Angelo Dundee, Lou Duva, Don King, Arthur Mercante and others. Additionally, there are short essays on the governing bodies ruling the sport, the seamy side of boxing scandals, the influence of television in the sport, etc. <p>In conclusion, this is an outstanding source of reliable information on boxing as well as on individual fighters in a handy, manual, illustrated book format for a very reasonable price.</span>
