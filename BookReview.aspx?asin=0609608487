                    <span>We read the gushing Robert M. Parker Jr. quote on the cover, "A terrific and candid guide to the wines of Italy that should be on the bookshelves of all wine lovers." and knew we just HAD to have this book. Vino Italiano is written by "Mario Eats Italy" Batali's partner (Mr. Bastianich) and a former senior editor of Wine & Spirits magazine (David Lynch). These guys are serious wine buffs. But it's all tempered by a bit of fun injected by Batali, who along with Lidia Bastianich (Joseph's mom) contributed the recipes at the end of each chapter. These folks truly understand Italian wine is, after all, meant to be consumed with food! There's more here than you may ever want to know, but the book is a success on many levels for many people, from the barely curious to the Italian wine lover. Although they try to write about all the wines from Italy, they suggest (and furnish information on importers) tastings of wines that are available in the US. We highly recommend this book as well as TCI's The Italian Wine Guide. Larry Theobald, CycleItalia www.cycleitalia.com</span>

                    <span>Vino Italiano is not the best book if what you need is an introduction to Italian wine. But if you already know there is a big difference between a Vino Rosso di Montepulciano and a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, then you'll no doubt appreciate this informative and easy-to-read book as much as I do.<P>This book gives the lover of Italian wine, food, and culture a lot to be excited about. It is divided into chapters that cover an Italian region (or in one case, two minor regions) and each chapter contains more information than some lesser books contain in their entirety. Included are regional recipes, maps and other essential information (e.g. significant producers, grapes grown, etc.) related to its wines, and stunning black-and-white photos that make it tempting to regard this as a coffee-table book. But I think the best part of each chapter is a well-written and entertaining essay that includes anecdotes that frame the character of the people, history, and culture of the region being described.<P>Of course, the centerpiece of it all is wine. But authors David Lynch and Joseph Bastianich understand that even in Italy, that subject cannot stand alone, and so they bring in discussions of hunting, and football, and fashion, and Mussolini, and cars, and artisan vinegars, oils, and cheeses.<P>Reading over what I have written here, I feel that I have not done this book justice. There is such a range of well-researched information here presented in such an accessible way that a different reader might pick it up and enjoy the book just as much as I do but for an entirely different set of reasons. <P>Perhaps the best way to conclude, then, is with my own brief anecdote: Italy is a country very understandably proud of its culture of food and wine, and the domestic Italian best-seller lists always have a few new books on those subjects listed on them. And yet every time - without fail - that I show this book to my Italian friends, their comment is, "Why can't we have a book like this in Italian?"</span>

                    <span>I am a lover and a drinker of wine, and not a collector or wine professional. I purchased this book because I was interested in learning more about navigating the world of Italian wine-- i.e. To further my enjoyment of Italian wine and allow me to make intelligent decisions when choosing from a wine list in a restaurant, shopping in the local wine shop, or pairing Italian wines with food at home. This book was exactly what I needed.<P>"Vino Italiano" is an not only an exceptional introduction to the world of Italian wine, it goes further than many (and many excellent) wine books I have read or consulted. This book places the wine in context- beginning each regional chapter with a short vignette which helps us gain a feeling for who might drink these wines, in what kind of setting, and with what kind of food. It goes well beyond the usual formula of explaining laws, grapes, producers, geography, history, and wine making methods, although it describes all of these thoroughly as well (though it is not deeply technical). It is not only a pleasure to read, it seems to me to be the beginning of a long and rewarding path into learning about the world not only of Italian wine, but Italian wine as a part of Italian culture- and especially representing regional culture when paired with regional foods (a couple well-chosen recipes at the end of each chapter). I was originally skeptical about the presentation, including each chapter's introductory vignette, and the recipes at the end of each chapter, but after reading, I have to admit that the construction of the chapters seems to provide a natuaral path to approach learning about each region, and in fact has helped me to remember more of the nuts-and-bolts information about each regional wine. (I would certainly welcome more wine books about other countries written in the same format.) In the end, there is a wealth of information that adds to the overall purpose I had in buying the book- to increase my understanding, knowledge, and ability to gain enjoyment from Italian wine. "Vino Italiano" is also very easy to access as a basic reference on the wines of Italy. It is not, however, a catalog, although there is plenty of material here for a beginner or probably even an intermediate to base his/her shopping on. "Vino Italiano" will provide you with a very pleasurable means to building a foundation upon which to understand, seek out, taste, and ultimately to enjoy the many varied and delicious wines of Italy. Highly recommended.</span>

Once you have read the book, you will also have recepies to serve with your wine, and where to eat while traveling through Italy. I cant wait for there next book.

                    <span>This is more than a guide to Italian wine--It is a guide to Italian history, culture, wineries, food and personality. I find myself constantly turning to it whenever I get another bottle of Italian wine. It is comprehensive in its information on vintages, producers, importers etc. The recipe sections for each are wonderful. This book has it all if you want to educate yourself in the overwhelming area of Italian wine, its history, and the amazing variety and tastes wine has to offer</span>
