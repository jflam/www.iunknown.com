This resource has been designed in consultation with the Aboriginal community, to provide teachers with information and teaching material on various Aboriginal issues applicable to Human Society and Its Environment programs. <I>Performing Arts </I>looks at Aboriginal performing arts in the context of pre-contact Aboriginal performing arts, the impact of invasion on Aboriginal cultural expression and the revitalisation and popularity of Aboriginal performing arts today. It covers information on Aboriginal music, dance and theatre and identifies exciting websites for students to explore these areas further.</span>

                    <span>This book does an excellent job of combining strategic thinking and planning with execution. Unlike many similar efforts that focus solely on tactics, Sponsorship Seeker's Toolkit talks through the essentials of strategy and objectives backed up with comprehensive tactical suggestions and templates. The authors clearly bring real life experience and expertise to the book, making it a must-read for sponsorship seekers from all industries.</span>

                    <span>This book is a godsend for people on both sides of the sponsorship fence. I have managed sponsorships for a number of major corporates. It used to break my heart to see needy and well meaning organisations waste valuable resources sending poorly targetted proposals. Sponsees with the good sense to use a guide like the sponsorship toolkit, will greatly enhance their chances of finding a suitable sponsorship partner. Good luck!</span>

                    <span>If you are seeking a sponsor, this is the book for you. In a step by step format, in great DETAIL, the authors take you through all aspects of sponsorship: how to prepare if you are seeking a sponsor, what you have to offer, how sponsors see the world and what they look for, creating a marketing plan and how to write a proposal. <P>This was the dream book I was looking for. It is an invaluable guide and, I think, the gold standard for those seeking sponsorship.</span>

                    <span>What most impresses me about this book is the relevant information provided right from the beginning. Within a matter of pages I found valuable tools to apply in my everyday activities, and that trend continued throughout. Now I keep the book at arms reach as a reference guide. If all sponsorship seekers were to embrace the principles outlined in the book, our efforts would become more successful, while instilling a higher level of professionalism in what we do.</span>

                    <span>I've read nearly a dozen books on the business of sponsorship, and this ranks near the top. It's full of useful information. The book helped me see some things in a new light. For beginning sponsor seekers, this book is worth it's weight in gold. I hope my competition doesn't get their hands on it.</span>
