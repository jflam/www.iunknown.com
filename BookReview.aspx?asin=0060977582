                <span id="Label1"><I>The Overspent American</I> explores why so many of us feel materially dissatisfied, why we work staggeringly long hours and yet walk around with ever-present mental "wish lists" of things to buy or get, and why Americans save less than virtually anyone in the world. Unlike many experts, Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor does not blame consumers&#39; lack of self-discipline. Nor does she blame advertisers. Instead she analyzes the crisis of the American consumer in a culture where spending has become the ultimate social art.</span>

                    <span>uliet Schor gives a description of the American consumer and it's passion for buying useless things. While informative, she tends to ignore problems of housing, education, and taxes and concentrates on single or couples and there problems.<P>This book is very good in that she does her research and she does it well. Unlike the book, "Affluenza", she doesn't resort to deriding people, but instead gives informed and statistically valid opinions. She tends to know who to place the blame on, the consumer's themselves.<P>She describes an accurate portrayal of "keeping up the Jones", and how that is now a skewed view in which results in a constant race against debt and time. She also goes into shopping therapy and the sub-conscious need for status and style. <P>All in all, it works for some people. This is great knowledge for empty-nesters or people living in cheaper parts of the country with no family. Most of the information is useless to families, as expensive clothes and new cars probably pale in comparison to housing costs. To me, that makes this book incomplete, and the title misleading, as her "solutions" don't even address the average American family.</span>

                    <span>I liked this book a lot, for the reasons stated in most of the favorable reviews - so I won't repeat their remarks.<P>I also thought the social democratic solutions were questionable, for the reasons stated in Jeffrey Sauro's review (plus, Schor hasn't confronted the failure of social democracy in Europe- skyrocketing unemployment in some countries, nosediving birth rates, etc.)<P>Another criticism: In some ways, Schor seems unaware of what's going on with people outside her own northeastern liberal urban little world. Specifically:<P>*She thinks private school enrollment is skyrocketing due to conspicious consumption (p. 86) - an understandable view of most of your friends live in cities where private schooling is common. But in fact, private school enrollment has stagnated in recent decades because most middle class people prefer to avoid both private school tuition and urban diversity by moving to suburban public schools. If Schor hung around with more suburbanites maybe she would know this.<P>*Gratuitious liberal corporate bashing. She asserts that virtually everything is environmentally unfriendly (p. 156), and how Nikes are made in sweatshops and how awful that is - a point which (1) is inconsistent with her message because if Nikes were made by unionized workers making $20 an hour they would cost even more and (2) is a distraction from her main message that a good editor would have cut, since it doesn't add anything and really ticks off readers to the right of Ralph Nader.<P>*She seems to think that status is unrelated to safety (p. 95). Probably true in Boston; for whatever reason, the crime rates in high-status and low-status suburbs are pretty similar, and the city's crime rate is lower than that of most other American cities. But in relatively high-crime metro areas like Miami, Atlanta and DC, picking the right neighborhood can be a life and death matter. Which illustrates another problem with Schor's book: because (like many leftists) she ignores crime except as evidence that our welfare state is too small, she doesn't realize that crime really is a major driver of consumption: to avoid crime, Americans in high crime metros are forced to (1) live a zillion miles out in suburbs, creating lots of auto-related expenses or (2) live in the small number of safe close in areas, which are expensive due to their rarity and intrinsic desirability. <P>*Schor writes: "The South has not been known for being a particularly status-oriented area." (p. 78). Schor's view of "the South" must have been formed by Mayberry RFD rather than by reality. If she knew more about, say, Atlanta, she would know that status is as important there as anyplace (especially since the urban South has high crime, and high crime means high housing and commuting costs).<P>This book is a good book - but had it been carefully edited by someone with a radically different background from Schor's (preferably a suburban Sunbelt conservative) it could have been a flawless book.</span>

                    <span>This book was pretty good, although I enjoyed Affluenza a little more. Many Americans come off online as spoiled babies who can never get enough, as is seen by reviews for this book. They get their opinions from Talk Radio and television, because they are incapable of thinking for themselves. They deny and placate away any guilt because they would rather be a soul-less consumer than a responsible human being. It is not liberal to care for the environment; it is smart. If you're smart, you surely would know better than to excrete in your own cave. Perhaps not.<BR>Yes, consumerism all comes down to personal responsibility. With great freedom comes great responsibility. In this country of "entitlement", few seem to want to bear the brunt of that responsibility.</span>

                    <span>Mrs. Schor brings up so many great points that hit so close to home, several times during my reading, I had to put the book down, and simply think for a moment about the sociological points on consumerism she brought up. Something she said, either applied to me, someone in my family, or a friend, or my neighborhood. <P>This book really caused me to think about reevaluating my priorities. It made me think about whether buying my "things" really gives me satisfaction, or temporarily satisfies a void in my life. <P>However, this is one of many books that deals with extreme consumption, and simple living as a way to combat it. As with all these books, whenever the issue of "simple living" is discussed, there will be mentions of caring for the environment, and living with less. Any mention of caring for the environment suggests liberalism, which may annoy some readers. If you bother to read this book, be prepared for that angle, though the entire book is NOT liberal.<P>If you want to handle a book that was good, even though it is HIGHLY LIBERAL, read "Your Money or Your Life", by Dominguez and Robin. This book is familiar to whomever is reading this review. I'm sure of it.</span>

                    <span>The statistical data presented in this book may now be outdated but it still is very insightful as it is. While there is personal accountability, many people may neither be quite aware nor they have realized the reasons why they are in debt very consciously. Some people lack financial goals or money management skills (even if they are considered high salary earners) fueled by lack of values and especially the seductions and 'pressures' to acquire more - that is to keep up, to give or please, to show, to belong, to be seen as. <P>This may not be the first book written about frugality, I believe that this is a good read. It could make a person more aware of what consumerism is for. I suspect the reason why some readers weren't so pleased with this book was because it is more of 'whats and whys' written in an academic context ( a thesis) with so many lists of bibliography, notes and works cited that maybe others found irrelevant. But we need to understand the whys and whats in order to do the now what and how to...practically. <P>In terms of downshifting that is earning less and working less or leaving a 9-to-5 job, it may not be possible for others to do. The truth is its not for everyone. A reviewer said that downshifters look suspicious to him or her, well, I could understand the point too since there are many dishonest people everywhere and there will always be. Nonetheless, there are people who have done it with honesty and dignity.<P>I am merely a student of frugality and I have readt few books about the subject. For people who are interested about the idea of downshifting, I would like to recommend the book below:<BR>"How to Survive Without a Salary: Learning how to live The Conserver Lifestyle" by Charles Long. Reviewers of this book seemed to be very pleased with the way it was written, including myself.</span>
