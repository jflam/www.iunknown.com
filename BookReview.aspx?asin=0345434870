                    <span>Ever since I saw Katherine Hepburn play Eleanor of Aquitaine in the film Lion in Winter, I have read everything available on this fascinating 12th century woman - and this book was, by far, the most readable, and probably the most accurate. Though Allison Weir avoids over romanticizing the story by passing along legends as facts (that Eleanor murdered her husband's mistress or the many tales surrounding her Court of Love), she still weaves a fascinating tale. Because Weir is such a stickler for researched facts, there are long sections where she admits that very little is known about what exactly Eleanor was doing at the time (most notably during the murder of Thomas Becket), but I still never lost interest - and she provides enough balanced background on the many characters that you develop a true understanding for their complicated motives. After reading Weir's other books (especially the definitive "Six Wives of Henry VIII"), I was positive that this would be another enjoyable history lesson - and Ms. Weir, as usual, did not disappoint!</span>

                    <span>She was the wife of two kings (Louis VII of France and Henry II of England) and a fascinating and controversial woman in her own right. Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, was one of the most important and influential personalities of the Middle Ages and she truly comes alive in Alison Weir's masterful biography. After a short introduction on the history and culture of Southern France, Ms. Weir describes Eleanor's life in wonderful detail, examining contemporary sources, modern historical investigations, myth and reality. Everything you ever heard about Eleanor is here: her marriage to King Louis, her journey to Constantinople and Jerusalem during the Second Crusade, her marriage to King Henry, her emotional and political relations with her sons (two of them were also kings of England: Richard the Lionheart and King John), her role as Queen Regent, the legendary Courts of Love, and her imprisonment and eventual release are all told in Alison Weir's wonderful style. The author also includes a lot of information about other fascinating personalities of the time, such as Bernard of Clairvaux, Thomas Becket and William the Marshall, and she always manages to evoke the feeling of the period. This is a very well researched and brilliantly written biography that reads like a historical novel.</span>

                    <span>In my humble opinion, Alison Weir is the best writer of accessible English history. She manages to write in a simple, accessible style without compromising detail or historical accuracy. Her books are fun to read, but so packed full of information.<P>Taking a break from her usual subject of Tudor and Medieval English history, this book examines the life of Eleanor of Aquataine. It is easy to succumb to hyperbole when writing reviews, but it is NO exageration to say that Eleanor is one of the most interesting people to have ever graced this planet. Hieress of what is now southern France, she left her husband, the French king, for the English king and took her tremendous land holdings with her, thus prompting the 100 years war and causing the great English/French rivalry that has existed ever since. She botched the 2nd crusade by tagging along with her friends as "Amazons." She brought "the art of courtly love" to Paris and London, thus encouraging the creation of chivalry and the Aurthurian legend, and sponsored some of the most important advances in the arts during the early Middle Ages. She fathered 2 kings, acted as regent for one while he was on a Crusade, and was imprisoned by her husband for a decade because she helped her sons plan a coup d'etat. Are you starting to believe that I'm not exagerating?<P>Weir brings all of her skills as a historian and writer to this book, and it is a fascinating read. If I have one complaint, it is that simply not enough detail exists about Eleanor's life. It's pretty hard to miss the major events, but when writing about a subject who lived 800 years ago it is simply a fact that very few letters, diaries, or personal accounts exist. These are the things that let us glimpse into the minds of great people, and it is sometimes maddening that there is no way to understand WHY things happened the way they did. <P>Despite this, Weir manages to use the little she has to go on to great effect, and this is the best biography of Eleanor out there (though the Marion Meade one is also pretty good).</span>

                    <span>Well, I think I read enough praises of this book from reading all the past reviews written prior to this one. I supposed another one probably won't hurt. And I am sure that some other person will come along after me to say the same thing.<P>So having got that off my chest, I would say without a doubt that this book is probably the most readable biography on Eleanor of Aquitaine you will probably ever read. Its not only the most readable but its probably one of the best (although I enjoyed Amy Kelly's book just as much). The book was well written and with honesty, without much bias although it was pretty clear that Weir admired her subject. I liked that Weir tries to cut through many of the mediveal bias against Eleanor, especially on the Rosamund la Clifford affair. Only real complaint I would have is that its need more maps - for the casual readers whose knowledge of mediveal European geography may be lacking.<P>But no one can go wrong reading this book and enjoying it at the same time.</span>

                    <span>Weir's breadth of scholarship is astounding but for the reader interested in details about Eleanor of Aquitaine, Weir makes it quite clear that s/he is sure to be sorely disappointed. Although ostensibly a biography of Eleanor there is little about her in the book due to a decided absence of information regarding her life in contemporary sources. I was disappointed in this lack of detail but, not knowing much about 12th-13th century England and France, found myself reading on just to learn about the era. Weir writes with a real objectivity that I appreciated. I recommend this book to the reader interested in the general history of the Plantagenets and the period in which they lived.</span>
