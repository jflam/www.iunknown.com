                    <span>Through flawed reasoning, Jim Wallis concludes that personal wealth is immoral, unjust, and wrong.  He insists that the path to freedom consists of limiting the resources of very wealthy people.  <p>If you follow Jim  Wallis's line of thinking, no one deserves vast personal wealth.   Therefore, people who have achieved it must have their wealth limited by  society -- in other words, give it back.  After all, society made it  possible for the rich to accumulate their wealth in the first place,  right?<p>Wrong answer.  Wealth is a product of personal financial  responsibility and determined work.  We live in the greatest country in the  world, simply because it is possible in America for people to overcome  poverty and ascend to personal financial freedom in a single generation.   In other words, we have the ability, through our own talents and ingenuity,  to create wealth.  To make money, if you will.<p>What would be the  incentive to do so, if once we achieve personal financial freedom, we are  compelled to support others who are unable or unwilling to do what we have  done.  Charity should be a personal choice, not a social demand.  Certainly  not a legislated requirement.  If income is capped, there will be no  incentive to achieve.  People will not continue to perform if the result of  their accomplishment is social outrage, programmed guilt, and deliberate  taxation to restore them to some median level of income.<p>And if those who  are currently the investors, the entrepreneurs, the small business owners,  and the corporate visionaries are disincentivized for performing, chances  are good they will CEASE TO PERFORM.  In other words, if you place a limit,  a legal limit, for whatever moral reason you think matters, on the amount  of money people are allowed to earn, they will stop trying to earn more  than that amount.  <p>An entrepreneur or a high-powered executive invests  all he or she can into reaching their goals.  At stake may be their money,  their time, their reputation, their commitment, possibly their  relationships.  They would not be willing to take those risks without the  chance for the reward.<p>The bad news is that if their willingness to take  risks and outperform other people dies, then the "magic" fortune  that they could accumulate, the one Jim Wallis wants to tap to fund his  social spending programs, will vanish.  It will cease to exist.  It is an  economic fact.  <p>Entrepreneurs, visionary executives, and high earners  will no longer be there to run big businesses, to make big investments, to  build big successes.  And without them, the companies will not succeed.  No  one will be employed.<p>These are the economic realities that Jim Wallis  has overlooked.  As good as his vision sounds, unless he can personally  fund these ideas, he can not advocate them.  To do so is the equivalent of  giving the pay check of every American to the federal government, and  allowing the government to redistribute it according to need.  <p>Sound  good?  Communism failed.<p>I would personally like to thank each of my  employers for creating their businesses and offering me a chance to work  with them.  I hope that my contributions helped to make you successful.   The wages you paid me were fair, and I earned them honestly.  The value I  got was equivalent to the value I gave.<p>How great our country would be if  more people were willing to give credit where credit is due: to the  successful business men and women who employ us.</span>

                    <span>Wallis may be the most balanced voice in our culture today.  In The Soul of Politics, he first tears away at silly conservative notions of "me first" and "us against them".  He especially dresses down  the radical religious right for misappropriating the sacred name of Jesus  for the sake of obtaining raw political power.  But just as you begin to  think Wallis is a left-wing liberal, he rips into "feelgood"  liberal approaches to society that have been proven failures.  Instead,  Wallis suggests a new polemic, really rooted in the prophets of old, that  teaches both personal, moral responsibility and genuine, Christian  compassion.  He rejects false choices of left versus right and invites all  people of faith, especially Christians, to create a new politics of  community, compassion and civility.  Wallis is a noted Evangelical.  He's  currently a fellow at Harvard but also heads the Christ-centered  "Sojourners" magazine and urban ministry in the nation's capitol.   Please...read The Soul of Politics.  You will be challenged and  encouraged!</span>
