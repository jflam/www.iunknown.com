                    <span>Bound for Oregon by Jean Van Leeuwen, was a book about a 9-year old girl about her journey through the Oregon Trail.  It starts out in Arkansas(which was a little odd because most people traveled around Arkansas because all they saw at first was swamps)at their home.  She talks about how they moved to Arkansas because of all the illness that was going around.  After a while, I lost interest in this book because it was so boring.  It stopped having any adventure and got very monotonous.<br>The setting was in Arkansas sat first and then all the way along the Oregon Trail.  I recommend this book to no one.</span>

                    <span>This book was alittle more interesting because of the fact that they were leaving Arkansas.(this is were I live) As they leave many people turn back, because they are scared. With the four remaining they go on. With conflict the four splint into 2 groups. A story element for this book would be conflict because of the difference of opinion. GOOD BOOK!</span>

                    <span>This book was about a girl who has to go to oregon with her family. She has to go through deaths and hardships along the way.I like the fact that her father was so understanding and nice plus it didn't hurt that they were from Arkansas. My favorite part was seeing the romance between the kids. It was good that they were going through such a hard time and could still party at night.I liked it when she flashed back to when her dad was making pottery instead of being sick.all in all, it's a good book.</span>

                    <span>The book was pretty good but it lacked thrill and excitement.  After a while the book got really monotnous and I lost intrest quickly, although I read the whole book in 1 day.  But it was a great story in a remarkable era in history.</span>
