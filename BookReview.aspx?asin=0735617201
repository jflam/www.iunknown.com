                    <span>In general I would say this book has something to offer to the introductory XML Web service author. It covers a broad number of beginning topics and even lightly touches on some intermediate level areas.
<br />
<br />Where the book falls short, in my opinion, is in the area of how the sample exercies are constructed. The sample Web service projects are stored in a variety of different virtual directories, yet they utilize the same services names, so isolating them in the Web Reference dialog box requires a little know how that I think could confuse the beginner. Additionally the client projects reutilize a number of form controls and layouts and could have significantly benefited from one form type that was modified over the course of the client projects. Lastly, in terms of the exercises, the book did not always make clear the changes required in client side code, indicating that changes were highlighted when in fact other changes were evident and required as well.
<br />
<br />From an 10,000 foot view I think the exercises could have more directly mapped to an object-oriented design philosphy, wherein the additional functionality was encapsulated in classes a little more cleanly and done as incremental changes to the exercises.</span>

                    <span>This book and Programming Visual Basic .NET by Francesco Balena have answered virtually all of my questions about building production distributed database applications using XML Web services.

                    <span>I found this book very good for an intro to web services<br>This books also gives good tips to debuggin in web services which I have not found in any book. All the examples work <br>except for the example which demonstrates integrated security,<br>which is a real shame.<br>This book took me 3 days to go through. I am very pleased with <br>the content.<br>As with most books this book lacks a real world implementation <br>at the end.</span>

                    <span>If you have a knowledge of VB or C#, this book does a pretty good job teaching you how to create your own Web service and use other out there on the Internet, even if you don't have prior experiences. <p>This book assumes you have VS.NET. If you don't have it, it won't be helpful. VS.NET makes using and especially creating Web Services easy and this book tells you how easily you can do it.<p>Here are why I think the book is good. <p>* Presentation is clear. You'll know what you'll be learning in each chapter. <p>* Sample code is provided on the web.<p>* No talking down.<p>* The authors really mean "step-by-step". Little rooms for mistakes.<p>Bad things.<p>* Because the book explains the basics, you may be able to find all the information on the Web. You'll probably need more time searching and filtering them, though.</span>
