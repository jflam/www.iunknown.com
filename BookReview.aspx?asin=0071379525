                    <span>This is an excellent text for indviduals new to project management as well as experienced project managers. While short on advanced project management tools and techniques, the book does provide solid advice and best-practice guidance for achieving project success...well done! One recommendation would be to package a CD with document templates.</span>

                    <span>This is a basic PM book with little insight towards growth of your PM skills.  Too much is not covered like SOWs, Activity Charts and such and very little is really touched in depth. Another downside is the Brad story is so simplistic as to be boring.  Pass by.</span>

                    <span>I too have read a lot of project management books, and found this one to be one of the best. It is written clearly and simply and is helpful to both new and experienced project managers. It is a good book overall. I might recommend a certain chapter from book X and a different chapter from book Y to someone, but I would recommend this whole book.</span>

                    <span>This book is a down-to-earth, hands-on guide for new project managers as well as for those who are experienced, but still struggling with attaining successful implementaiton of projects in their organization.  It provides a very "grounded" approach--the author's extensive "real life" experience was obvious.  The book focuses largely on the technical aspects of projects, but also very nicely brings to light the key human elements (effective team leadership, stakeholder management and communication) that are critical for project success.  I also liked how it mixed the strategic and tactical elements of project management into a kind of "best practices" guide to project managers.  The layout and storyline are designed to be a quick, easy reference and a fun read.  <p>From the perspective of both consulting and project management within my own firm, but also in my experience of working with clients who struggle with understanding and implementing successful projects, this is an excellent resource for them</span>
