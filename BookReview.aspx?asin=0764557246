                    <span>I just had my eyes opened to all that Visio can do by reviewing the book Visio 2003 Bible by Bonnie Biafore (Wiley).  
<br />
<br />Chapter list:  Getting Started with Visio; Getting Started with Drawings; Working with Visio Files; Working with Shapes; Connecting Shapes; Working with Text; Formatting Visio Elements; Inserting, Linking, and Embedding Objects; Importing, Exporting, and Publishing Visio Data to the Web; Linking Shapes with Data; Collaborating with Others; Building Block Diagrams; Constructing Charts and Graphs; Working with Organization Charts; Working with Flowcharts; Documenting Business Processes; Scheduling Projects with Visio; Documenting Brainstorming Sessions; Modeling and Documenting Databases; Building UML Models; Building Software Development Diagrams; Mapping Web Sites; Creating Network Diagrams; Working with Scaled Drawings; Creating Scaled Plan Drawings; Laying Out Architectural and Engineering Plans; Integrating CAD and Visio; Working with Engineering Drawings; Creating and Customizing Templates; Creating and Customizing Stencils; Creating and Customizing Shapes; Customizing Shapes Using ShapeSheets; Formatting with Styles; Customizing Toolbars and Menus; Automating Visio; Installing Visio 2003; Visio 2003 Help Resources; Additional Resources for Templates and Stencils; Keyboard Shortcuts; Template and Stencil Reference; Index
<br />
<br />As you can tell, there's not much left to cover after Bonnie gets done.  :-)
<br />
<br />As an IT professional, I've used Visio for the basics.  Someone wants a flowchart, I can fake my way through a decent looking diagram.  And that was pretty much all I thought Visio could do...  basic drawings.  But going through this book was an eye-opener.  I didn't know that you could output Visio output for the web.  I didn't know you could hook shapes up to data sources.  And I *really* didn't know that Visio could produce a site map of a web site!  Guess what I'll be trying at work tomorrow...
<br />
<br />The author does a great job of covering the material at a level that everyone can understand.  Due to the comprehensive nature of the book, I think that all levels of users can get something from the book, too.  Those who are new to Visio will get a good foundation in the basics.  Those (like me) who haven't explored past the basics will discover all sorts of new toys.  And experts may find a feature or two that they didn't know about.
<br />
<br />Definitely a keeper that will end up on my bookshelf at work, and one that I'll have to guard against greedy fingers...
