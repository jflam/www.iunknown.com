                    <span>Laura Berman Fortgang really gets it...and knows how to give it back. Having read all of her books, I love that Now What? guides us through the process of discovering how our own truths yield meaningful, productive results -- for ourselves and our clients. She reminds us, "It's not what you do, but who you are when you are doing it." To learn from Laura's years of experience as a Master Coach, industry pioneer, author, and mentor is the best gift I have ever given myself. Everyone will discover something valuable for themselves at the end of their 90 days. Thanks, Laura.</span>

                    <span>Living by an inner compass is easier said than done. Laura Berman Fortgang provides sound advice, homework, and a mixture of intellect and intuition in outlining how 90 days of focused intent towards a life direction can unfold. What impressed me most about this book was that Fortgang shared her own story of risk when changing her career from actress to life coach. If you want to read about someone who has done the groundwork she prescribes, this book is a great choice. The content is broken down in week-by-week and offers feedback so the reader can self-manage a transitional program on their own. Fortgang also provides a variety of resources the financial nuts and bolts of a career switch. The tone is very down-to-earth, humorous, and engaging. A fluid and insightful read for people who feel like a caterpillar in their careers and are ready to commit to a 90-day cocoon period. Caution: if you want to emerge a career butterfly with this program, you must have a self-discipline to do with full force and enthusiasm what Fortgang suggest. Her book is not a passive self-actualization process ... but a "get off your ass and go for it with measurable results" career planning workout.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the best and most enjoyable books I've read. It's straight forward, will get you thinking about what you love, and REALLY gives PLENTY of practical guidance on how to get there. It's a must-read for anyone serious about getting passion back into their lives.</span>

                    <span>What a great way to look at life!  Laura's approach in this book invites the reader to really consider what's next in life and to explore and take action to get there.  "Now What" is an enjoyable and rewarding adventure of introspection, discovery and action no matter where you are at in your journey.
