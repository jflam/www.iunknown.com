                <span id="Label1">In the tradition of <i>Black Hawk Down</i> and <i>Jarhead</i> comes a searing portrait of young men fighting a modern-day war. <br><br> A powerhouse work of nonfiction, <i>Generation Kill</i> expands on Evan Wright's acclaimed three-part series that appeared in <i>Rolling Stone</i> during the summer of 2003. His narrative follows the twenty-three marines of First Recon who spearheaded the blitzkrieg on Iraq. This elite unit, nicknamed "First Suicide Battalion," searched out enemy fighters by racing ahead of American battle forces and literally driving into suspected ambush points. <br><br> Evan Wright lived on the front lines with this platoon from the opening hours of combat, to the fall of Baghdad, through the start of the guerrilla war. He was welcomed into their ranks, and from this bird's-eye perspective he tells the unsettling story of young men trained by their country to be ruthless killers. He chronicles the triumphs and horrors-physical, moral, emotional, and spiritual-that these marines endured while achieving victory in a war many questioned before it began. Wright's book is a timely account of war; even more important, it is a timeless description of the human drama taking place on today's battlefields. Written with brutal honesty, raw intensity, and startling intimacy, Generation Kill is destined to become a classic and take its place in the canon of the most captivating and authentic works of war literature.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Following in the footsteps of Black Hawk Down, Generation Kill is a brutally honest account of elite American soldiers in modern war. Evan Wright even surpasses Mark Bowden's work in that he had the opportunity to ride alongside the troops while the events described in this book were taking place. He relates most of the events in Generation Kill from a very personal first hand perspective, whereas Bowden had to research the battle of Mogadishu after the fact. One cannot help but admire Wright's commitment to this project. He rode right in front, at the focal point of firefights and ambushes, and never lost his courage to see it through to the end. In doing so, I believe he won many of the Marines' respect, which is probably a large reason why they opened up to him so much (altho I'm sure a few of them didn't mind being in the spotlight of Wright's story, either). <P>The unit involved in Generation Kill is the USMC's 1st Recon Battalion. Recon is a special commando type unit within the Marine Corps, surpassed in the pecking order only by its elite wing, known as Force Recon. Recon Marines share the same level of specialization and capability as many of the more generally well known American special ops units. By doctrine of training and mission parameters, they are somewhat of a cross between Army Rangers and Navy SEALs. 1st Recon Battalion was often spearheading the assault and dangling itself in front of the enemy to draw out ambushes during the OIF invasion. They operated very aggressively and willingly put themselves in some of the most dangerous situations faced by any unit during the war. <P>Generation Kill will undoubtedly prove to be one of the essential accounts of the OIF invasion, and a classic account of American war. What makes Wright's book so engrossing is the fact that it is brutally honest in its depiction of all aspects of 1st Recon's experience. He admires the Marines, but he does not glorify them. Some are idealistic men who believe in their mission. Some are stone cold killers (As one Marine chaplain puts it, the men in Recon "use Jesus as a door mat"). One particular marine sees himself as a "tool of the white man". In one instance they are struggling to give emergency medical aid to injured civilians. In another instance someone recites gangsta rap lyrics as he ecstatically sprays machine gun fire on the enemy. Although Wright praises 1st Recon's victories, he pulls no punches in relating some very serious mistakes and internal failings within the unit as well. There are several instances where innocent civilians are mistakenly killed in the fog of war. Some of the Marines seem to lose all confidence in their leadership. Many of the officers in 1st Recon are fine leaders who enjoy the trust and affection of their men. On the other hand, one company commander is a trigger happy glory hunter who would have his men search for random fights and conduct unauthorized raids rather than regroup with the battalion, as they were ordered. Then there's an officer in another company who turns out to be a sadistic imbecile, and his incompetence and instability in the field earns him the contempt of his men.<P>All in all, Evan Wright's perspective is detailed and truthful without being judgmental. He succeeds in creating an honest depiction and well rounded depiction of one unit's experience. Wright does not fabricate heroes, nor does he vilify the military. Generation Kill is an insightful account of modern war, and a valuable study of the internal dynamics of an American combat unit.</span>

                    <span>I'm glad to read a story about the Marines that is uncensored - with the high expectations of the American people set by the greatest generation that ever lived I found it impossible to live up to Steven Spielberg's version of "Band of Brothers". Being a Marine in 1st Recon Bn, Evan Wright's interpretation of our daily lives and experiences are extremely accurate. While reading the book almost a year later I had forgotten some of the details of my own experiences that Wright brought back to life. It was almost like I was living through the war again. Simply put, if you want to know what it is like to be a Marine during this campaign there is no better book at this time. It seems to me that Evan Wright was influenced by nothing but the experiences and the personalities that he absorbed during the war. No one is over exaggerated.</span>

                    <span>I am a 12-year veteran of the Marine Corps and was in Beirut with two different infantry Battalions. I am not a fan of the Iraq war and I despise George Bush. However I am still very connected to the Marine Corps and follow their activities. This book is a must have for anyone interested in the Marine Corps or the Iraq war. Its an excellent first hand account of raw combat. For the big picture buy "The March Up".</span>

                    <span>I was a Recon Marine (Bravo Co. 3rd. Plt.) in the first Gulf War and Somalia. I look at this book from the distance of time, for my own experience, and with a history degree to reflect upon. The Marines have not changed much, nor has the command structure. There were good officers and enlisted men, and bad ones. The bad ones being deadly by the nature of the work. Yet, when you go to war you are stuck with what you have. First and foremost Wright illustrates that maxim of war.<P>Secondly, Wright, if he follows up on the consequences, shows the dillema of a journalist being too close to the war. He is embedded with his subjects and the story himself. For me, he did an outstanding job of staying objective about the chaos and slaughter of war. As well, he shows the American Fighting Man for all the things that he is. Some do not want to hear it but many Marines do look forward to war and that does not change after the first round goes off. But Wright does, in a way, become one of the boys. However, he could not have gotten this story if he had not, Recon Marines tend to not like reporters because they usually get portrayed as ninja like Rambos, which is unreal.<P>Of course, Wright made a few errors on military details, which an editor should have caught. Reporters of military actions should know more about the military: the structure, rank, equipment and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. There are at least a few remarks in the book for which some Marines may unfortunately regret. I don't think journalists should edit themselves but greater care is given to other confidential sources.<P>Wright got his boots dirty and saw a piece of the military that America has chosen not to look at. This book is true to the American Marine who has to go to war with less than perfect conditions and make decisions that few other humans have to consider. <P>Semper Fi! (The God Father always had a rhaspy voice.)</span>

                    <span>This is certainly the best account of either Iraq war I've read. Those who've previously served will be gratified to find that, even today, the Marine Corps remains the elite service branch. Marines are still warriors. Marines still prize competence. And marines still train at every opportunity. <P>Evan Wright, a Rolling Stone reporter, embedded with a Marine Recon battalion operating at the spearhead of the Marine Corps advance to Baghdad and beyond, gets thoroughly assimilated into the platoon he's living among. He hero-worships the squad leaders, non-coms, the cold-eyed snipers, and the martial artist warriors. Some readers may think he is quite a bit taken in by the self images, the urban legends and the daily folklore of a macho world he finds impressive and intimidating, and with which he clearly yearns to identify, but he does convincingly portray a bunch of disparate young men from diverse backgrounds, some from the barrio and the jailhouse, some from affluent suburbs, who pretty much all do subscribe to the myth of the Marine Corps served up in the famous TV recruiting ad in which a knight in shining armor fights and slays a dragon, then morphs into a US Marine in dress blues saluting with the USMC mameluke sword. A surprising percentage of that Recon platoon enlisted because they saw that very ad (!). <P>The young marines talk the tough Marine Corps talk: "Question: What do you first feel when you accidentally shoot a civilian? Answer: Your rifle's recoil." But they nearly all do their best, and they are willing time and again to risk their own lives, to avoid inflicting civilian casualties. They manifestly feel a lot more than recoil when the accidents and mistakes inevitable in warfare occur. One of the main gripes of the rankers is US command's failure to make provision for adequate facilities and care for Iraqi prisoners of war and civilian casualties. Wright shows us US military forces behaving completely unlike the stereotypes found in the daily press. <P>Wright seemed sometimes more than a bit naive, but he does share, and can vividly describe, soldier's lives, discomforts, and the hazards of combat. He does a good job of explaining just how miserable it is to try to function in desert heat in one of the contemporary anti-gas outfits. Wright naturally recounts plenty of incidents illustrating war's horrors and brutality, but he can also explain some of its fascination, the way being shot at makes young men feel more alive, the way it makes the food taste better.<P>The author though does fail to recognize that enlisted men gossip incessantly, and that scuttlebutt about the incompetence, criminality, and dementia of individual officers and the reckless folly of all command decisions is ubiquitous in every service, and those kinds of stories and gripes need to be taken with a considerable grain of salt.</span>
