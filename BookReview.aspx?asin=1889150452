                    <span>Alan Schlein is the guru of search and find online . An award winning journalist he knows how to navigate through cyberspace. He includes lots of pointers from industry experts and divides the chapters into easy to find sections ranging from a) search strategy to search tools to b) saving and downloading your results to scouring government documents and public records-- great for ancestry searches and wills and other legal documents to getting the latest in news resourcesonline. A fabulous addition for any business book shelf and it belongs on every researcher's desk. Plus his section on Privacy Protection and your identity is probably worth the price of the book alone. I know and have the honor of having met the author-- he's a sharp guy who continues to update this reference tool and really knows his stuff. </span>

<br />This is the second of three basic guides by Facts on Demand press that I am very happy to have in my collection and to recommend to others.  
<br />
<br />Some really top-notch information brokers contributed to this book, and it is a superb reference, well-organized, that lacks a CD-ROM with clickable links or an Online Version to which access can be gained for a fee or from a password in the printed version.
<br />
<br />This book is extremely well-developed to the point that it can meet the needs of a first-time researcher eager to become quickly familiar with the ins and outs of the Internet, as well as the more experienced professional that wants a handy reference work to suggest new sources and methods.
<br />
<br />The other two books are Helen Burwell's "Online Competitive Intelligence"--the one book to buy if you can only buy one of these three books--and Sankey & Weber's "Public Records Online" (buy only if you have do work in this area or want to protect yourself by monitoring your divorced spouse's assets, etc.)</span>

                    <span>It used to be that a good reference librarian had only to keep up with the new books being published, and perhaps keep one eye on the newspapers and learned journals. Nowadays, one has to keep track of where best to find the answers to questions on the Web, as well. And it ain't easy! Massive printed volumes of Web addresses weren't much help even a decade ago because they were indiscriminate and seldom included annotations. What we needed -- and still need -- are a few collections of a (relatively) few carefully selected germane Web sites with the reasons given for their inclusion. And this discriminating and well thought out guide is the best one I've seen yet. It's intended mostly for the professional information broker or commercial researcher-for-hire, but librarians in any large public or academic library system do much the same sort of thing and will profit enormously by reading it. After an excellent introduction to the principles of online research, it's divided into topical sections: government resources, public records, news sites, business tools, and international (i.e., non-U.S.) research. Then there are several sections on managing and filtering what you find, how to evaluate its credibility and utility, and privacy concerns. Schlein spends considerable time on fee-based and "hidden" resources, too, not just the freebies on the public Web. Some of the sites he recommends I was already aware of, but there are many others I hadn't run across before. And I have been recommending his advice on search strategies and information massaging to my colleagues. There are a couple of annoying things about this otherwise superior book, however. One is the need for much, much tighter copyediting -- like saying "the software can be moderated" when they meant "modified," and the sometimes eccentric punctuation, and the tendency to break Web addresses in peculiar places (letting only the last character of ".html" fall to the next line gives you a quite different address). The other annoyance is a tendency by the author to laud (frequently) any book published by his editors, associates, or advisors -- so much so that it becomes embarrassing. But given the high quality of the book's actual content, I suppose I can live with that.</span>

                    <span>If your first concern with this sort of guide is learning to use the Internet to find quality information, or gain competitive or market intelligence using free resources on the Net, then 'Find It Online' is an excellent guide worth owning. <p>The analysis of what types of information you should and should not expect to find on the Internet is truly insightful, as are the suggestions on verifying the accuracy and authority of the information you uncover while searching. <p>The list of resources offered at the end of each section seems to provide thorough coverage of the topic, without overwhelming you with too many URL's to evaluate.<p>Finally, the section on online privacy and protection will open a casual user's eyes to the threats that online activities may entail.</span>

                    <span>While this book has got good intentions, it somehow fails to live up to the reviews that I have read of it.  There are literally thousands of websites listed in the book, with a brief statement of what the website is about.<p>As a Canadian, I found this book lacking.  If you are looking for American websites or information on American businesses or people, then this book will suit your needs.<p>The book's format does not lend itself to easy reading.  It is basically just listings of sites by category.  The pages are packed full and hard to read. The author has been extremely thorough in his listing of websites, but I just didn't find that it helped me out.</span>
