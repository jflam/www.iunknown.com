                    <span>Several typos and the reference to Karl Barth aside, this appears from many accounts to be THE biography of Luther.  It states all the important particulars without deviating to the extreme positions many others do.  Doesn't give you the full picture of the man that a thorough reading of his works does. Luther's complete sermons tell more about him and his relation to the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br />
<br />A bit flimsy paperback, this (cover separation within the first 100 pages read), with the grayish paper, but what else at such a price.

                    <span>I have tried to read about Luther from various authors and they seem to come up short.  Their is something very enriching about this particular bio.  The author does not superimpose his own viewpoint onto the revolutionary church reformer.  Here I Stand is a classic piece of literature and is easy for the non-theologian, even the unchurched person to read.</span>

                    <span>I am reviewing the 1950, Mentor Books Fifteenth Printing.<br>This book is well laid out. Much of the material is in lecture form. There are twenty-two content headings, 12 page Bibliography, References, Source of Illustrations, and comprehensive Index. The illustrations are just that monochrome sketches.<p>Roland H. Bainton received an A.B. degree from Whitman College, and B.D. and Ph.D. degrees form Yale University and form Oberlin College, Dr. Theological Seminary and from Oberlin College. He is a Specialist in Reformation history.<p>There are many biography and reference books on Martin Luther, each with its own strength s and weaknesses. This one by Roland H. Bainton is pretty comprehensive and goes into more depth than most. Do not get out your highlighter or you will highlight every page.<p>This is the story of a religious leader who is well known for leading the Protestant Reformation. "I cannot...I will not...Recant! Here I Stand."</span>

                    <span>"Here I Stand" is a fine biography of the 16th Century Reformer Martin Luther. It encapsulates the full range of his emotions and struggles as he led the Reformation, and it also summarizes his key teachings. Bainton has a nice way of showing the progression of Martin Luther's thought, as in the earlier chapters the reader witnesses the struggle Luther underwent to free himself of the medieval Roman Catholic church's accretions to the Word of God and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We see Luther's profound awakening to the Gospel, as he began to see in Christ the merciful and righteous God who grants salvation freely through faith. Then eventually we see the mature Luther, who has been freed of the false teachings and traditions of the medieval church. Bainton shows us Luther's boldness and courage as a reformer, and also his deep humility and his failings. This book shows us a picture of a man who was used by God to restore the church to the Word of God alone, to faith alone in Christ alone by grace alone.<p>The places where Bainton is weakest in this book is in his descriptions of how Luther understood the sacraments (baptism and communion) and how he understood the two realms of church and government. He doesn't quite explain these correctly in the Lutheran sense. But otherwise he has a helpful balance of the factors that influenced Luther and the reformation: social, political, historical, and most importantly theological factors. And the story is supplemented with personal stories showing his love for his wife and family, and his desire for a peaceful reform of the church. Above all Luther acted on the sure confidence in the Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.</span>

                    <span>This is a philosophical biography of Martin Luther.  Although it provides some details about Luther's personal life, early upbringing and later family life, the focus of the book is on Luther's struggle to reform the Catholic church.  The book is dense with summaries of Luther's writings, and it appears in a relatively small font, so it is not a quick or light read.  It assumes a familiarity with Christian ideals and scripture; nevertheless, you don't need to be a Bible scholar to appreciate its discussion.  <p>This book is filled with passages that made me stop, think and reflect, and then dog-ear the page for return visits.  Bainton quotes Luther: "Faith is a living, restless thing.  It cannot be inoperative.  We are not saved by works; but if there be no works, there must be something amiss with faith."  Later, "Music is to be praised as second only to the Word of God because by her all the emotions swayed...The Holy Spirit himself pays tribute to music when he records that the evil spirit of Saul was exorcised as David played upon his harp....This precious gift has been bestowed on men alone to remind them that they are created to praise and magnify the Lord."  Through reading this book, I became much more aware of the tremendous influence that Luther had on shaping numerous aspects of modern Western society.  Anyone with any interest in any form of Christianity should become acquainted with the ideas of Martin Luther, and reading this book would be a good start.</span>
