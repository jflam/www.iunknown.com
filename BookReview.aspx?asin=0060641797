                <span id="Label1"><p align="left">A leading spiritual writer recovers "The Desert Way of Believing" -- the spiritual pathway discovered by early Christian monks who lived in the Egyptian desert that is still relevant to Christians today. Alan Jones distills the elements that made this fully orthodox way of inner transformation a unique and important part of the early church. Refreshingly readable and filled with rich insights, <i>Soul Making</i> draws together the spirituality of modern literature and elements of psychology. Jones shows how the desert way can become for any spiritual seeker a soul-stretching means of experiencing the "wonder, mystery, and awe" at the heart of the Christian faith.</p></span>

                    <span>I live in the desert and have for years. It is not a place of "emptiness and death", it is not a good place for crying and there is nothing particularly Christain about it. If you come to the desert with preconceived notions, if you attempt to overlay the desert with your with your existing mental framework, if you know how the world works before you get here you're going to miss everything. The desert is an exciting and dynamic place but it's not an Eastern Forest, your perception must change. If you could see the desert after rain, if you could feel the promise of night at sunset in the summer you would be thrilled not saddened. If you could watch the Cactus Wrens play you would know. The desert night is a wonderful place, even in the summer, when you step into a dry desert wash you can feel the coolness. Step into the arroyo.</span>

                    <span>My minister spoke with me last September of the "gift of tears" mentioned in one of the chapters of this book. These tears "soften the heart and open the soul". At the time I was beginning treatment for clinical depression and was spending quite a bit of time excercising this "gift" and was sure that these tears were signs of my lack of faith in God. He helped me to see that the ability to cry for the world is fundamental to the Christian soul. Nine months later, I discovered this book from which that term derived.<P>Jones has written a challenging and spiritually inspiring guide to our progress through such questions as "Who is God? Who am I? What is the meaning of my life?" The resonance of his prose, the depth of his understanding, the richness of his literary references is phenomenol. If you are on a journey, seeking to discover the "soul" within you, you will find this book quite enlightening.<P>I cannot reccommend this book highly enough! It is not easy reading, but the answers to life and faith are not easy ones. This is a book to be savored, pondered, and returned to again and again as we continue in the life long process of "soul making".</span>

                    <span>Very few books in 20th century Christian sprituality can match the depth and literate force of this classic. It is a remarkable book that stands with the work of Father Nouwen and even Father Louie. If you read it you will recommend it.</span>

                    <span>"I want to be a believer with passion and intelligence - and that longing always leads me into a desert place, a place of emptiness and death. And it is there that I begin to learn how to love" (quote from SoulMaking). Jones' book offers soul-food for the spiritual seekers. He explores the dark night of the soul that all believers experience; the times without like-minded fellowship where spirituality is defined solely by intimacy with God.</span>
