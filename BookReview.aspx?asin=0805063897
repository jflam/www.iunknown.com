                <span id="Label1"><div><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, and one of the most talked about books of the year, Ni<i>ckel and Dimed</i> has already become a classic of undercover reportage.</b><br><br>Millions of Americans work for poverty-level wages, and one day Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that any job equals a better life. But how can anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 to $7 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich moved from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, taking the cheapest lodgings available and accepting work as a waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing-home aide, and Wal-Mart salesperson. She soon discovered that even the "lowliest" occupations require exhausting mental and physical efforts. And one job is not enough; you need at least two if you intend to live indoors.<br><br><i>Nickel and Dimed</i> reveals low-wage America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity -- a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate strategies for survival. Instantly acclaimed for its insight, humor, and passion, this book is changing the way America perceives its working poor.<br></div></span>

                    <span>Barbara Ehrenreich takes an inside look at what it's like to be one of the "working poor." She spent three months at three widely differing locations (Key West, Portland ME, and Minneapolis, MN) trying to make a go of it working for 6-7 dollars per hour. In spite of her advantages of good health, education, a car, and a fund to supply her with a deposit on a rental; she needed to work two jobs, seven days a week to barely survive.<P>Two points that struck me over and over were 1) no matter where you go, there is NO affordable housing and 2) during possibly the most prosperous decade in the century, wages never increased on the lower end of the job scale (fast food, retail clerking, waitressing, house cleaning). Though at almost every Wendy's and Wal-Mart across the country, there are big "Help Wanted" signs, the wages are and remain at a flat six to seven dollars an hour. <P>The author does an excellent job of describing her various job duties, many of them far more complex than you would ever dream, and humanizing her fellow workers and her interactions with them. The crunch for many people is the inability to put up a rental deposit plus the first month's rent for a place to live. The practice of the large chains and fast food industry of deferring the first week's pay for a week or ten days is frequently devastating. Advising people to cook up a big stew and make their own bread to cut food expenses is quite beside the point when they have nowhere to cook. Ms. Ehrenreich points out general health is poor because they rarely have health insurance and cannot afford to take any time off for illness. The work is usually strenuous, and bad backs and pulled muscles are endemic.<P>The author has a built-in bias against people who do not clean their own houses. Her trials and tribulations as a housecleaner are sometimes unintentionally funny, but the grueling work and the indignities suffered are very real. Her solutions are breathtaking in scope and possibly too sweeping to have a chance of fulfillment. However, the ever-increasing disparity between "working poor" and "lower-middle class" must be addressed and acted upon soon before we have a huge transient peasant class always on the verge of homelessness.<P>The next time you drive by a beautifully "gentrified" section of your town, ask yourself "where did the poor people go?" And keep in mind, that person "flipping burgers at Mickey D's" is working long, grueling hours on their feet for very little pay. "Nickel and Dimed" is highly readable. It may make you uncomfortable, but it is well worth the time.</span>

                    <span>Most of the people who have submitted negative reviews about this book apparently didn't get past the crucial first five pages. In the author's own words: "this is not some sort of death-defying "undercover" adventure. Almost anyone could do what I did - Look for jobs, work those jobs, try to make ends meet. In fact, millions of Americans do it every day, and with a lot less fanfare and dithering." Instead of giving us a lurid "Dateline"- style expose of working-class existence, Ehrenreich offers something much more vital: a highly detailed and intimate account of the psychological and physical toll that service-sector jobs demand of their employees. If Ehrenreich, as a healthy, educated white woman with no dependents could barely afford substandard housing while working two jobs, it's a telling indication that, for many of her overburdened coworkers, gainful employment remains frustratingly out of reach.<P>Moreover, it's unfair to say that Ehrenreich panders to liberal sensibilities without offering viable solutions to working-class hardships. In a characteristically lively and informative fashion, she makes a series of persuasive arguments about working-class problems. Among other things, she proposes a wider availability of affordable housing and comprehensive health care plans, a living wage, and especially an abandonment of "middle management" techniques that leave laborers feeling like inmates in a prison.<P>At a time when dot-com millionaires and cheery news reports about the rising middle class abound, it's refreshing to have someone like Ehrenreich illustrate so dramatically that many of the problems that have plagued generations of working class citizens still persist.</span>

                    <span>This case study in, as the subtitle says "(Not) Getting by in America" was in many ways surprising. I thought I had a pretty good handle on the fact that there are people in desperate straits out there, that being in desperate straights is awful, and that it would be better if no one had to do it. But some of the problems that are described in this book were things I had never even thought of. One of her main contentions is that many of the working poor are borderline homeless, living, ironically, in expensive motels because they can never get far enough ahead to save the deposit for a real apartment. The lack of medical care and desperate penny-pinching wasn't surprising, but what struck me was that the author, daughter of a union organizer and left wing journalist, was consistently surprised at the importance that her co-workers placed on the jobs they were doing, quite apart from the monetary rewards or managerial incentives. <P>This struck me as especially tragic, because it just reinforces the fact that most people take satisfaction in doing something well, and it's obvious from the lives these people lead that they aren't in the habit of shirking work. Shouldn't hard, quality work bring you a life with the basics we should all have? A thought provoking, if not especially surprising book.</span>

                    <span>I read this book 3 years ago, and I'm STILL experiencing recall and flashbacks to some of its passages. For example: I might be doing nothing much in particular, as I set myself down to dinner at a family style restaurant...and WHAP!!! I will recall a passage from "Nickled and Dimed" concerning the not very pretty or easy plight of many waitresses and cooks who work at such establishments. And "Nickled and Dimed" does it all with a sense of humour, to boot! <P>Very thought provoking and enlightening for anyone who wants a better understanding the working poor and the flaws in our socio-economic system.<P>"Nickled and Dimed" should be required reading for every politician and social worker in the United States.</span>

                    <span>The biggest problem with the "realism" here is the fact that the author knows, throughout all of it, that she will be going back to her 'real' job and some serious money along with her yuppie lifestyle. She doesn't even pretend to want to find out how it feels to live this life for real. Try having $5.00 in your pocket on the 2nd of January to last you the rest of the month, with 2 babies crying because there isn't any heat in your house. And then come to the realization that you REALLY only have $5.00 in your pocket with 2 crying babies and no heat. And try realizing that the reason you are in this situation is because your town was hit by a flash flood that wiped your home away and your insurance company refused to cover the damages because they don't cover "floods." Suddenly you are poor and desperate and nowhere to turn. Try that. Then write your book. The only problem would be finding someone to publish it. The general public still doesn't want to hear about the true struggles of the working poor or what the circumstances were that lead to that poverty... they only want to be entertained and feel "enlightened" because they now "understand the plight of the poor." Sorry... you really don't. Next time you sit down to a full meal, consider there really are people out there eating ketchup on noodles and nothing else. All week... maybe even all month.</span>
