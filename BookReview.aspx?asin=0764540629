                    <span>I recently picked this book up after I tasked myself with developing a quoting system for my company.  I've had some exposure to VBA before, but only small segments such as a message or input box, simple forms, etc.
<br />
<br />Immediately after sitting down with this book I was impressed.  Mr. Aitken writes in a clear, concise, and very logical manner that I found easy to follow.  Topics are presented well and for the most part given adequate treatment.  Some may say the book is too basic, but it's not meant to be an advanced programming course.
<br />
<br />In a little over three days, I was able to completely program a sales quoting system using multiple screens, worksheet linking, and simple database tables.  Now, instead of hand-writing and calculating associated costs (which often leads to errors) the user is systematically prompted for key inputs and all calculations are done in the background.  I've reduced administrative time required to complete a quote by over 25%.
<br />
<br />Not bad for a weekend project!

                    <span>This book is extreemly frustrating as it tells you what excel can do, gives brief formulas but then does not show you how to use them in detail so it can be difficult in trying to acheive the result with the given formulas.

                    <span>I bought this book based on the reviews and summary because it sounds like a book that a beginner could really learn from.  But not so.  I've made it to chapter four but I'm finding I can go on no longer.  This book is basically straight text.  There are no step by step lessons to demonstrate what the lesson is talking about.  The book does provide some sample code, but it is presented as an example; you do not build it yourself.  This book tells you what to do, but you don't get your hands dirty by actually writing codes yourself and then seeing what the code does.
<br />
<br />I will say this though.  The text itself is well written and is readable enough, given the dry nature of the subject.  But I do feel this is more of a reference book for beginners.  I'm going to buy the Microsoft step-by-step book, then come back to this book. 
<br />
<br />I'm giving it two stars simply because I do not believe this book is what it claims to be, a weekend crash course.
