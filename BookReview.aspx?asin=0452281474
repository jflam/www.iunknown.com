                <span id="Label1">Bizarre facts, uproariously funny photos, and goofy trivia for the '80s movie fan<br><br>For people who came of age watching <i>Footloose</i>, <i>Dirty Dancing</i>, and <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, <i>Say Anything</i> is a funny and completely addictive book that tests just how much of an '80s buff one really is. Not since <i>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</i> (Plume) have movie fanatics been handed such a humorous tool for testing their archives of trivia knowledge. Here's how it works: readers get a single line from an '80s film and then are asked to guess the name of the movie and the character and/or actor who made the line famous.<br><br>With more than five hundred memorable quotes, plus special theme sections on topics like "slasher flicks," John Hughes' movies, and the brilliant career of Molly Ringwald, <i>Say Anything</i> is the perfect handbook for the '80s pop-culture junkie.</span>

                    <span>These incouragable fellows have done it again! An exceptional representaion of this impish decade is presented in a masterful manner by Peter Thomas and Frank. My temples almost imploded due to laughter when I read Peter Thomas' justification of the "Lompom Twins". I also almost seared myself after reading the "Ode to Russ" and all its colossal wisdom. No human could expand on this phenomenon as well as Peter Thomas and Frank. Kudos my green friends! Keep up the great work.</span>

                    <span>I had so much fun reading this book that I got a hernia! Peter Thomas and Frank present their wizadry in such a way that one could never mistake them for proprietors. They suckle the "teets" of the 80's cow until only powdered milk would resolve their finance. Undeniably, the highlight of this book is when Peter Thomas takes his shot at the musty moguls known as the "Lompom Twins"! Boy, did I laugh!</span>

                    <span>This book is tremendously funny. I love Peter Thomas and Frank's candid approach towards the uninspiring decade that we know as the eighties. This book helped me get through a couple of tough years upstate at Elmira State Penitentiary. Since, I've been released, I've gained a new perspective on life and have Peter Thomas and Frank to thank. You good men have made a better man out of me through levity and humor. At first, the days were long and dreary but when my C.O. lent me that book, the days became brighter. I needed to keep it!<P>THANKS AGAIN! You will always be in my thoughts!</span>
