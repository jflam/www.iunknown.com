With attention to fascinating detail, and an intense knowledge of her subject and its characters, Ms. Tuchman reveals, for the first time, just how the war started, why, and why it could have been stopped but wasn't. A classic historical survey of a time and a people we all need to know more about, THE GUNS OF AUGUST will not be forgotten.<br></span>

                    <span>Tuchman's book is a classic for several reasons. If one does not know much about WW 1, her book is a terrific place to begin. For me, it answered two of the key mysteries of the war: why did the assassination of the Austrian heir apparent so quickly develop into a world-wide conflagration; and why were the Allies so angry at Germany that they imposed reparations that crippled it for years, ultimately leading to WW 2? Tuchman handles both issues wonderfully, in fact, devoting 2 chapters to each of those issues. In so doing, she brings the key characters of the drama to full life, most interesting of them being stubborn Sir John French, leader of the British Expeditionary Forces; French General Joffre with his numerous insecurities; brave King Albert of Belgium; and indepedent French General Lanrezac. Once again, Tuchman reminds us all too well that history is made up of personalities. There are times in which mediocre people rise to unusual challenges and become heroes. There are far too many other times in which people of stature and position sink miserably into mediocrity. World War One was one such occasion.</span>

                    <span>Although we think of the First World War in terms of the stalemate and carnage of the trenches, for the first few weeks of combat, it was a war of movement. The battlelines shifted daily and the British and French came closer to disaster than I realized before I read this book. It's a gripping story, which Tuchman tells superbly. The political and military leaders come alive, the maps are clear, and even though you know how the story ends, you can't put the book down. Tuchman is also a reliable: I didn't find any factual errors. My complaints are minor. I agree with the previous writer who thought that the book ended too early: the war of movement in the west really ended with the French counterattack on the Marne, which is not discussed in the same detail as the campaign that led to it. Also, while Tuchman, presumably legitimately, dismisses the story of the angels of Mons as a legend, she should have told us what the legend was. Overall, however, I thought that the book was great, and I strongly recommend it even to those readers who think they know the story after reading such popular histories of the First World War as those by John Keegan or Martin Gilbert. You'll be surprised how you learn.</span>

                    <span>Whoa! I loved this book. I like Keegan's books, too. It's hard to say which is best. Tuchman describes a lot of personalites. Keegan has more relevant facts and explore strategies better. I read both auhors will equal fervor. I plan to read her "Stillwell and the American Experience in China".<P>I've lent this book to several other non-history buffs and they can't get past page 50. Obvioulsy they will not be going to Amazon and entering a 1 star rating!<P>You should love history before opening the book.</span>

                    <span>Es sencillamente un libro magnifico, facil de leer, aun para quienes no somos angloparlantes, muy didactico, donde parece que los actores de ese momento estuvieran hoy entre nosotros. <BR>Fue a traves de esta obra que comence a interesarme sobre la Primera Guerra Mundial, sobre todo porque uno va entrando en forma paulatina en la voragine de los sucesos que llevaron al conflicto. La descripcion de las potencias antes del inicio de la guerra es sencilla, clara, pero no por eso menos interesante.<P>Esta primera etapa de descripcion de la situacion fue quiza la que mas me gusto y me llevo a leer otros libros relacionados. Los capitulos relativos a los primeros combates estan bien desarrollados y a uno le permiten visualizar como seguira en el tiempo la contienda.<P>He leido tres libros de la Sra. Tuchman y me parece que este es el mejor de todos, sin desmerecer al Zimmermann Telegram que me parecio tambien estupendo.</span>

                    <span>...<P>The book lays out the facts.<P>The Germans murdered thousands of Belgian and French civilians, 99.99999% for no reason other than to "inspire" the fear that the doctrine of terrorism the "Grosser Generalstab" had inculcated into its commanders and troops.<P>The exposes the dithering stupidity of much of the British cabinet--how can that be "pro" British in the sense of bias? Of course, it can't.<P>It also demonstrates the tragic stupidity--there's no other word for it--of French politics and military planning during the Third Republic (1871-1940) and shows quite clearly that had the "offensive a l'outrance" had been abandoned for trench systems along the entire French border from Switzerland to the Channel, the Germans would have been stopped cold in Belgium and the French and British would have been fighting from the high ground--rather than the other way around.<P>For anyone to call stating the cold, hard facts about the crimes of the Imperial German Army, is an insult to the thousands they murdered and to the only thing this book is about: the truth!<P>So, neo-Nazis be gone! This book is about the truth, something you're not interested in.<P>Germany was clearly, completely and totally at fault. Nothing in her strategic posture demanded hooking the "Reich's" fate to the tottering, imminent collapse of the Austrian Empire. Bismarck regarded the idea with horror and did all he could to distance Germany from creaking, bellicose Austria and her sociopathic commander-in-chief Conrad von Hoetzendorff.<P>And yes, Mrs. Tuchman is pro democracy and pro-freedom--ideals few of Germany's pre-1914 elite held dear. And, yes, she is against shooting 6 month old babies in the head as the Germans did in Belgium. <P>As Sir John Keegan points out, in his excellent "the First World War" (despite the bizarre and irrelevant criticism of this book by obviously weakly informed reviewer, is fantastic and MUST be on every student's shelf), everywhere the Germans went in France and Belgium, villages and towns were burned--sometimes cities, e.g Louvain--women, children, babies and old men were systematically shot--not by special death squads, but by members of some of the premiere regiments of the German Army (e.g. The Prussian Foot Guards, the "Big Red One" of the German Army).<P>In almost every town in Belgium and the northern 1/4 of France occupied by them you can find grave stones with the inscription...<P>"fusillie par les Allemands"<P>"Shot dead by the Germans."<P>And, next to those whose death are marked 1914 is entirely new and much larger contention of graves with the very same words, only the date, 1940, changes.<P>You see, in both wars, the Germans engaged in systematic war crimes and crimes against humanity.<P>It took the destruction of their cities and the deaths of 9 million German men from 1914-1945 to convince our Teutonic cousins that they would never be allowed to conquer the planet.<P>Mrs. Tuchman presents this with calm, studied prose that diminished none of the horror nor conceals the deeply moral center that drove this woman's life and work.<P>Criticism is either revisionism or foolishness. This book is for the ages.</span>
