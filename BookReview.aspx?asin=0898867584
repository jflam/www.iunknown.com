                    <span>I bought "100 Hikes in Utah" for my daughter and her fiance because I thought it would be perfect for them. They have discovered the beauty of nature in Utah, especially in the southern part with the cliffs and rock formations. <BR> <BR>This is a very well-written guide to the 100 places Steve and Rhett have explored. They know what they're doing, and their experience and love of the outdoors is evident throughout the book. <P>I like how each chapter is set up with information right at the beginning of the article on every site, telling the reader about the distance round trip, hiking time, difficulty range, best season to go, etc. The articles give great detail about the journey, with tips such as camp sites, water sources, and scenery throughout. There are many wonderful pictures throughout the book. I only wish they had been in color since it's clear the views are spectacular. (Check out the hair-raising photo on page 98!)<P>I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in hiking the beautiful landscape of Utah. Be sure to take this book along with you.</span>

                    <span>This otherwise excellent guide is seriously compromised by a major omission. For hiking in the west it is really important to know the maximum and minimum elevations of a trail. This book lists the elevation gain, but amazingly and foolishly does not tell you at what altitude the hike begins and ends. This is such a serious (and needless) blunder that I would not recommend the book.</span>
