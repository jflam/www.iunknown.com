                    <span>In common with many other readers I have found this title to be really useful and after a brief period of re-organisation of my working practices, I've entered a more productive and useful faze of my life. Using the powerful techniques of in-box, breaking tasks down and especially the 2 minute rule as part of the easy to use system that dave allen has designed, I now run my home baking business far more productively than ever before.
<br />
<br />As a diabetic, and a baker I've also developed some additional blood sugar micro-management techniques that mesh well with Dave's great system. There's just no point in being on top of everything unless you've the energy and more importantly the correct level of available blood sugar to follow through with prompt and effective action. I recommend sesame snaps as a light weight alternative to help ensure that potential productivity gains are realised with a health giving and nutritional micro-meal. </span>

                    <span>The steps are simple, the concepts are simple but the system works. The hardest part I'm having is developing the habits to keep my inbox clean. I sometimes find myself slipping into my old habit of leaving e-mails in my inbox without making a decision on how to handle it. This however is my own default and doesn't really speak to the effectiveness of this system.
<br />
<br />I've managed to keep on top of more stuff than I ever had in my life. People at work certainly notice that I'm in control of my assignments and I've been given a bigger project to manage because of it. It's actually very exciting to know that I have the tools and skills to cope with the added work load and not get stressed out that things will slip or drop.
<br />
<br />I only gave the book 4 stars because I found the material sometimes hard to get through. I often found myself losing interest in the writing. I'd suggest that if you feel the same, stick with it, the rewards are worth it.
<br />
<br />Most of the self help books I've been reading leave a lot of how-to out of them, trying to build a dependency so that the reader will go buy more of the authors material. Not so with Mr Allen. The complete system is here for you to use. Also his website has some pretty great articles as well.

                    <span>This book, though not directly focused on writing, presents one of the most useful sets of tools I use as a business writer. Allen's book has been invaluable in helping me learn to manage my writing, and much of the rest of my life. It's on the short list of recommended resources in my book The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Business Writing and Communication.

                    <span>Getting Things Done provides a great concrete framework for how to manage your pending work in an external, easy to access, and easy to keep up to date form. I've personally adopted it and love both the freedom that it gives me and the flexibility that it has in what can be on paper, electronic, or a pile of stuff. I look at it more as some techniques than specific practies.
<br />
<br />The caution I have about this book -- which I actually would recommend, despite the 3 star rating -- is that the techniques without a framework might not be quite enough. For instance, if you're a Seven Habits fan, you'll also get some guidance around prioritizing work, saying "no" to things, and ensuring long-term success. GTD is more focused on managing work you think is on your plate and handling whatever comes up, whether you really should or not. I've also found that I need to manage my long-term "nice to have" projects incrementally and don't really buy Allen's statement that you would be surprised how much progress you make on them just by writing them down. Finally, though I agree that putting a big list of tasks onto a day to get them done can be demoralizing, I do like to do things like block out hours of my calendar to work on tasks.
<br />
<br />So, a good book, a worthy read, but I'd advise that you also read some of the other literature in this area to make sure that you're not just learning to spin your wheels faster. Driving more quickly doesn't help if you're pointed through a minefield and in the wrong direction.</span>

                    <span>I got this book because I thought it had some interesting things that I didn't already know... and... it doesn't. In fact, I'm still struggling to finish the book (I've read about 3/4th of it... and I just can't get the damn thing done---so much for the title of the book, heh?)
<br />
<br />Yes, the book does have some tips, but it's annoying to read. You know how when you read magazines, you have these "quotes" from the text on the margins?, well, there are quotes from the text on the margins in this book too. Very annoying. It's like reading a long, never-ending magazine article.
<br />
<br />The key point of this book is: get things out of your head. That's it. (well, he has some tips on how to organize things) In short, you should write things down, and do little things right away. If you do that, you'll spend less time worrying about doing things ('cause everything that needs to be remembered is written down, and if you handle little things right away, then there won't be that many things on your list). ie: Obvious stuff.
<br />
<br />If you're a procrastinator (like me), don't expect this book to change your your life in any way (except possibly consume some of your time to read it).</span>
