                    <span>We see a great deal of order in living systems.  Where does this order come from?  Is it entirely from natural selection?  The author says no.  He explains that much of the order we see in the world is spontaneous, such as in the symmetry of snowflakes, and that much of the order needed for the origination of life and in living organisms is of this spontaneous nature.
<br />
<br />Kauffman is making a non-trivial point here, as the extent to which spontaneous order is more important than selected order is not entirely obvious.  While a snowflake is indeed an example of a system that is highly ordered as it gets synthesized, that's not true of, say, a solar system, in which short-lived bodies quickly depart the scene in favor of long-lived ones.  It's clearly significant that disordered entities tend to be shorter-lived and unable to replicate.
<br />
<br />The author then addresses theories of the origin of life.  Could it have started with RNA?  After all, replicating RNA could then produce the needed proteins.  Kauffman says no.   The amino acid chains one would need would be too long to replicate accurately enough (the "error catastrophe").  I tend to agree.  Besides, RNA is awfully fragile (DNA is not fragile).  And once one hypothesizes that RNA has a template to keep it safe, one's theory is that templates came first.  
<br />
<br />Of course, the "error catastrophe" is devastating if the minimum complexity of a living cell is rather large.  Kauffman argues that this minimum complexity is indeed large, and that it is no accident that there are hundreds of genes in pleuromona, perhaps the simplest free-living (non-virus) organism.  
<br />
<br />Spontaneous order also refutes the argument of Hoyle and Wickramasinghe that life could not have arisen on Earth because the chance of creating the 2000 functioning enzymes would be too small: 1 in 10 to the 40,000.  Well, given that life does exist here, the Hoyle argument is almost certainly wrong anyway (with a chance that small, the odds would be overwhelmingly small for life to arise anywhere, ever, so the chance that the argument is wrong must be huge, since a correct argument might then give a much higher probability for life to appear).
<br />
<br />The author then asks how we get the large polymers we need.  After all, life is basically autocatalysis (that's what I was taught in the 1960s, and that's what Kauffman says as well).  How does this big autocatalytic set get into gear?  The author makes an analogy to putting connectors between random pairs of entities.  At first the length of a connected chain will be small.  But once the number of connections is about half the number of entities, the longest chain quickly becomes almost as large as the number of entities.   That raises the question of how all these entities can interact, but Kaufmann says that having reactions on a substrate, effectively reducing the region to two dimensions, helps.  So does having less water around.  
<br />
<br />We then get to the question of homeostasis.  That requires plenty of order.  Is there a way to get that order "for free?"  The author says there is, and here is where he makes his most dramatic point.  He points out that a network with 100,000 entities (call them "light bulbs") with two states each, has 10 to the 30,000 possible states.  One might expect such a network to cycle through the square root of the number of states, or 10 to the 15,000.  But it actually tends to cycle through the square root of the number of binary variables, which is only the square root of 100,000 or about 317.   That is a huge amount of "order for free!"   And it argues strongly for life's origination to be unsurprising.  As Kauffman puts it, this changes life on Earth from being "We, the improbable," to "We the expected." 
<br />
<br />There's plenty more in this fine book.  The author discusses order in ontogeny.  And he has a chapter on the relationship between the diversity of species in an ecosystem and the diversity of organic molecules added from outside.  And there's also plenty of material on "fitness landscapes." 
<br />
<br />One question that arises in this book is statistical: how long does a species tend to last?  That has implications for the question of how long humans will last.  It may not be that long.  But that doesn't bother me, as long as we're replaced with something better.  After all, I'm for progress!

                    <span>This particular book is a fantastic revelation and study of the boundary between order and chaos as it applies to the evolution of life, culture, technology and anything else in the universe.  Its goal is to seek a universal law regarding the emergence of order in what we've traditionally considered unordered or random sets of fundamental stuff.  For example, one of the observations that it makes is that evolution as Darwin revealed it is by itself not a sufficient explanation (scientifically) for why and how creatures like us could be here at all.  In other words, natural selection is not sufficient to accomplish what life has accomplished in this world of ours.  It needed the help of a very important other "force"... the life force, I might call it, and to which I've alluded many times in many forms through my writings.  It's that special something about the nature of the universe that brings about the cooperation of systems, the autocatalytic closure which makes "hanging together" and "existing" some sort of "goal" deeply encoded in the nature of it all.  You might be able to see how I might identify these ideas very closely with that term "lifetoward".  What goal-oriented force brought life to be and continues to make life strive for ever more order and complexity?  This book answers I think very well with: it's not a force, per se, but rather a fundamental aspect of the basic nature of the universe.  To quote the book, "We the expected."  We as living beings belong here and are an integral part of an incredibly awe inspiring process of creation of meaning and order in a world aching to give birth to it.  The book closes with a nice summary, which much like a message I had posted to the lifetoward@yahoogroups.com list some time ago, extols the development of a new and enlightened faith, based on a realization of the wonder of the way the universe deeply is and how we are in it.<p>In terms of the meaning and importance of this book, I would recommend it to everyone.  However, I will warn you that it may be a significant challenge to read.  It calls on a deeply considered understanding of a variety of disciplines, including most notably evolutionary biology, organic chemistry, mathematics, anthropology, and economics.  It proceeds with an assumption that the reader has realized or can quickly recognize the common ground between these different areas of study.  It uses a lot of mathematical models and visualizations of 2, 3 and hyperdimensional spaces to discuss the nature of this common law and its emergence in the world around us.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Kauffman is a complexity theorist/mathematical biologist.  The most intriguing concept in this book is that of an autocatalytic set: put enough kinds of organic molecules, which possibly could be developed by non-organic means, in a self contained space, which can arise in various ways, and a system with the properties of life will emerge with reasonable probability.  This is just one example of a self-organizing system. Another important idea is the importance of the boundary between sub-critical and super-critical regions of  a dynamic system: if super-critical there is chaotic change, if sub-critical there may not be enough flexibility to adapt.  Organisms  have evolved so mutation rates  lay near the boundary, but still in the sub-critical area, and it is characteristic of successful ecosystems. There is an explanation of why it is natural and logical that all the current phyla, and many more extinct ones, arose in the Cambrian period or "immediately" after, even though in the subsequent Permian extinction, for example, 96% of species became extinct, to be replaced by new ones.  While sometimes repetitious, Kaufman's prose would often do a novelist proud, and he is excellent in explaining abstract concepts, using images and graphs to good effect.  He is particularly good at explaining the work of others.  He has a very likable personality  and is great in giving credit to others, eminent scientists as well as Emily Dickinson (a computer scientist who worked for him). Why then did I not like this book even more than I did?   A major problem for me is that Kauffman's passion is for the logic, not the biology, and I would have  appreciated additional fleshing out of his models in their biological context.  His application of his models to other areas  such as technology are sometimes interesting, but not always; sometimes, what he thinks is a new insight is hardly new at all: cf.  his discussion of  the use of a set of sub-optimizations to solve one large optimization problem.  Finally, I found his discussion of ontogeny very confusing: recalling his image, I understood that there were a number of sub-systems of flashing green lights  of varying size(corresponding to cell types), so how does the total number of green lights  relates to the time for cell division?</span>

                    <span>This book is written from a biological perspective, which is not where my interests lie.  Perhaps if my background were different, I would have given it an additional star.<p>The greatest benefit I received from this book was exposure to a whole new subject area (self organization).  After reading the book, I moved on to read several other books about emergent behaviour which is more along the lines of my interests.<p>It served me well to open my eyes to a different way of thinking.  The other books I have read have served me better as they are not primarily biologically based.</span>

                    <span>Kauffman's book provides a clear description of self-organizing systems, the emergence of life, fitness landscapes, and evolution.  It is written for the well-educated layperson, but if you want to see some of the associated math, refer to Kauffman's other book, or simply google e.g. "NK-landscape".  I highly recommend this book.  And if you like this book, see also Rare Earth and Chaisson's Cosmic Evolution.</span>
