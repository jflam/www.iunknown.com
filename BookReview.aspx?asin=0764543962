                    <span>The first thing you'll notice is that the book is mainly concentrated using vb.net. That is fine, but looking at the code as a c++, c#, java programmer just begins to drive me nuts. If you want the c# examples, you have to download them. If you like to write the code to help you learn, this book is not for you. Chapters 5 and 6 are almost wholly useless as far as examples go, but a decent read for understanding how asp.net works. The web services and mobile controls were nice. The datastore chapters were good for understanding asp.net. I would have expected to see more OO design in the professional book. If you have an asp.net book already, this won't bring many new revelations to you. If you are looking for a single asp.net book, this is a decent one to have. If you are beginning asp.net, this book is not for you, as the examples just aren't concise or clear enough.<P>In short the book isn't worth it if you have some asp.net books already. If you are developing with asp.net currently, this may be a decent reference. However, you might find more use using MSDN for reference. A sub par wrox book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The authors of this book clearly took a lot of time to ensure that the content is relevant to real-world developers, and it shows. Through the use of pertinent examples and sample code, even the most complex topics are understandable. The portions of the book that relate to data access (Chapters 8-11) were particularly useful, as ADO.NET is very powerful, but takes time to really understand. Often, I'd find myself wondering, "but what if I want to...", and the next section would answer the question. If you're looking for procedural information about how to just do the bare minimum to get an application running, this isn't the book for you. If, instead, you'd like to truly understand how ASP.NET and it's MANY features work, I would highly recommend buying and reading this book. I know I'll be referring to the content for the next several months.</span>

                    <span>oh, I hope that the authors read my review. This could me the best ASP.NET book in the market but it isn't. Many pages, many chapters and many information but all these need time to manage and arrange. I think that the former publishing company just wanted to publish 1000+ book. Please in the future try to make in better. Something like Professional ASP.NET using C# and Professional ASP.NET using VB.NET. And please authors not more than 1000 in the same book.<P>Alghough I like many of the former wrox's titles.<BR>Michael Youssef<BR>Microsoft.NET Architect/Trainer</span>

                    <span>This book is 1300 pages of [stuff]. Its written by about 10 people who obviously didn't look at each others segments because they repeat the same stuff over and over. If they took out all the information that was repeated throughout the book it would be about 300 pages. I was better served by the MSDN documentation. Wrox used to have a good reputation for solid books but it seems like quantity over quality is what they are after.</span>
