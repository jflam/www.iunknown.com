                <span id="Label1"> Most Web applications follow a simple "3F" pattern: fetch, format, and forward data to the browser. With this in-depth guide, developers can take their Web design and programming skills to the next level to build more complex Web pages, applications, and services. The book demonstrates the advanced data-access capabilities of ADO.NET and the powerful page-creation capabilities of ASP.NET, plus how to employ code reusability, pagelets, code-behind, server-side controls, and other time-saving techniques. </span>

                    <span>This is not an intermediate book:<p>The author knows what he is talking about. Perhaps he made it overly complex, he goes in to great detail and some of it is overkill. I started reading it and I knew that I needed to get another book that simplifies some of the subjects and I would use this book when I need to get to the gritty details. I was rather disappointed that there was no Visual Basic .NET code. The author clearly is a C# expert. I may change my review once I read the whole book, I am sure I will appreciate his thoroughness once I have a grasp of ASP.NET.</span>

                    <span>This is quite a good book on real techniques to solve real problems. It's still going to be useful if you use for you're development third party controls and frameworks, you still will find valuable information inside. I wouldn't recommend it for the very beginner that wants a Learn-This-In-1-Hour book (and keep yourself in the ignorance :-)).<p>For anybody else with certain degree of familiarity with the .Net environment, the book is going to be extremely useful.</span>

                    <span>If you ever wanted a handsdown, no nonsense approach to ASP.NET then go get this book! It's well worth the money. Dino walks you through most of the major controls e.g Repeaters, DataLists and DataGrids. Particular emphasis is given on how to make use of Databound controls, especially DataGrids.<p>Dino makes learning functionalities like Paging, Editing, ItemCommands, Sorting, plus some extra features thrown in - like the chapter on developing your own super grid a breeze. The super grid that was introduced will surely be the template used by every .NET developer.<p>A whole segment is dedicated to the intracacies of the DataSets and how to maximize its usage and the relationship between DataAdapters and DataSet. Those of you who are taking 70-305 tests might wanna take this book a look as well. As I've just completed the test and this book helped alot!<p>As someone who has been developing ASP for awhile this book is indispensable in exposing new techniques as well as breaking old habits that goes with developing on ASP. For example, the usage of StringBuilders, rather than concatenating strings all over your code.<p>Towards the end, there's some fair bit on WebServices and a final introductory chapter on how to write your own DataAdapters, both these topics by right can be a book in it self. So its definately a bonus.<p>In summary. 5 stars mate!</span>
