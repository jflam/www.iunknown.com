                    <span>The purpose of Nessus is to provide an Open Source Solution for network auditing on all Unix like systems.  This book not only details using Nessus but also comes with a CD containing the program, as well as Ethereal, Snort, and Newt (a port of the program to the Windows environment).
<br />
<br />What is a network assessment?  At its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment, services, applications, and vulnerabilities on that system.  Basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external.  An internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the LAN.  Nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either, or both of them.
<br />
<br />The authors do an excellent job of detailing installation, setup, and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report.  One of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system.  Some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows, default passwords, backdoors, information leaks, and denial of service.
<br />
<br />The Nessus scripting language is covered in detail in Appendix A instead of the main portion of the book; a choice I appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section.  With Open Source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help.  So, the authors include information on how to get help via the Nessus User Community, mailing lists, and archives.
<br />
<br />Nessus Network Auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality.</span>

                    <span>This book is the only game in town when it comes to nessus.  The information it contains should be regarded as mandatory knowledge for those running nessus in a professional environment.  This book is about more than just nessus.  It is about an approach to network auditing and vulnerability assessment.
<br />
<br />The first few chapters are largely introductory and cover vulnerability assessment and nessus basics.  The next few chapters cover more basics including running a scan, interpreting results, and vulnerability types.  
<br />
<br />The latter chapters cover areas of interest to an experienced nessus user.  The chapter on false positives begs to be read.  The authors offer a logical approach to dealing with false positives that most organizations lack.  The remaining chapters detail the inner workings of nessus (knowledge base, nasl, plugin writing), enterprise scanning, and the nessus user community.  
<br />
<br />This book provides a through explanation of the tool.  Enough information is given to start writing your own custom security checks.  However, I did find myself wanting for a little more technical substance (especially in the plug-in writing/nasl area), but maybe that's just me.  This book has a decent index that helps with reference.  This book will benefit the beginner and experienced user alike.

                    <span>If you are, or are considering, using Nessus in a wide-scale/enterprise scanning infrastructure you will likely find everything you need to know in this book. If you are, or are considering, using Nessus for ad-hoc assessments (or penetration tests), this book will indeed provide a lot of valuable information but at a price: you'll have to read the whole thing to glean all the useful tips and you'll end up spending a lot of time getting intimately familiar with what's probably going to be just one of very many tools in your toolbox, getting only a fraction of your attention in each assessment. If you're new to vulnerability assessment or penetration testing (not just to Nessus) you should really read a few other books first, even though this one does contain some useful info on testing in general, for example, how to identify false positives and negatives.
<br />
<br />There's a lot of good content but it tends to be all over the place--numerous sidebars and tables throughout are usually in context but could also have been placed elsewhere. The style, however, seems fairly consistent considering the book had 10 contributing authors and three editors, one of which is the creator of the subject of the book. Unfortunately Jay Beale, whose name appears prominantly on the cover, is merely an editor--a shame since I typically find his articles in Information Security magazine well-written and informative.
<br />
<br />There are a just a couple downsides to this book. Like several other current Syngress titles it suffers from poor quality printing and paper with some very tiny and/or fuzzy screen shots, large print, and lack of whitespace--making it a little hard on the eyes. It also really would have been nice if it had included a CD with the current version of Nessus on it, since that's what the book's about after all.</span>

                    <span>'Nessus Network Auditing' (NNA) is the definitive (and only) guide to the Nessus open source vulnerability assessment tool.  I recommend all security professionals read this book.  You may start as a Nessus user, but the book will help you become part of the Nessus community.  
<br />
<br />NNA features twelve contributors, but it doesn't suffer the fate of other books with similar high author counts.  NNA manages to present fairly original material in each chapter, without a lot of overlap.  I credit the lead authors and editors for keeping the contributors on track.  They could have reduced the number of crashing printer stories, however.
<br />
<br />Several chapters stood out from the others.  Ch 1 explains the need for conducting vulnerability assessment.  Ch 3 makes a good case for always installing from source code and not trusting precompiled binaries.  Chs 8 and 9 deliver real value with insights into Nessus internals, such as scanning architecture and the Nessus Knowledge Base.  Ch 10 presents crude albeit workable ways to measure bandwidth to alleviate loads caused by scans.  Ch 11 is an excellent rationale for the Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL) written by Nessus' creator.  I would have liked to have seen an appendix based on an actual (perhaps sanitized) scan, showing how a security admin selected tests, ran the scan, and validated results.
<br />
<br />NNA suffers a few problems.  A few typos are present, but nothing that distracts from the book's content.  I did find the ch 4 author's mention of the TCP "triple handshake" to be odd.  While not wrong, this process is usually called the "three-way handshake."  The screenshots in appendix B are of poor quality and should be replaced in future editions.  
<br />
<br />Note that the Nessus version used in NNA varies from 2.0.9 to 2.0.10a, and the current edition is 2.2.0.  Version creep is part of every technical book, and did not make a big difference at this point.  When Nessus 2.4 is released, watch for the adoption of the new BOSS GUI to clearly alter the face of the Nessus interface.
<br />
<br />Overall, NNA is an excellent technical resource for anyone charged with auditing network security.  I have a greater appreciation for the Nessus architecture and its ability to do more in-depth host checks.  Motivated readers can use this book to learn how to write their own NASL scripts and effectively deploy a distributed scanning architecture.</span>
