                    <span>The book explodes the myth of the 'good' versus the 'bad' Muslim and renders baseless US claims that the war on terror is a war between good and evil, civilized and uncivilized peoples. Mamdani locates the origins of terror in American Cold War foreign policy and shows how Al Qaeda is a product of American efforts to 'contain' and 'rollback' communism. These efforts did not just produce 'Afghan jihad' with all the pernicious apparatuses for terror supplied by the CIA, it also created conditions for the movement to grow into an independent organization targeting the Soviet infiltration of Afghanistan and later directing its ire against Egypt, Saudi Arabia and yes, the US. But for Mamdani, terror is not simply an anti-American thing; rather, on many occasions American terror has had equally devastating consequences in Angola, Mozambique and Nicaragua. Reading this book leads you to understand whose definition of terror is in operation at the moment and why this definition receives lukewarm support in the international community. Mamdani knowledge of Islam in general and political Islam in particular is exceptional and his analysis of different strands of Islamic thought in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria is meticulously matched by his understanding of political processes in these countries. A must read book if you want to think outside the 'you are either with us or against us'box.</span>

                    <span>Mr. Mamdani's book is a good read all through. His thesis is novel, arguments sound and conclusion is unbiased. His analysis of America's cold war policy of transition from containment to rollback is an eye-opener. Specially noteworthy is his observation of how covert operations undertaken during Reagan era in order to bypass obtaining funds from tax-payers' money through rampant act of aiding and abetting drug trafficking changed to Bush's approach of privatizing military with similar goal of keeping American people in dark regarding its imperial policy in Iraq and elsewhere. Also, his arguments showing parallel mind sets of imperial Europe and modern America regarding the practice of democratic despotism is laudable. European historians always argued in favor of colonizing "lower" races with the 'sacred' interest to civilise and enlighten them, the so called "White men's burden" (Rudyard Kippling) and that mass slaughter (genocide), mass starvation and plundering natural wealth and enslavement to feed industrial revolution in their home countries are but the 'collateral' damages. Similar 'collateral' damages inflicted on the Third world countries in the name of containment during cold war and globalisation following that era by America bears all the diagnostic features of imperial Europe. Finally, I share his frustration when he concludes by saying that whereas serious efforts are being made by the world at large to restrain the terrorism of Muslim origin, an absolute lack of similar efforts to check American and Israeli fundamentalism (the Judeo-Christian terrorism) gives a helpless feeling.</span>

                    <span>This is an excellent book rooting terrorism in its political/historical context and contingencies. Apart from "culture talk" which obscures more than it reveals, Prof. Mamdani provides a coherent theory for the development of al-Qaeda. The story started when the U.S. government chose to win the war against Communism with whatever means necessary. The main method after Vietnam was proxy wars and covert operations. Why? Because their conduct could be hidden from vigilant Congressional oversight and public scrutiny. The result was not only complicity in illicit trade (because covert operations cannot be easily financed by public funds) , but also the support of vicious terrorist groups and organizations that deliberately targeted civilians to undermine the "nationalist" governments they were fighting and, hence, brought into question their ability to provide safety and security for the citizens and their property. <P>Initially the U.S. government did not think of Islam as a challenger civilization. In fact Islam was perceived as anti-Communist and anti-nationalist. (Anti-nationlist before the Iranian revolution and the response to that was to back Iraq, despite its secular nationalism, because its brand of nationalism was sort of the lesser of the two evils.) Therefore, the Afghan Jihadis were wholeheartedly supported and even described as the moral equivalents of the Founding Fathers. The Jihadis were taught the state-of-the-art techniques of killing and destruction because they represented a tool to bleed the Soviet Union to death. <P>From there one can start the story of al-Qaeda which is often presented as if al-Qaeda appeared out of the blue. Terrorists are made, not born. The analysis of Prof. Mamdani is somewhat reductionist as it fails to address the internal circumstances of Muslim societies. However, it is a great step toward understanding the foundations of the catastrophes we are witnessing today.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is a well-documented & footnoted description of the process which spawned Al Qaeda and the global Jihadist movement. It carefully and painstakingly describes the roots, ideological, financial & social of Islamic Terrorism. Interestingly, most publications about these terror groups seem to assume that history ceases around 1988 or so. Mamdani shows how the period between the late 1970s and the late 1980s was the crucial period during which various players, including and in no small part directly resulting from the actions of, the United States. His discussions of the Reagan-era of "Rollback" in many countries culminating in Afghanistan and how the techniques used by proxy armies which were trained by the CIA is particularly thoughtful and well documented.<P>It is interesting to read other user posts who accuse mamdani of ignoring certain aspects of conventional US armed forces, such as the desire to and laudable attempts at avoiding civilian casualties. Because this book is largely about wars which were financed by the United States but fought by entities which were not made up of United States troops, this critique is essentially not valid since the target of Mamdani's examination is not conventional US troops.<P>There are a few examples of global al-jihad al-akbhar ("Lesser Jihad" or physical struggle, as opposed to "Greater Jihad" which is an internal personal struggle for purity and faith) which Mamdani does not address which run counter to his argument. For instance, the period of arab conquest directly following the death of the Prophet Mohammad in the 7th century AD as well as the Mughul conquest of much of the Indian subcontinent in the 16th century AD. Both of these are examples of Jihad-for-Conquest where the idea of a holy war was applied NOT within the context of a political struggle against modernity, communism, or the west. I would have liked to see mamdani address these earlier examples.</span>

                    <span>The blurb on the dust jacket says: "a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world."<P>This is probably true. The book presents a view of the Muslim world that is quite different from others such as Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" which holds that the next big struggles between Muslims and the Christians will be the world's next big battlefield based on cultural differences. Mamdani sees the Muslim's current actions as an extension of the Cold War. (He grew up in Africa, among who's nations the US and the Soviet Union fought the war.) That he is probably right does not alter Huntington's view in my mind.<P>I'd also like to see a chapter, maybe two, on the impact of oil on the crisis. Would 9/11 have happened if Iraq's invasion of Kuwait hadn't happened right over the oil we need to import?<P>I further question some of his historical aspects. Mohammed was both a religious and military leader. (He was pretty good until he came up against one of the Greats - Genghis Kahn.) There seems to be to me more of an emphasis on uniting the two in the current Muslim thinking.<P>I really like his closing statement: "To win the fight against terrorism requires accepting that the world has changed, ... that to occupy foreig places will be expensive, in lives and money. America cannot occupy the world. It has to live in it.</span>
