                <span id="Label1">In <I>Journey through Genius</I>, author William Dunham strikes an extraordinary balance between the historical and technical. He devotes each chapter to a principal result of mathematics, such as the solution of the cubic series and the divergence of the harmonic series. Not only does this book tell the stories of the people behind the math, but it also includes discussions and rigorous proofs of the relevant mathematical results.</span>

                    <span>This book is an important read for a layman trying to get a better grasp on the actual historical building blocks of math. Because Dunham goes through the actual problems and solutions of great mathemeticians the book moves beyond a simple narrative. A deceptively relevant book for anyone trying to understand intellectual history.<P>Its nice to finally see the beauty of what the dullards back in math class were trying to teach us. The reviewers are right that the personalities of some of the mathemeticians do come alive here. But that has been done elsewhere (in more detail as well). <P>The discovery and refinement of mathematics is a central component of civilization, and this is a wonderful way to see its actual historical footings.</span>

                    <span>I studied mathematics in university but never at any great level. I eventually went to law school and I now practice law. I give you this background so that you can appreciate what I know (and don't know about math). When I feel like reading about mathematics I look for a book that can give me a general idea of the math, but that does not get technical (and therfore boring). I also the lives of mathematicians intereting.<P>Dunham's book fits the bill for excellent reading in mathematics. It has just enough meat to it so that I can get insights into various mathematical theories. However he never gets so technical that I fall asleep reading the material.<P>The best parts of the book are the discussions of the various mathematician's and the importance of the mathematical in question. Both form the bulk of the book and are witty and informative. After reading this book, you get the impression that the history of mathematics is filled with a collection of absentminded and colourful men. These parts of the book can be read and enjoyed with absolutely no understanding of the mathematics involved. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get some basic knowledge of mathematics and its history.</span>

                    <span>Absolutely one of the most wonderful books i've ever read !<P>In a chronological way, through each chapter, the book covers the background and history of the current chapter's genius, his great theorem and other achievements, including detailed proofs.<P>William Dunham writing style is perfect :)<BR>Amazon's service is really good also, I live in Israel and I recieved the book in less than one week since ordered...</span>

                    <span>This book talks some of the most intriguing of classical math problems, and I can not tell you enough about how much of a pleasure it is to read.<P>It forces us to put some thought over some of the mathematical results that we take for granted today, such as pythagorean theorum, the infinitude of the prime numbers, etc. I read it in just 2 sittings, and have read it over once again after that. <P>If you have any inclination towards mathematics and its beauty, you will be a different person after you have read through this highly motivating and pleasurable read.<P>The only thing I wished the book had more was the number of problems it covered :) I seriously wish that William Dunham sets out to write many more such books covering many many more such mathematical problems in his beautiful style! Wish you all the best, William!</span>

                    <span>Dunham selects several mathematical theorems and discusses their meaning and their proof. The book is arranged chronologically beginning with Hippocrates (Quadrature of the Lune) and follows with Euclid, Archimedes through Newton, Euler up to modern scientists. If the subject was ONLY mathematics he would have succeeded. But I expected more of a historical perspective and review that the merely cursory one presented here. Still, the book was arranged well with many graphs, formulae, pictures and charts.</span>
