                    <span>The book explains vectors and matrix math very well.
<br />It helps you create a good matrix classes and vector classes. 
<br />
<br />But other than that it does not show how to apply the knowledge to create a 3D engine. It mostly just covers the math, which it does very well. If the scope was only math and not code then I would have given it 5 stars but it says on the front page of the book:
<br />
<br />"Put mathematical theory into practice with working C++ classes....".
<br />
<br />And it does give you an idea of how to do things. It just does not help you tie it all together. But few books cover everything, so its still a very good buy.</span>

                    <span>  This book is a rare find.  Many advanced math texts suffer from unclear prose or use cryptic symbols, but not this one.  What you'll find are clear and well written explanations of each 3d math topic, followed by illustrative pictures and easy to read formulas.  Highly recommended, especially as a starting point for learning 3d math.</span>

                    <span>If you are taking Linear Algebra in college, you know that most of the available textbooks are a little short on practical details and examples of how vectors and matrices will matter to you later on in your programming career. This book provides excellent pictures, diagrams and explanations on the basics of how you can put your Linear Algebra knowlege to work. You don't need to be interested in game development to benefit from the clear and very readable presentation that this book provides. Thank you Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parberry - for the outstanding work.</span>

                    <span>For a long time I wanted to learn 3D programming, but the only options available to teach myself the core mathematics were Appendix A's in Direct3D Programming books or buying three or four Linear Algebra textbooks for college courses and hope that one of them would explain things in terms of 3D and not just "boxes of numbers."
<br />But the 3D Math Primer was exactly what was needed to provide that gap--and even be readable! Just going through the first 11 chapters I was able to create my own spinning cube application that used no 3D libraries whatsoever. =D Previous to this, a dutifully followed Direct3D tutorial had once gotten me a spinning triangle but I can't honestly admit to having any idea what I had done to achieve it.
<br />
<br />There are sections where mathematical topics are presented simply as "interesting things you can do with these boxes of numbers to get whole new boxes of numbers" which hopefully will be given some more 3D filling out in future editions. But I wouldn't recommend waiting as this is already an invaluable resource to anyone who hopes to teach himself 3D programming.</span>

                    <span>This book is very nice.  I have not read it all the way, but it starts with a quick refresher on basics, then starts you learning 2D math and brings it into to 3D math.  It has a lot of equations and math, but also examples of how to code them in c++ also.
<br />
<br />This book is a great choice to get your math up to scratch for programming any 3D graphics/game project.</span>
