                    <span>Thomas Wolf gives a clear and detailed view on the corners and tidbits behind starting a Non-Profit organization.  I STRONGLY recommend this book before you even think of plunking down the money for your own nonprofit or file the 501 c(3).  Too many mistakes can avoided by just reading the basic 101 in this book.  Wolf uses a lot of examples to explain, but make sure you have a dictionary nearby.  If you don't know the ins and outs of the IRS, etc., you need to start here.  Good stuff that is too important to miss, or allow yourself to go bankrupt over.

                    <span>I also use this book as a text for an undergraduate class in non-profit management.  It is an excellent primer on the key issues in the field, particularly those areas that differ from the management of for-profit businesses.  I use Drucker's "Managing the Non-Profit Organization" with this book to add a somewhat higher level overview of the strategic issues and principles in the nonprofit field.</span>

                    <span>This book does provide some wonderful insights and helpful ideas for managing nonprofits. And since I'm always on the lookout for resources to help me do my job better, I'd like to recommend that readers also purchase The Complete Guide to Fundraising Management, Second Edition by Stanley Weinstein. It was just published (by Wiley, I think), and it offers step-by-step guidance in how to manage just about every aspect of fundraising ((major gifts, planned giving, capital campaigns, etc.). It even has a CD-ROM with customizable forms and worksheets that really will help me day-to-day.</span>

                    <span>I use this as the only text for an undergraduate nonprofit management course. It is easy to read and easy to understand, but not simplistic. The book covers the basics and provides enough information to get an overview of the main functions of a nonprofit organization.</span>

                    <span>This is a good book for anyone just getting into non-profit management or just starting to study it.  It would also be a good handbook to keep and refer back to.  The information is fairly basic but is very relevant.  Not for anyone needing more in-depth information or anyone who has already studied the field.  Chapters are divided so that information can be found easily on specific topic areas.</span>
