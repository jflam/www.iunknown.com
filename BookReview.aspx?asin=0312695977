                    <span>The first chapter of the book, "I tried running once and didn't like it", was inspiring. I am 40 years old and new to running; this book helped me learn how to start running and keep running without serious injury. It doesn't tell you that you need to acquire expensive gear to start, just start slow and easy. It tells you when you do need to get good shoes and provides solid advice on what type and how to buy shows. I have hard to fit feet and the book provides useful and detailed information on how to adjust the fit of running shoes. This book does not provide training programs, but instead helps with treating everything from minor aches to major injuries.</span>

                    <span>The most comprehensive book in terms of foot related injuries & pain. Problems are discussed & practical solutions are offered. <BR>Unfortunately, it recommends full sit-ups vs back-friendly crunches & it doesn't sufficiently address iliotibial band syndrome - a very common problem for runners.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book at a race expo many years ago, and it is the most widely used running book I have. It is clearly written and easy to understand. The advice is practical and non technical--and it works! I have lent this book to many of my running buddies who have had aches and pains, and I have used the book a lot myself. In fact, I am ordering a second copy that I can keep for myself since more often than not, when I need it, someone has borrowed it. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who runs.</span>

                    <span>I love this book! Part first aid, part do it yourself podiatry. Learn to diagnose and treat running injuries. Shin splints, stress fractures, they cover it all. Then, learn to diagnose and treat the underlying problems.<P>Everything is clear and practical. Weak arches? Here's how to tape your feet to support them. Need heel cushioning? Use makeup sponges. <P>This is a must for anyone who runs hard. By learning to diagnose and treat yourself, you'll prevent injuries and improve as a runner.<P>--Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu</span>

                    <span>I was first given this book as a gift when I was a teenager, and I found it to be an invaluable reference for understanding the physiology of various injuries as well as what contributed to the injuries. At times, the oft-repeated mantra of "rest, ice, compression, and elevation" gets old, but it really is on the mark.<P>This book belongs in every distance runner's library, together with Coe's Better Training for Distance Runners.</span>
