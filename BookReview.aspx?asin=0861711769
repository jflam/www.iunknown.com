                <span id="Label1">Meditation is like walking toward happiness. And Bhante Henepola Gunaratana is like a tireless bricklayer, constructing a path brick by brick that allows us to make that walk. Without the path, he says, all the walking in the world won't help. Of course, as a Buddhist monk, his blueprint was created long ago in the form of the Buddha's so-called Noble Eightfold Path. In the same clear language that has made his <I>Mindfulness in Plain English</I> a perennial favorite, <I>Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness</I> is his attempt to explain this timeless path of morality, concentration, and wisdom. The gist of the book comes down to the use of the word <i>skillful</i> in the heading of each of the book's chapters. Living well is a skill that takes both practice and understanding. With stories, bulleted summaries, quotes from the sutras, and, most of all, a knack for relating to our everyday concerns, Henepola Gunaratana skillfully teaches us how to refrain from causing others to suffer. This, along with ending our own suffering, leads to happiness.  <I>--Brian Bruya</I></span>

                    <span>I've read lots of books about buddhism, but none as practical and readily understandable as this.  The author writes in plain language and gives many specific tips on enacting each step.  There are no real riddles or obfuscations in the author's approach, and one feels that he's not being stingy or arrogant with his wisdom.  Probably not for more advanced practitioners, but a perfect place to start!</span>

<br />The Buddha's fourth truth is to be cultivated. It is called the nobel eight-fold path. The eight steps are memorized by every person who hears of them and takes up meditation. But memorization is not enough. These steps must be cultivated. How? That is precisely the question Bhante Gunaratana takes up in his book, Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness.
<br />
<br />I recommend this book to experienced meditators, not to beginners. Why? Because it may be too subtle for the neophyte. That's presumptuous I know, but that is how I feel about the work. Bhante G is a very skillful writer. Given the subject could I have chosen a different adjective? His writing is in no way obscure or mysterious, but it is very subtle and a reader may too easily dismiss it.
<br />
<br />That said, this is a wonderful book describing the Buddha's eight-fold path and what the practitioner should consider with each step along it. I highly recommend it for novice to experienced meditators.</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately, a prior reviewer's comments were somewhat unintelligible and punctuated by non sequiturs. It is in stark contrast to the substantive and coherent work by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana. 
<br /> 
<br /> I have long sought a practical and comprehensive manual that could clearly explain and outline, in both detail and simple language, the fine points of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path. Not only has Bhante accomplished this with beautiful clarity, he has done so in a manner that lends itself to easy application within one's daily life. This is not to say that applying the Buddha's doctrine is necessarily a simple process, but merely that (for those interested in Buddhism) reading this book should eliminate any procrastination in commencing the Path because of any possible lack of understanding.
<br /> 
<br /> While the present work was published subsequent to Mindfulness in Plain English - by the same author - it can stand alone quite well. In fact, I would recommend that Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness be read first, before proceeding to Mindfulness in Plain English - as it seems a more natural progression. But, really, this is just a matter of personal preference.
<br /> 
<br /> Anyone purchasing this book with the expectation of gaining a greater understanding of Buddhist doctrine in layman's terms is, in my humble opinion, unlikely to be dissapointed. </span>

                    <span>Unless you are a child, animal or stupid; you are miserable.<br>Ah!  If only we could all be stupid.  This book is about becoming happy even if you are not stupid.  The author<br>guides us along the mythical "yellow brick road" with eight<br>steps.  Skillful understanding, skillful thinking, skillful<br>speech, skillful action, skillful livelihood, skillful effort,<br>skillful mindfulness, and skillful concentration.  These can<br>be played sequentially, and then, at random.  Each one increasing the intensity of the others like music.  One eventually<br>becomes a "happy being."  One of those rare and frightening<br>apparitions.  You know the kind.  People who are happy listening<br>to Barry Manilow.  The "show stopper" is on page 16.  "Observe<br>a potential teacher carefully.  Deeds are more important than<br>words.  Daily contact with who has followed the Buddha's path<br>for at least ten years is a good way to see for yourself whether the teachings work."  Take it from a veteren, the teachings work.<br>But there are a lot of "teacher-morons" out there.  Believe me!<br>They only became teachers because they are in more pain than you and me.  The author is off point here.  And we have to face<br>another issue.  The teachings in this book are distincively<br>Sri Lankan Buddhist.  They will not interface with a good Zen<br>teacher.  I've mentally thrown this book out.  I bought<br>"Mindfulness with Breathing" by Buddhadasa Bhikku.  This is<br>a Thai Buddhist guide to meditation.  And I'm turning myself<br>into the Wai Thai Temple.  The only Buddhist Thai monestery<br>in the United States.  They all have orange robes and shaven heads.  I make up these reviews as I go along.  Don't buy this<br>book unless you have some experience in vipassana.  Buy the author's famed first book, "Minfulness in Plain English."<br>Here you will get the basic nuts and bolts of meditation.<br>Thank you.  And watch where you are driving.  Before buying<br>any book, always ask, "What is the author demanding of me?<br>What will I have to do?"  Thank you.  And be careful out there.<br>I wonder what my religion will be next Wednesday?</span>

                    <span>Bhante Henepola Gunaratana gave some pretty easy advice here for the practitioners on how to make The Noble 8 Fold Path as part of their daily life. The book has some very good instruction, however tends to drag with some worthless knowledge here and there. It's very good for the basic practitioner who needs some understanding on how to make the path part of their lives.</span>
