                    <span>Having read a number of books on Christian Spirituality over the last few years, I can't think of one single book that does as good a job as this book in both introducing a number of significant prayer practices and doing so with such vibrancy and depth. It is obvious that Daniel Wolpert has a feel for this subject that is born of broad and deep experience in both using these practices himself and in helping others enter into these practices in accessible and meaningful ways. Anyone looking for an excellant printed guide of ancient Christian prayer practices made very accessable to present use would do well to start with this book. For folks who already have been learning about and experiencing practices such as the Jesus Prayer, Lectio Divina, the Examen, journaling etc., this book will bring fresh insight, inspiration and integration into your thought and experience around these practices. This book is also an excellant resource for learning about and experiencing these practices in a group setting. Each chapter has excellant step by step concrete ideas for using these practices individually or in a group.</span>

                    <span>This is an exciting book about prayer. Wolpert's writing shows that he practices what he has set to paper.<P>Some older prayer traditions feel understandable and comfortable to use after reading Wolpert's book. Some creative prayer understandings make sense, e.g., the idea of group journaling and praying with nature. I especially like the way Wolpert identifies creativity as prayer. Of course God speaks through creative expression! There's also good news about the body--as in body prayer! Wolpert speaks graceful words to our often negative understandings of the body (or at least how we seem not to measure up to magazine cover standards). <P>This book is rooted in Christ, in the teachings of the Bible, in Christian tradition. It helps us open spiritually to God.</span>
