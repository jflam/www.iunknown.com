                    <span>Other than the fact that the author made a slight narcissistic impression, and the fact he was slightly insensitive to people who do not entirely share his viewpoints, within this book I was pleased to find many unique and enlightening ideas to approach my day and make the best of it, which quickly made me forget everything negative. However, this book is not so much an uplifting book, it assumes you're already motivated enough to change, it just hands you the insightful advice after a lifelong research by the author's quest to make the best of his days. It is neither a specific action book, the author does not spoon feed you, nor hands you his daily schedule. He does however give you an outline of the most important activities of a person's day followed by convincing and logical truths to support his claim. And whether you agree with him is a matter of your opinion, I for one, do (well, mostly).
<br />
<br />Most influential chapters are: attitude, priorities, thinking, commitments, relationships, and values.
<br />
<br />A great companion to this book would be Life's Greatest Lessons: 20 Things That Matter by Hal Urban, it is an inspiring book. If this Today Matters is mostly about effectiveness and growth, Life's Greatest Lessons is about the value and greatness of life. Both are extremely helpful and they would go better together.

                    <span>John Maxwell is a unique author who has been able to make the subject of spirituality acceptable in the study of leadership. His background in the religious world always brings a different perspective into his writings like in his highly successful book The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />In Today Matters, Maxwell again taps into his deep personal philosophies of the essential value of sound decision-making and discipline. This book lists 12 daily practices (he calls them the "Daily Dozen") which can help the reader to build a better life. He believes it is not only important to make good decisions but also to know what decisions to make and this requires a daily agenda. He defines success as, "If you make a few key decisions and manage them well in your daily agenda, you will succeed." His successful philosophy is based on the belief that the right things we do today will give us a better tomorrow. With an optimistic perspective he believes that any given day can become a masterpiece, a term he borrows from former UCLA basketball coach John Wooden. This book is written around what Maxwell believes are the two ingredients of a daily masterpiece... good decisions and daily discipline.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Today Matters is fourteen chapters long and twelve of them focus on the individual practices that should be embraced each day. These include attitude, priorities, health, family, thinking, commitment, finances, faith, relationships, generosity, values and growth. He discusses these twelve practices in detail, and each chapter ends with exercises which can help you to apply them to your life. In the book's conclusion, Maxwell emphasizes that "it's impossible to tackle all twelve at the same time". He provides direction on how to slowly incorporate the "Daily Dozen" and presents a way to rate your present progress. This book is easy to read and Maxwell's many personal stories and famous quotations make it a delight to study.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If you are wondering how you can glean the most out of each day of life and reorient your priorities, Today Matters is just the book you are looking for.

                    <span>I enjoy John Maxwell's books because they are easy to read and uplifting.  This book has some great examples that add credibility to his assertions.  I recommend this book for a light good read.  I also strongly recommend Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self which supplies roadmaps to maximize any situation, master emotions and bring out the best in others.  </span>

                    <span>To be honest it's been a while since Maxwell has written a book worth reading, but this one makes up for his lack of material lately. The 12 practices he discusses are great ideas and the chapter on "Thinking" really got me thinking if you will. Full of great quotes and of course best read in order of the practices you can apply immediately. </span>
