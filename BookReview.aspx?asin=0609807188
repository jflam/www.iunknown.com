                    <span>If there's a book for any young athlete it's this one. Derek is a great example of how a professional athlete should act.  Derek is a great role model for anyone who has a dream about anything.  He shows people that you shouldn't just excel in one area but to be the best at everything you do.  It teaches young adults that "luck" has nothing to do with it but hard work and determination will get you where you want to be and Derek is a great example of that.  If everyone raised their children like Derek's parents this world would be such a better place.  This book also showed great imagery.  I could picture every event that happened in this book.  I don't see anything but inspiration coming out of this book.  It's a great example of how not everyone grows up as a superstar.</span>

DEREK'S TALENT AND HUMBENESS ARE WELL KNOWN AND HIS DEDICATION TO HELPING CHILDREN IS GREAT. THE WORLD NEEDS A ZILLION MORE LIKE HIM. DEREK IS DA MAN, HE HAS TALENT, ALL THE GIRLS HE WANTS, LOOKS AND A GOOD HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS. PARENTS AND TEENS ALIKE SHOULD READ THIS. IN A WORLD OF EGOS AND SELF CENTERED PEOPLE, DEREK SHINES. NUMBER 2, THIS BOOK IS NUMBER 1.</span>

                    <span>The book I have read is called The Life You Imagine by Jack Curry is a great biography.  I recommend this bokk to everyone.  One reason I liked the book is because its about baseball and Derek Jeter plays for my favorite baseball team the New York Yankees.  Another reason I liked this book is its all about Derek Jeters life.  It tells you how and what Jeter went through to make it to the majors.  One minor thing I didn't like about the book is that they talked about Derek Jeter when he was about 8 years old.  The told me about what teams he was on and how he was doing in school at that time.  This book is the next book you should read.</span>
