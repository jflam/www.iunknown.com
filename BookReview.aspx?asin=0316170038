                    <span>John Feinstein's writting never sucks you in to leave you with the "I can't put it down" feeling.  No, his books move slower and more methodically.  
<br />
<br />But in the end his books, this title included, leave the reader with a satisfied feeling.  A feeling that they have gotten an in depth look, with thorough reporting and a sometimes unique perspective, at a sports issue.
<br />
<br />The beauty of "Open" is that this event was widely reported on and covered by the media at the time of the U.S. Open.  But the author's reporting starts us on this jpurney decades earlier and shows us many more reasons why this particular U.S. Open was an historic and dramatic event, aside from the obvious answers that are already known.
<br />
<br />He merges the players on the course with the players behind the scenes who made the event happen.  He shows the history of the financing of the U.S. Open and how that has evolved.  His wrttting is crisp and clear and he sets the scenes in the book nicely with important details about key figures that help the reader appreciate their role in the events even more.
<br />
<br />This book should appeal greatly to the golf fan and have a slightly broader appeal to those who enjoy good reporting from behind the scenes of major news events.  </span>

                    <span>I loved the book.  Absolutely loved it.  But I could see how it wouldn't be for everyone.  If you're a golf geek, you'll love this book.  If you enjoyed A Good Walk Spoiled, you'll love this book.  The story was fascinating.  The people were intriguing.  I didn't think you could write so many pages about one tournament.  Indeed, I was quite skeptical.  But I found myself turning page after page wanting to learn more.  Sure, this book would be extremely boring to someone who had no interest in golf.  But then, I'd find a 300-page book about quilting to be boring.  It's not for everyone.  But if you love to read about golf, you'll love this book.</span>

                    <span>I enjoyed the book, but it certainly occurred to me in the middle of reading it that  a lot of people were going to be ticked off at how misleading the title is in relation to the actual direction of the book.  As has been previously mentioned repeatedly, the book is more -- MUCH more -- about the behind-the-scenes personalities than the US Open golfers themselves.  Feinstein's overall theme is that the US Open is more than a golf tournament, but it's a multi-year planning process with dozens and dozens of vital people playing important roles.  The problem is that he spends a few hundred pages beating this idea over the head of the reader, while the reader wonders when the actual golf is going to start.  You have to sift through a great deal of mini-bios -- and some not so "mini" -- on USGA and state characters before the Open tees off.
<br />
<br />I must say that one of the main reasons I enjoyed the book was because I live 20 minutes from Bethpage Black and drive past the "Bethpage: Home of the 2002 US Open" water tower every day on my way to work -- so the geographical and course info, and other relevant stuff, caught my interest.  Obviously I realize that this same info is meaningless and annoying to people not from the area, something Feinstein should have realized, and if he did, he apparently didnt care.
<br />
<br />There certainly are a bunch of patches where the reader labors through incredibly unnecessary detail, but I thought most of it was made up for with SOME of the behind-the-scenes planning process, as well as the coverage of the Open Qualifiers.  There is a lot of stuff here that is very interesting and entertaining, and you can learn a lot about what goes into putting on an Open.  But if you simply want to read about the 2002 US Open's golf play and analysis, I wouldnt be surprised if you quit after 100-150 pages.  The actual golf coverage takes up maybe the last 20% of the book, and its not all that fulfilling even when you reach it.
<br />
<br />Simply put, the book is way too bogged down in details that have no business being in print.  Outside of the families of said USGA officials, state politicians, etc., I dont know who would be the least bit interested in much of what Feinstein wrote.  However, if you can stomach the rough patches and the misleading title and marketing -- and if things like network TV negotiations, traffic/parking issues, merchandise tent issues, local vs. state politics, etc. can hold your attention and intrigue you in any way --  I think you'll enjoy it.  And you'll probably add a star if you're from the NY Tri-State Area.</span>

                    <span>He writes with a lot of descriptive detail, to a fualt. Every person he mentions gets their biography put in. Way too much extra junk about people no one would ever here of. Chapters start out with the continuing story and quickly break down into the life story of some high ranking account for the PGA, and so on. Read only if you need to get some sleep.</span>

                    <span>John Feinstein finds a lot more interesting things about the preparations for the 2002 U.S. Open than I would. He writes about parking pressures and vendor pilfering the way Cornelius Ryan wrote about D-Day.<p>Those expecting a play-by-play on the golf played during those four days in June, which saw Tiger Woods break away the first day and never look back, may be disappointed. Even when the book's narrative finally reaches the event itself, after some 260 pages, the focus remains on the behind-the-scenes organizers, the USGA, NBC, and state officials. It's a unique situation, Feinstein reminds us, to have used a municipal course to host the U.S. Open, but maybe it's not worth writing a book about.<p>That said, Feinstein's book is an interesting read, especially for those who care about things like event management, sports broadcasting, or professional golf. As an author, Feinstein is much more engaged than he was when he wrote "The Majors," his style coming up to that of his classic "A Good Walk Spoiled."<p>Some of his wit is back in evidence. When a volunteer realizes Tiger used the Porta-John he helped set up, he calls a friend to share the good news. "Yes, Woods thrilled people in many different ways," Feinstein concludes.<p>I also liked the fact he doesn't hold back with the players, something I noticed and minded with "The Majors" after his no-holds-barred approach in "Good Walk Spoiled." Woods still won't shake a TV reporter's hand 18 months after that reporter said Woods was in a "slump." Sergio Garcia has his star moments, while Jeff Maggert comes across as totally unpleasant. At least Feinstein whipping boy John Daly's on his best behavior this time around.<p>The portraits of the organizers and staff that center this book are smoother, and maybe Feinstein finds more of interest about them than you will. It's an interesting tack to take, though, writing not about the game's stars but those who help to make such marquee events happen. Feinstein is in uncharted territory here, and maybe reclaiming some lost ground as golf's most original working writer.<p>That said, "The Open" is still a bore in parts, and lacks a strategic or historical overview of what makes Bethpage's Black Course so special. What did course designer A.W. Tillinghast do with the track that was so unique, and how did it preserve that notoriety over the decades as an overused Long Island muni? There's a splendid tale about golf course architecture waiting to get out here that never quite does.<p>All the same, "The Open" is good for what it is, an appreciation of a very underappreciated aspect of sport. Too bad it isn't a little more interesting, but for those who care (and there are many, given golf's popularity), it will probably be worth your while to check it out.</span>
