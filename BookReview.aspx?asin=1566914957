                <span id="Label1">Wildlife, wilderness, and solitude -- all can be found in Yellowstone National Park, and Don Pitcher's Moon Handbooks Yellowstone-Grand Teton eases travelers' search to find them. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, encompassing Yellowstone and Grand Teton National parks, offers an impressive array of habitats -- from plains and valley, lakes and rivers to high peaks and steaming vents in the Earth. Both parks are flooded with visitors during the summer months, and smart planning is crucial to an enjoyable trip to this magnificent region. Moon Handbooks Yellowstone-Grand Teton offers extensive coverage of accommodations and campgrounds in the parks and in the gateway towns -- including Cody, Jackson, and West Yellowstone; dining and entertainment options; best bets for recreational opportunities, hiking, backcountry camping, fishing, winter sports, and much more. Author Don Pitcher's coverage of the geological, flora, fauna, and human histories of the region -- from Native inhabitants and the mountain men to the politician's who created the parks -- provide a detailed back-story to this most treasured piece of American soil. Comprehensive, insightful, and resourceful, Moon Handbooks Yellowstone-Grand Teton is a must-have for any vacation planning.</span>

                    <span>Author Don Pitcher has revised the wonderful first edition of his Moon Handbook for Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. The new edition packs in even more information than the original. This guide contains detailed driving information for driving through both Yellowstone and Grand Teton Parks. The guide also provides helpful tips on highlights in both parks and the areas where you are most likely to see wildlife. The hotel reviews and contact information have been updated, and I found the reviews to be quite accurate. <P>One of the best features of this book is the information included on Jackson, Wyoming, including a detailed block-by-block map of the city which shows the location of each restaurant, museum, art gallery, and store mentioned in the text.<P>I like the Moon Handbook series because of the extensive historical information included in each book. This one is no exception. Using this book will give you a much greater appreciation of the area's fur trappers, early traders, and American Indian influences in addition to the natural beauty of the area.</span>

                    <span>This book was very imformative and valuable on a recent road trip to the parks with my kids. I provided a consise resource of information and facts in an easily readable form. A valuable addition to your glove box at the start of your trip, or reading material on the flight to Jackson. Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>There are many travel guides which will tell you where to eat, where to stay, and how much you can expect to spend. Some contain maps, important phone numbers, and local attractions. This book goes well beyond that. You will come away with a deep appreciation of the area and a better understanding of the wildlife. You will come to understand the differences between a black, brown, and grizzly bear and how to peacefully coexist with them in the park. You will learn how geysers work, what dangers exist, and how to help preserve the park for future generations.</span>

                    <span>I just returned from a visit to Yellowstone and found this book extremely helpful both in planning the trip and as a reference while there. I particularly liked the author's reviews of the accomodations within the park, which I found to be accurate, especially his reviews of the accomodations at the Old Faithful area, Canyon, and Lake Yellowstone.<P>The book contains excellent, accurate maps and the descriptions of touring the park contain lots of little-known sites that were worth seeing. Also, the book contains great information on hikes within the park.<P>I looked at several other guides to Yellowstone, this one by far outshines the other ones that I saw.<P>Enjoy your visit to this wonderful park!</span>

                    <span>I just came back from vacation in Jackson Hole, and this book was like a bible for our trip. Not only was it small enough not to be cumbersome in my bag, but it was so indepth as to be excessive -- just like I like travel books to be. It is replete with local history, shopping and accomodations tips, geology, and so much more. My girlfriend's mom, a Jackson native who prides herself on her knowledge of the area and its wildlife, fell so in love with it I gave it to her. The only minor issue I had with the book was that he didn't include much discussion on birdlife (big deal, right?). If you're going to travel the whole state, please buy Pitcher's book on all of Wyoming. Incidentally, I am a very big fan of Lonely Planet guides, but there didn't appear to be a good one for Wyoming or this area.</span>
