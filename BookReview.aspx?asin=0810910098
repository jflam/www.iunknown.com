                <span id="Label1">Here is an exotic interior-design book for anyone who has ever dreamed  of escaping to a different way of life. The elegant lifestyle, magnificent homes, and  varied furniture and decor of the French, Dutch, Spanish, English, and Danish islands of  the Caribbean from the late 18th century to the early 20th century are revealed as never  before in this sumptuous volume.<P>With some of the most beautiful tropical islands on earth as a backdrop, dazzling  photographs reveal the homes of the sugar barons who made their fortunes there. Tables  and beds from St. Thomas and Ste. Croix, armoires and chairs from Martinique,  cupboards and chests from the Spanish Antilles, settees and cabinets from the English  islands; all are works that combine the grace and opulence of European and North  American styles with the vernacular island forms and decorative motifs. These gorgeous  examples give the reader a unique view of the casual refinement of aristocratic Caribbean  living.</span>

                    <span>Reading this book is like being invited to an elegant house party in the Caribbean. You then enter a world of magical realism, in which you sit in the veranda of an 18th century "Great House" with beautiful ocean views, and your pick of antique "planters' chairs," with cool drinks waiting on a "cupping table." You listen to tales of planters and merchants, of sugar cane fields and slaves turned artisans. The material culture of the Caribbean is presented here, seen through the lens of historical events, the experiences of the wealthy and those who served them. You learn wonderful details about the subtle differences of styles on the Spanish, Dutch, English, French and Danish islands. The photographs are beautiful and range from vistas to architecture to furniture and their details. It is also a very scholarly work, of interest to anyone who loves antiques, craftsmanship, history and the Caribbean.<BR> This book is truly an experience you can come back to again and again, and discover something new (or old...).</span>
