                    <span>Well I was not of the 60's generation, that was my parents. But after reading this book, I found out a lot more of what the hippies were about and the whole "movement" that they went through in order to turn "beatniks" and "bohos" into the fun loving hippies that Kesey and the Merry Pranksters were. The book entails of the first mission of making the first acid based movie in order to show the people of San Francisco a movie to enjoy to get an LSD experience, even if your not on LSD. Their mission turned into much more than that when they discover that they can change the way people think..."Control". They develop more and more of a following, holding conventions and festivals in order to celebrate the acid tests that they were performing on their followers. Soon they have Hell's Angels by their side, The Grateful Dead to groove to, and the cops to evade and play games with. I have to admit, the book was rather difficult to understand at some parts due to my lack of knowledge of the times and the lack of knowledge of some of the important people of the era who contributed to the hippie movement. Before I read this book, Ken Kesey was just the man who wrote "One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest", but after reading the book I saw that he played a much more important role to the 60's and many people who followed his movement.</span>

                    <span>What do Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, Timothy Leary and the Hells Angels have to do with the San Francisco Hippie scene of the sixties? 
<br />
<br />How did LSD become so popular during that decade? Who is Ken Kesey and why did he form a group known as the Merry Pranksters? What is Day-Glo? What is a contact high? 
<br />
<br />Find out about a bus dubbed "Furthur" and it's beat generation driver, Neal Cassady. Neal's legendary driving skills are acclaimed by Tom Wolfe, our gonzo reporter and tour guide. 
<br />
<br />The Pranksters go cross-country by bus to visit Timothy Leary. They strive to convert beat generation wisdom into a new hip generation -- the hippies. 
<br />
<br />Ken Kesey, author of "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" develops an "Acid Test" and preaches his own gospel to America's young. The Grateful Dead hang with the Pranksters, and develop their craft.  Acid rock is born.

                    <span>is a great description of this one.  Although never having more than just mild high school experimention with illicit substances and never having done hallucinagenics, Wolfe does, I assume, an excellent job of making you feel as if you were there and partaking.  I suppose "On the Road", "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test", "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and then "Less Than Zero" is the natural progression of the drug phenomenon(although there has to be better than "On the Road" as the starting point).  I dont know why, but I am fascinated with these type of books.  Although not as outrageous as Fear, this is a close second.</span>

<br />While many people may not approve of the topic of this book, it carries a cross-generational message which we would be well advised not to ignore. Aging baby-boomers with problem children would do well to pick up a copy of The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test as a poignant reminder of our own generation's quirks and foibles. Generation `X' ers might learn that they didn't first invent new ways of tormenting their parents. 
<br />
<br />The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test charts the strange odyssey of author Ken Kesey (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) and his band of Merry Pranksters as they metamorphosed from Beatniks to Hippies. Tom Wolfe's masterpiece offers a detached view of the alternate lifestyles, experiments with drugs, sex and the world view offered by the counter-culture of the 60's. He doesn't necessarily approve of everything they did, but he does try to offer an objective recounting of some events that had a major impact on American life for all time. 
<br />
<br />Wolfe recounts how Kesey met a freak/genius chemist with the rather improbable name of Augustus Owsley Stanley III, who lent his middle name to one of the more potent types of LSD which was in circulation in California in the days before it became illegal. Owsley purchased a bulk quantity of Lysergic Acid Monohydrate from a chemical warehouse, using the fictitious name "The Beyer Research Group". He turned this into over 1 million doses of the infamous "Blue Owsley" - an oval tablet with a picture of Batman stamped on the side of it. 
<br />
<br />Much of the proceeds from this venture were used to fund and equip a band called The Warlocks, which would become better known as "The Grateful Dead". Kesey also managed a rather dubious accomplishment by turning the Hell's Angels on to Acid. I'm not sure what he was trying to do by welcoming self-proclaimed social outcasts with open arms, but he pulled it off without anyone getting beaten or killed. 
<br />
<br />Purchasing an old International school bus for $1500, Kesey and company set off on the first of many bizarre cross-country trips. Perhaps the strangest confrontation came when the Pranksters dropped in uninvited and unannounced at the Millbrook, NY compound of drug guru Timothy Leary. Never was there such a culture clash as the meeting of the two self-appointed High Priests of High. Leary and his group were into somber meditation and trying to unlock the secrets of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Kesey and his band were simply out to have a raucous good time, and they thought that Leary and his followers took this whole thing altogether too seriously. 
<br />
<br />Criss-crossing the country from 1964 through 1967, Kesey and company most certainly raised a few eyebrows with their bus painted in every imaginable color. While some would prefer to believe that they were also raising the level of conciousness among the young people of America at the time, the truth is that many people never heard of this legend until well after the fact. 
<br />
<br />The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test holds a mirror up to our past which reflects a great deal of cultural change which has transformed our society, in both good ways and bad. Those who didn't grow up or come of age in this period of time will have a difficult time understanding the viewpoint and mores of Middle America in the middle of the 1960s. Those who did may cast a sheepish look back at ourselves and ruefully reflect on how we ourselves have changed, and in ways we never anticipated. But try it for yourself! Pick up a copy. Another book I need to recommend -- very much on my mind since I purchased a "used" copy off Amazon is "The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition" by Richard Perez, an exceptional, highly entertaining, somewhat subversive little novel I can't stop thinking about.

                    <span>If you're interested in the nonpolitical side of the '60s counterculture, this is a great insider's account.  Wolfe's warped, exuberant sense of style does a masterful job of recreating the wild, iconclastic feel of the time.  Reading this book really gives you a feel of what it must have been like to live with Kesey and the Merry Pranksters.  After a while, you feel like one of them, totally swept up by the heady mix of intellectualism, creativity, rebellion, and drugs.  While this insider's view is the book's best attribute, it also hurts it.  Wolfe's report of the times is half way between imitation beat literature and journalism.  While he succeeds on the first front, his account is too biased to possibly be considered journalism.  He ignores what could reasonably be seen as Kesey's dark side (introducing teenage runaways to powerful drugs and then initiating relationships with them).  I found myself reading Helter Skelter (about the Charles Manson case) immediately after The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test in order to get both sides of the 60's communal living coin.  Also, Wolfe knows his social history pretty well, but he should leave the music history to somebody else.  He essentially calls The Beatles a rip off of The Grateful Dead, which is just laughable.  Yes, the Beatles appropriated elements of psychedelia on their later albums, but they still sounded nothing like the Grateful Dead.  Also, calling The Beatles' late 60's albums "acid rock" is simply wrong.  "Rubber Soul" was above all else a folk-rock album and "Sgt. Peppers" and "Magic Mystery Tour" were psychedelic pop, and had little to do with the heavier, druggier sounds of acid rock.  Wolfe also repeatedly overstates the importance of The Grateful Dead.  Because of their association with Kesey, Wolfe claims that they single handedly pioneered psychedelic rock.  Obviously, the writer has never heard of a little band from Texas known as The Thirteenth Floor Elevators....         </span>
