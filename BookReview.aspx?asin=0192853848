                    <span>Part of a series by Oxford University Press, this book, 'Theology: A Very Short Introduction', by David Ford, Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, follows the same format as other texts in the Very Short Introduction series -- it has fewer than 200 pages, is well indexed, has a useful listing of further readings, accessible and enjoyable narrative, and captures the essence in a very short space the major points of its topic. There are probably nearing 100 volumes in this Very Short Introduction series (making it, ironically, not a Very Short series), but among those that I have read, this text stands out as being one of the more interesting to me. <p>There are ten chapters grouped according to three major sections:  Describing the Field of Theology; Theological Explorations; and Skills, Disciplines and Methods.  In the first section, Ford sets the stage by looking at the state of religious and academic institutions generally, before proceeding on to looking at the particular disciplines of religious studies and theology, which contrary to much popular thinking, are not the same thing at all.  Ford looks specifically at postmodernism, Karl Rahner, Hans Frei's five types of theology, and general philosophical ideas at play in theological study.<p>In the section on Theological Explorations, for most this is where the heart of the matter lies.  Various key components of systematic theological thinking are explored - the doctrine of God, the idea of ethics and morality (particularly as it has to do with worship and God), the problem of evil, basic Christological issues, and the idea of salvation.  Ford does not confine his text to one particular view, but gives a sampling of different ideas, and highlights difficulties and strengths of each view.<p>The final primary section is one that often comes first in many theology texts of this sort - a discourse on method (with apologies to Descartes).  Ford looks a bit at the history of the theological enterprise and how others have `done' theology in the past.  He then looks at key tools such as experience, knowledge and wisdom as shapers of theology.  tools such as experience, knowledge and wisdom as shapers of theology.  He uses Lonergan's three-level description method for epistemology as an example, and then turns to a nine-fold approach to appropriate knowing of God.  <p>The last chapter looks at issues continuing for theology into the third millennium.  Theology as a Christian enterprise is 2000 years old, and shows no signs of slowing, although theology in the future will be a very different creature and construct from theology in the past, all the while it must acknowledge its grounding in the events and the methods of the past.  <p>Like other books in this Very Short series, there are some useful illustrations and suggestions for further reading, should the Very Short introduction not prove sufficient (and for many, this sample will leave the reader wanting more). I cannot speak too highly of this series.</span>

                    <span>Although I have a Master of Divinity degree from a seminary and have been reading theology off and on for thirty years, I have seldom enjoyed a work as much as this short but fascinating introduction to the field. Every word is worhy of thought. For Ford, theology has to do with "overwhelmings" in life. Human beings can be overwhelmed by most any concern: money, sex, race, nation, fitness, youth, etc. But theolgy has to do with being overwhelmed by God. Using that approach, Ford then shows how Christian theology has talked about the Christian God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) in the face of overwhelings in history. He shows how people like Barth and Tillich differ in their systems, but does so in a way that is really clear and helpful. He gives the classic response to evil, but in a way that does not take away the mystery of evil nor belittles the pain of human life. Within his discussion of evil, which he terms the dark mystery, he offers readers the mystery of goodness, the mystery of light. Both belong to any thoughtful discussion of life, and both come to focus in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus. I for one will now read other works by Ford and will look for other titles in this excellent series of Very Short Introductions to interesting subjects. This is a book to buy, to return to, and to offer friends. Even people who never thought they would be interested in theolgy will find themselves responding to the questions Ford asks.</span>
