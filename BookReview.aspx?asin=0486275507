                    <span>These early poems of Frost ( 1916) already display his characteristically clear and cold lines, his fine delineations of Nature, his moral meanings. "Two roads diverged in a wood- and I / I took the one less traveled by/ and that has made all the difference.
<br />Frost was a tremendously ambitious and hardworking poet, who some biographers have accused of sacrificing life and family to art. His poetry has a stark beauty about it, the beauty of the birches he devotes a major poem to. 
<br />This collection lacks many of his major poems , but nonetheless gives the feeling and flavor truly of a major American poet.

                    <span>These poems seem firmly rooted in New England and seem to be timeless, though decidedly pre-modern feel to them (this was originally published in 1916).  Some of these poems may seem familiar ... "The road not taken" is popular at high school graduations.    There are poems of nature such as The Oven Bird ("There is a singer everyone has heard,/ Load, a mid-summer and mid-wood bird,") or "Birches ("and they seem not to break; though once they are bowed/ for low for long, they never right themselves") but with wider significance.  There are also poems of rural isolation such as "The Hill Wife" and "Snow".  His poetry plays by literary and poetic rules, and may not be simple to read, but he does not oversimplify life.</span>

                    <span>This collection is actually not bad.  It provides some of Frost's best poems in an easy to carry book, and for a buck you can't go wrong.  This is great for first time Frost readers, but not for the experienced Frost fan.  I love Frost and carry this book and plenty other Dover poetry books in my laptop case wherever I go!</span>

                    <span>I was looking forward to reading 'Stopping By the Woods on a Snowy Evening', but came away disappointed. Of course, 'The Road Not Taken' is worth the price of admission regardless. It is chock-full - as chock-full as 53 pages can possibly be - of other Frost goodies.<p>Overall, a good book for the price and a great addition to your order, but for serious Frost devotees I would suggest a more comprehensive collection.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Frost, like no other poet, captures a moment that we all have experienced at one time in life.  He paints a picture with such vivid strokes of literary imagery that the mind brings the reader back to a moment in time, almost feeling the sensations of past experiences.<p>For example, I recently made a decision where I was torn between family and career interests.  To ease the anxiety of a lost professional opportunity, I reasoned that the chance would present itself again someday, maybe.  Thinking of Frost I realized that he captured that very self-rationalization in the Road Not Taken.  "Oh, I kept the first for another day!  Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back."  <p>As others have pointed out already, the largest drawback of the book is lack of thickness.  Even though one of my all-time favorites, "Stopping By the Woods on a Snowy Evening," is not present, others like "An Old Man's Winter Night" make up for it.  If you need a small book to stick in a backpack while hiking for moments of inspiration while on the trail, you could do worse than to carry along a little bit of Frost.</span>
