                <span id="Label1">Many designers have "pop-up menu" envy over all the sleek variations that can be found on the Web. Al Sparber and the crew at Projectseven.com are well known for their tutorials and Dreamweaver extensions that help designers create state-of-the-art effects. This book shares some of their work, particularly the latest in cool menu designs.<p>  It's like a gift-bag of Project Seven's best offerings with step-by-step tutorials detailing how things work. For example, the authors show how to use cascading style sheets (CSS) and cookies to make user-controlled visual themes, how to build Dynamic HTML (DHTML) drop-down and fly-out menus, and even how to make menus that collapse and expand or have a tree functionality similar to that found on Windows or Mac operating systems. These aren't just eye-candy tricks either; they're also the sorts of interfaces that Web site visitors will intuitively understand. Other practical lessons show readers how to save bandwidth by using CSS to make an imageless navigation system or how to make a clickable DHTML tabbed interface. Also, the authors do not neglect compatibility issues. The book's not about showing off--these are practical methods that also give a site a fresh look.<p>  The project files are all included on the CD-ROM, along with finished results. The real deal is found in the custom Dreamweaver extensions, creating with just a click content that would otherwise require a lot of valuable time to write in JavaScript.<p>  Although readers should have experience with Dreamweaver, the book is written in a clear manner that outlines carefully what will be accomplished at each stage and why you might want to carry out any given task in a certain way. Since the tutorials all rely on the custom extensions, readers do have to follow along faithfully. In essence, this is a cookbook-style manual, using some prepackaged ingredients, and with each recipe producing the desired meal. Each chapter ends by explaining how readers can modify the results with their own design flavorings. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I> </span>

                    <span>This book is a scam. The formula for making money these days: steal other people's material, repackage it with a glossy paperback cover, dupe new and young web page designers into buying it. I left my own copy in the stall at an airport a couple of months ago, and I'm sorry I forgot to flush. My advice? You can do better with your hard earned $29, just take more time browsing the Macromedia Dreamweaver shelf at your book store.</span>

                    <span>The Review dated July 15th 2004 by anonymous "reader" is obviously written by a person who has not read the book. The nature of the attack: "Mr. Sparber is apparently too busy inflating his own macromedia dev. exchange ratings to dedicate quality time to authoring useful material..." is likely the work of one of several obscure Macromedia Extension authors, who were discovered to be manipulating the ratings of Sparber's Dreamweaver extensions on the Macromedia Exchange in an effort to advance their own ratings. Sparber, along with Macromedia, discovered the manipulation and Macromedia banned the perpetrators from the Exchange. Apparently one of them is expressing his ill will.</span>

                    <span>Unfortunately, I found this book just a rehash of other author's original concepts. Mr. Sparber is apparently too busy inflating  his own macromedia dev. exchange ratings to dedicate quality time to authoring useful material. Besides unintelligible grammar and poor editing, this publication offers nothing new and exciting. Pass.</span>

                    <span>I can?t understand why so many people are so mad about this book. It?s not really about learning Dreamweaver, it is about the extensions that are on the CD and how to use them. Nothing more nothing less. The extensions are good, all right, but you can get many great extensions for free legally on the net, even at the official Macromedia homepage. And more often than not these extensions are so easy to use that you don?t really need to spend a lot of bucks for a book that tells you how to use them inside Dreamweaver. All the extensions are about Javascript, so if you don?t want to force your websites` users to have Javascript enabled on their browsers then this book isn?t for you.<br>Four stars anyway for the nice choice of extensions, which keeps you from spending hours on the net to find the extensions you need and because without a book like this one many people might not be aware of the power and ease of Dreamweaver extensions.</span>

                    <span>This is the best "Magic" book ever written, period. Despite the fact that it was written for Dreamweaver 4, users of MX will still find the projects completely workable & engaging. The attention to detail and easy to follow instructions sets this book apart from all others. These projects are COOL and they really work! Better yet, they can be easily adapted to use in many real world scenarios. Al Sparber and the rest of the DW 4 Magic team should be extremely proud of their work on this one. I only wish they'd had 50 projects instead of 13. Buy it!!</span>
