                <span id="Label1"><b>What is this book about?</b>    <p>    If you've installed Linux, or have access to a version of UNIX, you've probably gotten used to the environment and its configuration, but if you want to start programming, most Linux books leave you on your own. This book takes off where they stop, showing you how to make the most of the tools UNIX offers (which are included as standard with any distribution of Linux) and start programming UNIX for real.<br>    <br>    <i>Beginning Linux Programming, 2nd Edition</i>, concentrates on C programming, looking at the GNU tools, and the UNIX C libraries, to teach you step by step how to write, build, and debug serious application code. Throughout the book, you develop a fully featured CD Database application, allowing you to see the theory of each new topic applied to a real application. As well as handling basic file operations, input and output and dealing with the way UNIX handles data, you discover such advanced topics as inter-process communication, networking, and using CGI scripting to build a Web interface&#160;&#8212;&#160;all the elements of client-server programming. You are also introduced the GTK+ and you find out how to build rich graphical user interfaces for X with GNOME. Finally, there's an introduction to device drivers, to give you a window into the way the Linux kernel itself works.<br>    <br>    You'll also learn shell scripting for BASH, as well as two more powerful scripting languages&#160;&#8212;&#160;Tcl and Perl.    <p>    <b>What does this book cover?</b>     <ul>     <li>The Perl language     <li>Programmming for GNOME(TM)     <li>POSIX(r) threads     <li>Kernel(r) programming     <li>Latest Linux kernel, current tools and C libraries     </ul>    <p>    <b>Who is this book for?</b>    <p>    You need to be comfortable with the basics of using Linux, with a good working knowledge of how to use and configure your system. You should also know some simple C. If you're familiar with basic programming concepts, the working examples in the book will soon give you the confidence to explore Linux's C libraries.<br>    <br>    You'll find the programming tools used in this book are included with virtually any Linux distribution, so this book is all you need to get started as a Linux programmer.     </span>

                    <span>If you are a sysadmin or want to learn programming on UNIX/LINUX you must have this book.  I have several books on C and several on other languages I would trade them all for this.  It covers the basics (essentials) that other books written exclusively for one language don't even touch on.  I explains how all of the languages covered interplay with UNIX/LINUX.  <p>The first chapter covers programs, the C compiler, header files, staic libraries, and shared libraries.  It explains they all come together to make a program in a way that it can be understood<p>The second chapter covers UNIX shell scripts at length.  I have good book on shell scripts, and this chapter alone is just as good as that book.  <p>The third chapter covers working with UNIX files, system calls, library functions etc...  The sample programs all work as they are supposed to.  Everything is clearly explained and easily understood.  <p>The 4th chapter covers passing arguments to C programs, envorment variables, temporary files, configuring logs, and system resources.  <p>I have not read any further, because I've only had this book a week.  I've been looking for a book like this for a few years.  It talks about how C and other languages interface with LINUX/UNIX rather than just giving you the pure language and leaving you to fend for yourself.  <p>Other chapters include:<br>5) Terminals<br>6) Curses<br>7) Data Management<br>8) Development Tools<br>9) Debugging<br>10) Processes and Signals<br>11) POSIX Threads<p>12) Inter-process Communication: Pipes<br>13) Semaphores, Mesage Queues, and Shared Memory,<br>14) Socets<br>15) TCL: Tool Command Language<br>16) Programming for X<br>17) Programming for GNOME using GTK+<br>18) The Perl Programming Language<br>19) Programming for the Internet: HTML<br>20) Internet Programming 2: CGI<br>21) Device Drivers<br>Appendex A) Portability<br>Appendex B) FSF and the GNU Project<br>Appendex C) Internet Resources<br>Appendex D) Bibliography<p>If you are only get one book on programming, this is the one you need.  I have at least 8 other books on various programming languages, and this one is better than all of them combined.  This book is 900 pages packed full information, and it's easily understood.  The sample programs all work and are well documented.<p>I write this review after reading only four chapters, because the information I have gotten out of them is worth way more than the price of this book.  This book gives you all the pieces to the puzzles and tells you how to put it together.  This book can be used by advanced programmers as well to fill in any knowlege gaps they may have.  This book gets my highest recommendation, as it will be by my side for years to come.</span>

                    <span>This is a big book that covers a lot of topics relating to Linux.  If you're looking for a introductory book or a somewhat intermediate book that will help you get a jump on Linux programming then this is probably the best one released for this operating system so far.  Although you'll find many typos and misaligned text in this book, as well as some dated code and libraries, it still does provide a lot of useful examples into how Linux programs are written and created.  Most of the things covered in this book are done rather quickly so it is not a complete reference manual at all and it doesn't aim to be.  It is more or less just a large book on many key Linux subjects and you will not be wasting your time picking up a copy of this book.  Hopefully we'll see more books like this one released for this operating system.</span>

                    <span>I won't waste your time here - suffice to say that if you need to get into Unix/Linux programming fast (as I did for a computer science course), get this book quickly.  In too many programming books, the authors just seem to want to show off their knowledge.  In this book, you really will learn something, as it was written for the student.  <br>Just buy it, already.</span>
