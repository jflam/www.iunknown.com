                    <span>You have got to be kidding. The examples are complex, not well explained, and basically the context is disjointed with no transition between subjects or chapter contents. This cannot be an introduction to Remoting, and is definitely not an intermediate introduction either. That leaves EXPERIENCED NET REMOTING Developers. Note I mentioned both "EXPERIENCED", "NET" and "REMOTING", though I doubt there would be use for those folks either. Cannot explain why this book would get ONE positive comment. I have yet to try the examples, but the way each example is explained is bizarre and confusing.</span>

                    <span>By now I have read numerous books on .NET remoting.  ".NET Remoting" by McLean, Naftel and Williams is by far the best.  What I like most about it is the writing style; it is clear and concise.  What's more, the writing is grammatical and at times best described as elegant.  Kudos to the authors.  In my opinion, this book is a "must have".</span>

                    <span>Having an accompanying CD speaks for itself if you are looking for examples that work. This books examples are not sufficiently detailed to get working. The jobserver example of server-activated object alludes to an approach that will never work but authors get away scot-free because they have no CD. The example suggests that a server activated remote object can expose an interface that contains an event and that clients can add (+=) their own handlers to this event. Maybe they did not mean to suggests that but I think most will agree that it sure looks like it.<p>The book looks great and is well organized until you start trying to implement the examples.<p>Much changed with remoting going from 1.0 to 1.1 and the degree of change comes close to making this book obsolete, though I have seen taht there is a 1.1 book out.<p>If the level of detail in a technical books examples is insufficient or if examples are incorrect then there is a real integrity issue if authors have not:<br>1. gotten code to work themselves<br>2. put working examples on CD or on a web site<br>3. put themselves on the line by fielding questions regarding the examples<p>I work with some really bright people with deep and wide experience with .Net Framework since early beta 1 and they all agree that some of the things the examples suggest are impossible and will not work.</span>

                    <span>As owner of some 20 MS Press books, I'd like to congratulate the authors on doing a particularly good job with this one.<p>The only exposure I had previously to the Remoting part of the Framework was the little resource I could find on-line at MSDN [either way too over-the-head for a first timer, or pretty useless] and a few "tutorials" which, on the whole, had been pieced together by people who knew only a little more than me.<p>Having said that, it would suit someone who has some experience in Remoting, too.<p>I agree with a previous reviewer that it does fall into the trap, as a lot of technical books do, of displaying a code snippet, half of which is 100% in context with accompanying text and the other half of which is approximately 0% in context - only making sense once you've read a few more pages.<p>Will serve as an excellent reference book in months to come!</span>
