                    <span>I like this book very much because it explains different concepts and terminology in simple terms -- good for people who are trying to learn photography but not knowing much yet (like me). There are a lot of pictures in the book, so it isn't boring at all. 
<br />
<br />It also explains traditional photography very well, including cameras, darkroom etc. However, don't expect much from the technology section of the book since it is quite outdated, however it does give you a brief background with the technology though. (It's only a minor problem... anyway)
<br />
<br />Recommended to those who are interested in photography.... also get Book 1 as well.</span>

                    <span>This is a beautifully printed curiosity / collector's item.  
<br />
<br />Contrary to the book's title you won't find much useful information about photography in this book.  Most of its pages are devoted to arcane and obscure film print development techniques.  While many of these techniques are interesting and can produce fascinating results, let's face it; do you really want a book that teaches you how to print a black and white film photo with pasta sauce and Epsom salts?!  If so, this is the book for you!
<br />
<br />The rearmost 1/4 of the book is cursorily devoted to digital image processing.  Note that this book dates back to 1998, absolutely ancient by digital standards.  So although the basic concepts presented are good the changes to the digital scene have rendered the digital material basically useless.  Which is probably fine with the author (note that that's NOT Ansel Adams), as I could almost hear him hissing as he wrote that section of the book.
<br />
<br />I bought this book at a bookstore (what's that?) and it was shrink-wrapped in plastic.  So all that i could learn about it was in the blurbs on the cover...which are very misleading.</span>

                    <span>Schaefer has taken on a major task in reworking the material to reflect changes in equipment and materials while maintaining the thoroughness, attention to detail, and spirit of the Adams' series. I feel that he has  succeeded nicely. <p>While a lot has been borrowed directly from the  previous work there is also much new material and the format itself has  been changed substantially. The book now opens with a thoroughly enjoyable,  albeit brief, history of photography before getting down to  business...Although targeted at a bit different readership than its  predecessor, An Ansel Adams Guide: Basic Techniques of Photography, Book I  is a good read and destined to become as much a classic as the original.</span>
