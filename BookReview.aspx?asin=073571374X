                <span id="Label1">There's no question that Adobe's Creative Suite includes many new, "must have" features and it's no wonder that Haynes and Crumpler begin this latest addition to the excellent Photoshop Artistry series with an excited testimony to converting to Mac OS X in order to take advantage of these new goodies. Among the new topics covered in this book: the Camera Raw filter (which processes the Raw data from your digital camera, giving greater detail), support for16-bit mode, the new Layer Comp palette, Shadow/Highlight adjustment, and Color Match tool, improved templates for web galleries and contact sheets, and using the Epson print dialog boxes in the OS X environment.<p>  This series is aimed at professionals who work with digital photographs and graphics, especially those with significant experience in both traditional photography and using Photoshop. The book is set up the same as in earlier editions and with some of the same exercises, now updated to reflect the changes in CS. After an opening section on basics like tools, palettes, actions, and layers, the book discusses more advanced topics in digital imaging, like applying the Zone System, made popular by Ansel Adams, to Photoshop and mastering calibration, color spaces, scanning, resolutions, and histograms (using the new dynamic histogram palette). In hands-on tutorials, readers learn how to use layers and adjustment layers; selections, channels, and layers for compositing; histograms, levels, curves, and Hue/Saturation for color correction; advanced techniques for correcting a bad scan; how to turn yellow flowers orange with Color Range, Replace Color, and Selective Color tools or turn a red car green with Color Match; how to work with duotones; techniques in retouching and restoring; how to combine bracketed captures to increase dynamic range; and much more.<p>  Throughout, the book features text-heavy explanations accompanied by lots of illustrations and screenshots. It's the sort of image-laden book where you can learn so much just by reading the sidebars. An extensive index makes it ideal for troubleshooting. The sample photographs included on the CD-ROM are excellent quality and well chosen to match situations that occur in professional jobs. This book is rich in information. If you're a professional photographer or Photoshop power-user, this book and Adobe Photoshop CS are now essential to your studio. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I></span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I continue to find myself disappointed with this "Artistry" version. I read Photoshop 6 Artistry cover to cover and found it very good. All the praise of the other reviews was certainly deserved. I upgraded to CS and felt compelled to buy the new version of "Artistry" primarily to learn about the new features, especially since the Adobe documentation is a bit cryptic in places. 
<br />
<br />I must say, I'm disappointed. It's feels like this version was rushed to press. The new features are mentioned but not explained very well at all. In many cases, the explanations are nothing more than a rehash of the Adobe documentation. 
<br />
<br />For example, the camera raw section doesn't really give much insight into what you are trying to accomplish through the use of the feature (some, but not much). Nor does it give a very good description of the recommended workflow within the feature or how to incorporate it into your overall workflow. Further, there are no hands-on examples. 
<br />
<br />The Shadow/Highlight section is similarly lacking. The authors seem to allude to the fact that this may be more of a "simple tool" rather than one for the serious user. But they don't really come right out and say that. If so, tell us. If not, tell us how to incorporate it into the workflow, especially since it isn't available as an adjustment layer. 
<br />
<br />The section on the color replacement tool is as obscure as Adobe's. I still can't figure this tool out very well. The descriptions for sampling and limits are extremely confusing. This is a case where the book could have cleared up the mysteries that remain after reading the Adobe documentation several times.
<br />
<br />I still think this series is very good and I have learned a great deal from it. I would still recommend it to anyone wanting an in depth understanding of Photoshop. I am simply disappointed that the authors appear to have taken shortcuts with the new features in CS and don't seem to have carried through with the same quality of the previous editions.</span>

                    <span>As a total beginner, I learned Photoshop using the 5.5 version of this book and have bought the corresponding version each time I have upgraded.  This book is great for not only intermediate and advanced users but also for beginners who want to understand why and how the program works in depth from the start and don't mind investing the effort to do so.
<br />
<br />If you are looking for a quick reference or "Photoshop basics in 3 hours" DON'T buy this book!  You will be better served by something else;  BUT, if you are looking to really learn the program and willing to invest the time, your efforts will be richly rewarded using this book.  I can't say enough for it.  
<br />
<br />If you look through reviews, you will see either love it or hate it.  The ones that love it are looking to learn/understand the program.  The ones that hate it are most likely looking for a quick reference book or to learn the bare basics quickly which is totally fine as everyone has different needs but this book simply is not designed for that.
<br />
<br />I will say that the screen captures are not as good as previous versions but still acceptable.  Hopefully future versions will go back to the previous quality.
<br />
<br />Thanks to Haynes and Crumpler for their great work!</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. It taught me more about why behind exposure, color spaces, and image sourcing than any other book I have read. It provides a process for handling photos from the source to output in a variety of different media. The color spaces coverage is excellent. This is the book for those who want to understand the science and the concepts and then learn about the application having built a solid basis of technical understanding.</span>

                    <span>I am a Chinese student, I extremely want to study adobe photoshop, therefore I continuously am seeking good teaching material. But, I am all unsatisfied, until saw this book preceding edition Adobe Photoshop 7 Artistry. That is a excited night, also remembered I at that time that kind of happy feeling I to the present.I extremely thank this series author: Barry Haynes and Wendy Crumpler. May say like this ,they lead me to enter the Adobe Photoshop artistic palace. These cause me without hesitation to prepare to purchase this series the newest edition: Adobe Photoshop CS Artistry. But very is a pity, in my country, the newest this series is the Adobe Photoshop 7 Artistry translation edition, all does not have including the Adobe Photoshop CS Artistry English edition. Also has some other reasons to cause me to be unable to purchase, said to me very regrettably. But I or must produce the five-star appraisal in here, this is not excessive. This is may be called the classics the teaching material, I hoped will be able soon to see it on the bookshelf! </span>

                    <span>1. I'm in the minority here because I think this is a subpar book.  Just for some perspective, I've (unfortunately) purchased many many photoshop books over the years and thus this book is not the first one I've come across.  
<br />
<br />2.  The book looks very nice, color pictures etc... You would think a book this heavy, with such small font, with so many pages would be the ultimate photoshop book.   Reality--&#62; it appears to be a book with a lot of pages but with little substance.   Here is a very simple example:   I wanted to get some information on how to really use the gradient tool--&#62; there's like several pages on it, but more from a theoretical poitn of view.   There was no clear cut instruction how to actually use it.  Ultimately, when I go to a photoshop book, I want to immediately and easily learn how to do something.   This book amazingly does not do that.   Ultimately, I found my answer via Scott Kelby's book--&#62; very simple, to the point etc... 
<br />
<br />3.  Thus if you want to get a photoshop book to actually learn how to do things, I would recommend that you not get this book.  However, if you're an expert in photoshop and want to learn more about the nitty gritty and theoretical aspects, this book may have some pertinent information.  </span>
