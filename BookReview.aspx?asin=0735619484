Two experts in agile software development teach&#151;using a wealth of pragmatic examples in C# and other .NET development tools&#151;how to use automated tests to drive lean, efficient coding and better design. You&#146;ll focus on .NET-specific issues for TDD, including the best time to employ the inherent features of .NET class libraries and how to use NUnit, a leading unit-testing framework for .NET. And you&#146;ll see real-world examples of TDD-for .NET projects, including a Microsoft ADO.NET relational database, a user interface created with Microsoft ASP.NET and Microsoft Windows&#174; Forms, Web services, and other useful applications.</span>

                    <span>Many people think that Test-Driven Development (TDD) is all about testing software. In fact, test-driven development's main goal is not testing software, but aiding the programmer and customer during the development process with unambiguous requirements. The requirements are in the form of tests that the software must pass along the development process. 
<br />
<br />This procedure helps to insure that problems are found early and corrected while they are still small. 
<br />
<br />This book first discusses TDD from a conceptual point of view then gives a TDD example using a realistic application.

                    <span>I was really looking forward to this book as a complement to Kent Beck's more generic book on test-driven development. I was hoping it would cover a lot of "real-world" issue like web page development, databases, web services, etc. <p>To be fair, the book did try to cover these, but didn't do a great job of it. The database access layer was just plain boring to read through and the web page development chapter was thin on content. I was actually surprised how short the book was - about 170 pages actually covering the problems discussed. I also felt the ratio of code to discussion was too high. Lots of code, then 'the tests passed so we move on'...<p>I would love to see a book with better coverage of test-driven web development in .NET and perhaps with discussions of mock objects. I still think this is a decent book, partly because I am not aware of a direct competitor.</span>

                    <span>I give this book seven out of ten<p>What I liked about it:<br>It is easily to read. The topics are well presented and clearly defined.<br>The book introduces the concepts behind TDD (Test Driven Development) <br>Some of the less trivial aspects of TDD are discussed, like testing web services or using transactions.<br>Refactoring is introduced very well in chapter three.<br>The concepts of FIT are well explained and demonstrated. <p>In order to get a ten:<br>The book needs to decide who the target audience is. The material seemed too hard for a first introduction book and too simple for advanced developers. <br>As the book is about TDD it should have spent more time examining the benefits of developing software using this approach.<br>I would have liked to have seen more real world (hard to solve) problems tackled.</span>

                    <span>Obviously, the best way to learn TDD is by doing it, but a short tutorial like this helps immensely. I bought this book to fill in TDD and NUnit gaps after learning the ropes at work from an experienced TDD Java developer. The book covers the basic principals of TDD and provides a thorough NUnit tutorial. Other reviewers nitpicked the web unit testing section and the depth of coverage, but all neglected to mention that the book is mercifully short. What sort of depth do you want on a very complex and subjective topic like TDD in ~250 pages? In my opinion:<p>1) A good xUnit tutorial<br>2) Coverage of the principals of TDD<br>3) Basic examples of TDD principals and xUnit applied in the target language/platform<p>This book provides all three. After reading through just a few chapters, I embarked on a TDD-based project at work that now has several hundred tests. The info in the book directly contributed to a solid design for my tests, which has proven to be quite scalable across dozens of classes and an extreme amount of refactoring due to new requirements and bug fixing. I can't ask for more than that from such a short book.<p>In my opinion, it's not the author's responsibility to dictate the best tools to use for every single TDD situation--NUnit coverage is good enough to get any experienced programmer started, and it's really up to you to experience and discover the right tools for the job. TDD is a fairly new concept for .NETers (so new that MS won't have any tools of their own for TDD until Visual Studio 2005 is released), and tools are popping up almost monthly on SourceForge for testing ASP.NET, WinForms, and for integrating NUnit into Visual Studio.<p>Cheers to James and Alexei for putting forth such a great, short introduction to TDD for everyone on .NET.</span>
