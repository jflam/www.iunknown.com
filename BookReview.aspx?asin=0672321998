                    <span>In my opinion the best part of the book are chapters 12 and 13 which talk about animators Mark Fiore and Todd Gallina.
<br />The other chapters just didn't interest me.
<br />I prefer "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" and "Flash 5 Cartooning" over this book.

                    <span>I got this book when starting to get somewhat serious about Flash animation hoping it would teach me to do some serious animation. I was somewhat dissapointed that it didn't teach me anything I didn't already know from another book or from tutorial reading on the internet.<p>The book is good if you're starting out in Flash, infact, it's very good for that. It walks you through tweening, frame-by-frame animation, and the works. However, just by playing around and using common sense, I already knew all this.<p>The examples this author uses are very...creative and unique. That's not a bad thing, except you can't really apply them to everday animation.<p>All in all, this book is a good book if you're starting out. It will get you through the basics and a little more. If you're an intermediate or pro user, don't spend the money for it. I think the only way to get to know what you want to know is message boards or just practicing...</span>

                    <span>(contributor) Working with flash native files that were created by professional animators and reading how they were done is a great way to learn tips and tricks.  The books layout and design is  the best I've seen on the market.</span>

                    <span>The only worthwhile part of this book, is when Purcell intrerviews people who Flash for as a job, and questions them on techniques, tips, and tricks. These pages are very helpful (especially sound). You can tell Purcell himself is no an artist. If you check out the tutorials he wrote, they're just so stupid, and not useful (fighting skunks, a walking ostrich, etc.). However, the CD is great, and hearing pros talk about Flash is something new, it's a worth a buy, but don't bother with the tutorials, they're a waste of time.</span>

                    <span>Up front I will admit I have a bias (my company Pileated Pictures is featured on the book), but having been a professional involved with Animation and interactivity for years, and knowing the other people involved with this book, I can honestly say it is very useful and pragmatic, getting into fundamental concepts behind character animation in Flash, and a good luck at several techniques. My two cents.</span>
