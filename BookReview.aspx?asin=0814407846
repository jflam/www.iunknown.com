                    <span>This is a book written in 1995 and yet there is a whole chapter on DOS and other outdated technology. No office still uses DOS! With the ever changing technology in today's world, the author would have been so much better off skipping that whole chapter. Letter formats and telephone etiquette will still apply ten years from now, but when talking of computers; today's newest is tomorrow's obsolete. So get this book for general office information but not to become computer savvy or to learn of the software businesses are now using.</span>

                    <span>I just started a job as a secretary and my boss was no help in ttraining. I was lost. A friend recommended this book and it has been a lifesaver!! It has all the details and hints. After a couple of weeks, I looked like a pro. <P>If you are a boss, buy this book and make it part of your training. If you are a secretary like me, buy it and hide it in the drawer and next time you're stumped, I bet you find the answer here.</span>
