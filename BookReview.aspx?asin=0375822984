                <span id="Label1">Young doodlers and dreamers of the world, take heart--the famous Dr.  Seuss, creator of Whos and Sneetches, was a doodler and dreamer, too.  Kathleen Krull's engaging picture-book biography of Ted Geisel, the real  Dr. Seuss, takes us from his early childhood on Fairfield  Street in Springfield, Massachusetts, to the time when he's 22 years old  in Greenwich Village and just starting to think he might make a go of it as a person who draws flying cows. Krull tells a lively story,  carefully including details that help us understand how Seuss became  Seuss, from playground injustice (Geisel was a German American and World  War I loomed large) to his love for <I>Krazy Kat</I> comics.<p>  Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher, who also illustrated Seuss's <I>My Many Colored  Days</I>, cast Seuss's childhood in a nostalgic light with lovely,  old-fashioned paintings. A four-page section in the back picks up Seuss's story again,  taking us to 1937 when he launches his children's book career with <I>And to Think That I Saw It  on Mulberry Street</I> and all the way to his death in 1991. A  complete list of Seuss's books and recommendations for further research closes this fascinating look at one of America's most beloved  creators of children's books. (Ages 8 and older) <I>--Karin Snelson</I></span>

                    <span>It's hard to know where to place this biography of Ted Geisel: Boy On Fairfield Street reads with the action and drama of fiction, yet is a bona-fide account of how Geisel grew up to become Dr. Seuss. Paintings by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher accompany a lively discussion of how Geisel got his ideas. Good reading skills or parental assistance required for this in-depth biographical survey.</span>

                    <span>Do you know a child who feels out of step with the rest of their class? How about one that seems to annoy their teacher because they see the world differently? This biography was made for them!<P>Dr. Suess seemed to frustrate his teachers as his drawings were so different from all the other children in his class - in this book, readers will learn that he reveled in his uniqueness and embraced his unusual view of the world. As a result, he was able to find success as a cartoonist -- though it did take time.<P>The biography isn't just for little kids, but could be gifted to any "child" who needs to feel proud of their uniqueness. <P>Do you hear a drum beat that no one else can hear? Be glad you do -- you might grow up to be as successful as Dr. Suess.</span>

                    <span>A great biography for the under-12 crowd, The Boy on Fairfield Street is beautifully illustrated and tenderly written. From Ted's experiences with bullies to a humiliating experience with former President Theodore Roosevelt, Krull has shown the reader Ted's common failings as well as his extraordinary perseverance. Disappointing, however, is the short-stop ending just after Ted moves to New York at 22, before any of his famous children's books were written. There is an additional four page narrative but it is not fully illustrated as the rest of the story is and may leave some children cold unless they have help to get through it. Overall, a wonderful book that is just perfect for a celebration of Dr. Seuss's birthday on March 2 or a celebration of this year's Seussentennial.</span>
