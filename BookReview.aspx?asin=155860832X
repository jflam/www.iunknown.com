                <span id="Label1">In this new edition of their classic and bestselling textbook, authors Larry Peterson and Bruce Davie continue to emphasize why networks work the way they do. Their "system approach" treats the network as a system composed of interrelated building blocks (as opposed to strict layers), giving students and professionals the best possible conceptual foundation on which to understand current networking technologies, as well as the new ones that will quickly take their place.<br><br>Incorporating instructor and user feedback, this edition has also been fully updated and includes all-new material on MPLS and switching, wireless and mobile technology, peer-to-peer networks, Ipv6, overlay and content distribution networks, and more. As in the past, all instruction is rigorously framed by problem statements and supported by specific protocol references, C-code examples, and thought-provoking end-of-chapter exercises.<br><br>New to the edition is a downloadable network stimulation lab manual that allows students to visualize and experiment with core networking technologies in direct coordination with the book's discussion. Thanks to this and many other enhancements, <I>Computer Networks: A Systems Approach</I> remains an essential resource for a successful classroom experience and a rewarding career in networking.<br><br>* Written by an author team with over thirty years of first-hand experience in networking research, development, and teaching--two leaders in the work of defining and implementing many of the protocols discussed in the book.<br>* Includes all-new coverage and updated material on MPLS and switching, wireless and mobile technology, peer-to-peer networks, Ipv6, overlay and content distribution networks, VPNs, IP-Telephony, network security, and multimedia communications (SIP, SDP).<br>* Additional and earlier focus on applications in this edition makes core protocols more accessible and more meaningful to readers already familiar with networked applications.<br>* Features chapter-framing statements, over 400 end-of-chapter exercises, example exercises(with solutions), shaded sidebars covering advanced topics, web resources and other proven pedagogical features.<br>* Through a companion Web site (see button on this website), provides many additional resources, including a downloadable network simulation lab manual tightly integrated with the topics in the book.</span>

                    <span>Although this book clarifies the concepts of networking quite good, it lacks in-depth mathematical & statistical theory. 
<br />For those who are interested in the general picture, it's an excellent book. The authors actually succeeded quite good in not making it 'too dry'. For those who need 'more', like engineers and students in telecommunications/electronics, such as theories, applications and examples on efficiency, network performance parameters, etc., please look further as this book just doesn't offer that (and it probably never intended to).</span>

                    <span>This book is designed for someone who has prior knowledge with the underlying systems of a computer network.  It is fairly in-depth, and explains a lot, but I think that for a true beginner it is hard to comprehend.  I am working on a degree in Computer Science, so it wasn't like I was new to the idea of networking, but I found it hard to digest a lot of the technical aspects of this book.  Some things could have been made to be more of an overview, rather than in-depth explanation of how something works at a bit level.  I am now taking CCNA training, and some of the things talked about in this book do not relate at all to what someone needs to understand a working network.  </span>

                    <span>I'm really disappointed in this book.  It doesn't seem to go into that much depth in the third of the book I've read.  I learned far more from Steven's "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1" simply because although he may not cover everything he covers what he does well.  From that foundation you can learn other things.  Computer Networks doesn't seem to go into much detail and when it does it looks out of place.  It's odd to speak in generalities and then dive into some C code snippet.  I really thought it confusing to present the OSI architecture at a high level (and useless abstraction it is) and then contrast it with the "Internet Architecture" at a different level of abstraction.  Things are not presented like this in either Steven's book or Forouzan's "Data Communications and Networking".  They are understandable.  I'm not sure if the author tried to simplify things too much but I kept finding myself leaning on past knowledge to figure out what the author really meant and sometimes it seemed a stretch between what was presented in "Computer Networks" and what was presented in other references.</span>

                    <span>This review is for the 3rd edition.  I haven't finished reading this book, but I'm really impressed with it.  Obviously, computer networking is a huge topic area, and no one book can be all things to all people.  But if you're looking for an introductory book that provides a solid foundation of networking concepts and theory, then I strongly recommend this text!  <p>No one area is covered in exceptional detail.  Instead, it starts from the ground up in easy to read chunks that manages not to talk down to the reader, covering a wide range of topics in enough detail to allow the interested reader to further his/her studies with more advanced (and focused) material later on.<p>Contents:<p>1.
