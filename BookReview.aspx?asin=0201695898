                <span id="Label1">Written for the advanced C++ programmer, <I>ATL Internals</I> reveals the inner workings of the Active Template Library (ATL), the toolkit of choice for building today's lightweight Internet and server components.<p> The book begins with a tour of the ATL code generated by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6 AppWizard. The authors introduce fundamental ATL programming issues here, but they do not provide a general introduction to COM or ATL; they assume that readers have a good deal of background in both C++ and COM.<p> The book focuses on the extremely useful ATL support classes for managing strings (BSTRs), variants, and smart pointers. It covers the classes that help instantiate COM components (and examines support for different threading models and "creator" classes). The guide continues with object internals--covering object maps and the classes used to manage them--and interfaces, including aggregates and various interface design options. Information on ATL's support for persistence, which lets objects save and restore their state; on how ATL supports basic containers; and on interfaces that work with the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ is well done.<p> Later sections explain how to work with windows and ActiveX controls. After some material on events (and connection points), the authors reveal ATL support for basic window operations, including dialogs. For building a custom ActiveX control, the authors provide an excellent example of a nicely functional visual control. (This code will prove invaluable since it illustrates all the essentials of ATL component programming.) <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>ATL internals is the final word on ATL. No other book is needed to master ATL.<p>I have a good number of books on COM and ATL but getting  the low down on ATL starts and ends in this book. The coverage in unbeleiveable. It will make you think you were part of the ATL implementation team.<br>This book is not a short cut for learning COM programming.You should have a good understanding of how COM works and you also need to know your c++ well(emphasis on well. This book does not teach c++)<br>However, considering the .NET revolution, ATL may not be of much use for much longer.But if for some reason you need to learn ATL, this book is the ATL University.</span>

                    <span>This is simply one book that you do not want to be without when designing and implementing a COM project.  I purchased the book after I found myself in my first COM project and without any coworkers with any experience in this area.  As a comment, I've also rummaged around the Internet and purchase ...books in the effort to come up to speed as quickly as I can. ATL Internals is the best source of data on ATL that I've found so far. <p>ATL Internals not only discusses ATL but also does and excellent job discussing COM's theory of operation and how a Win32 OS supports COM.  <p>As a warning, however, ATL Internals isn't the only book that you need on a COM project because it is specialized on ATL (and on COM in general).  While ATL is useful it is not the only thing that you will have to deal with on a COM project.  You will probably need to work with IDL files and for that I can unequivocally recommend "Essential IDL" by Martin Gudgin.<p>ATL Internals accomplishes several things well; I will try to describe the most valuable aspects of this book.  One of the best properties of this book is that it is thorough.  It covers ATL in depth.<p>The following is a partial list of the material in ATL Internals:<p>1) ATL Internals covers using the wizards and explains how to proceed beyond the point where the wizards quit. <br>2) A though discussion of ATL facilities. For example: CComPtr  (a COM smart pointer), CComBSTR (a class wrapped around the error-prone BSTR datatype) classes are covered in detail.  The text conversion macros are completely covered here. In other books and on the internet I saw code examples that used them but will little explantion.   <br>3) Bug warnings, both your (potential) bugs and bugs within ATL.  The authors point out the buggy parts of ATL and they invest the necessary effort to warn out about aspects of ATL that, if naively used, create bugs. Numerous pages are dedicated to showing both how to correctly use certain hazardous parts of ATL as well as examples of buggy code.  Depreciated techniques are also described for completeness.  <br>4) Discussion and examples of various COM issues, including threading issues, connection points, the Service Control manager (SCM)and so on. <br>5) Detailed discussion of the numerous macros that Microsoft uses to conceal substantial code, (e.g. BEGIN_OBJECT_MAP, COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY_IMPL, etc.)  <br>6) One of the appendixes shows a cross reference between ATL classes and header file names.  This was a welcome convenience (yes I could have greped, but this is quicker)  <p>ATL Internals not only has great content but it is written in a very readable style.  The typeset is easy to read and the diagrams are well done.</span>

                    <span>I first bought this book because it was the only one I could find that had a discussion of ICollectionOnSTLImpl that I could understand.  I was already fairly familiar with ATL - at least how to use the wizards - but found that a lot of the documentation that was available was less than useful, especially the collections stuff.  <p>After successfully using Chapter 7 (Collections & Enumerations) for what I needed, I went back and read the whole book from front to back, and started really to understand what was happening under the covers - the whys and wherefores for all of the seemingly quirky little code chunks that I had seen peppered throughout my code, but not understood fully.<p>This book has become an indispensible resource, that I keep close at hand.  I can't really recommend it as a first book on COM or as an introduction to ATL, but this is not a criticism, because that's not its intended purpose.  For in-depth coverage of the workings of ATL, though, I haven't come across a better book.</span>

                    <span>Takes the background established by Don Box's "Essential COM" and shows the low level why and how of ATL.  If you want to know what DevStudio's wizards are doing for you, get this book.  It will help you interpet the Wizard-generated code.  The author was responsible for producing ATL, and he can write well too!<p>This book is NOT like Myers' applied C++ books, it does not apply ATL to any problems of note, it just very lucidly explains what ATL does for you and most importantly, the caveats!</span>

If you are a beginner, definitly buy Essential COM (by Don Box).<br>After reading Essential COM, you should own this book. It is excellent to learn ATL and as a reference too.</span>
