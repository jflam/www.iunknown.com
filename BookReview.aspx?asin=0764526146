                    <span>I've attempted to wade through many, many UML texts. Most have two things in common - they overwhelm you with terminology and/or they generally bore you to tears. Chonoles and Schardt's book was a pleasant surprise. They do a great job of simplifying concepts and diagramming techniques. And best of all, they don't weigh you down with terminology prematurely. They introduce buzzwords and phrases as they're needed in the text. 
<br />
<br />As for the downside, the only thing I can really complain about is the use of examples in the text. They beat on the same example(s) over and over (I feel like I know everything there is to know about air filters). Repetitive examples like that create a bit of a monotonous tone. But they do in fact get their point across, so it's ok I suppose.
<br />
<br />For folks looking for a definitive reference to UML 2, this is not the book. It's an introductory book only. But it's a GREAT introductory book. A true gem for UML neophytes.</span>

                    <span>Title is a bit offputting and initially I was reluctant to purchase this book because of that. Its not a bad book but its got nowhere as much detail as the UML 2 Bible. It does contain more useful content than UML Distilled 3rd Edition and Fast Track UML 2.0 though. 
<br />Postscript: Having spent more time with this book, I have to change my original opinion and rating. This is actually a rather good book and it is considerably better than several other rather superficial UML 2 books (UML 2.0 Fast Track and UML Distilled 3rd Edition) that are available. If you can get past the "for Dummies" title and buy this book you will not be disappointed. Don't waste your money on UML 2.0 Fast Track, UML Distilled 3rd Edition, UML 2 Toolkit and Teach Yourself UML 2 in 24 hours like I did, just get UML 2 for Dummies and then UML 2 Bible and you'll have everything you need to get a good grip on UML 2.0. I give it 3-4 Starts (can't figure out how to change original rating)</span>

                    <span>My impression of most "For Dummies" books has been that, while offering excellent introduction to a given subject, their lack of depth almost always leads to a follow-up purchase on the subject.  That is NOT the case here:  "UML 2 For Dummies" was an excellent tutorial for a UML novice like myself, and has continued to be a valuable reference as the software team I work with further incorporates UML into our development process.</span>
