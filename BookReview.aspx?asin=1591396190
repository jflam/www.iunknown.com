                    <span>Dr. Kim and Professor Mauborgne have successfully redefined the traditionally taken-for-granted academic and practical strategy from competition to value innovation.
<br />
<br />Blue Ocean Strategy, a landmark work by the most distinguished thinkers, is filled with wisdoms of economics, finance, marketing, organizational behavior, human resources management, and most importantly humankind's search for meaning.
<br />
<br />The authors challenge CEOs, top government officials and scholars to break through our intellectual and psychological attachment to the competition-based Red Ocean strategy.
<br />
<br />Organizations and entrepreneurs creating Blue Ocean strategic moves will survive and succeed in the increasingly globalized economy.</span>

                    <span>A Must-Read for anyone interested in making a difference for his company, his institution or for the public in general. This book gives you the tools to think out of the box and to succeed. It will help you concentrate on the customers needs rather than on your competition.  
<br />Kim and Mauborgne have produced a jewel: it is so well written and convincing that, after reading it, you will rethink your strategy in terms of opportunity and not in terms of war.

                    <span>As a professional strategy consultant to companies such as Merrill Lynch, GE, IBM and Pepsi -- I read as many as 100 business books every year.  I can say without question that Blue Ocean Strategy would be in my top 10.  Unique and powerful ideas, excellent examples, useful tools and real world application. I just finished the book this afternoon and then sat right down and created a "Strategy Canvas" for one of my key clients -- it gave me a whole new way to look at this company's strategy in direct comparison to their two largest global competitors - and showed me clearly where changes needed to be made in order to create a truly innovative approach to helping them grow their business.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book, it is definitely worth the invest of money and time -- as I am confident it will deliver several valuable ideas and tools to any reader that is interested in market creation and dominance.

                    <span>INSEAD Professors Kim and Mauborgne have written extensively about Blue Ocean Strategy / Value Innovation over the past few years in the Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal and other publications. With "Blue Ocean Strategy," they put their work into book form for the first time, and with very impressive results.
<br />
<br />In an era of globalization, rapid technological development and the commoditization of products, companies and countries need to find new ways to compete. In direct contrast to what most business school strategy professors teach, Kim and Mauborgne show that businesses cannot remain profitable through traditional "military-style" or "Red Ocean" strategy, working within existing markets to undercut competitors' prices or exploit ever-shrinking niches. Rather, they need to develop new markets, creating their own "Blue Oceans." Kim and Mauborgne provide examples of Blue Ocean successes (Southwest Airlines, Cirque de Soleil, Yellow Tail) and a methodology companies can use to develop "Blue Oceans."
<br />
<br />What I find most interesting is that profit-generating innovation tends to come not through technological development but through the development of new markets (Starbucks, Yellow-Tail and and Cirque de Soleil are not high-tech companies).
<br />
<br />A very thought-provoking and timely work that I highly recommend.

                    <span>I've struggled and watched my customers struggle with figuring how to do more and more for less and less.   We focus on squeezing out a bit more margin or a bit more growth in the ever-tightening markets of blood "red oceans."
<br />
<br />Blue Ocean Strategy is a fast, fun read on the business strategy of creating a new "blue ocean" market space based on building a new value curve where factors are created, eliminated, reduced, and raised.  
<br />
<br />My favorite case study was their story about [yellow tail] wines, which created new wine drinkers from people who previously drank beer or mixed drinks.  
<br />
<br />The book has also given me a framework to make better sense of the success of companies like Netflix and Whole Foods.
<br />
<br />The best parts for me are the charts and worksheets, which have made it easier for me to apply the authors' ideas in creating my own company's blue ocean strategy canvas.
