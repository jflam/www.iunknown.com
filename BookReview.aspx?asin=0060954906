                    <span>This book is one in a long series of books showing people how much the way they handle life, rather than what life throws at them, determines their success and - dare I say it - happiness.<P>This is one of life's tough lessons and most of us - myself included - continuously need to be reminded of it in order to muster the necessary self-discipline to keep in line with positive thinking.<P>As such, the book is well-written. It relies heavily on the author's own experiences, which lends credibility, but here and there is somewhat overdone. Personally, I somewhat sensed a lack of sophistication. This is probably partially due to all of the easy-to-remember lists of "3 P's", five qualities, 10 tools etc. There seemed to be very little padding between such lists. The scene where a pickles-salesman offers pickles to everybody on the plane and furthes demonstrates his tremendous attitude by stating "I love pickles" to me appeared Pythonesque.<P>Then again- if one of these lists really changes the way you get a grip on your life, this will be the most important you'll ever buy.</span>

                    <span>"..a bad attitude... is (an) early warning sign that you have abdicated you primary responsibility to take charge of your own life" - pg 94.<P>If desire is the fuel, then a positive attitude is the spark that will ignite your life. Like giving your car a periodic tune up, this book will help give your life some new spark plugs. We need to change, remove and replace or clean some old faulty belief systems that have lost their spark as well as remove the clogged oil filter that is filled with disappointments and adding some fresh new oil of thankfulness and gratitude. <P>The book reawakened my need to do an Attitude Adjustment. You probably won't find much new information or enlightment here and I had to struggle to finish reading the book because it relies heavily on the standard self-help tools that are found in nearly every book including self affirmations, visualizations, proper rest and eating, etc. But it was then I remembered the words of Anthony Robbins that a Master never tires of the doing the fundamentals. A positive attitude is FUNDAMENTAL to successful living. So as boring as it was, it still is essential and healthy reminder of a very important fundamental to successful living. So could you please pass me another one of those positive attitude spark plugs please?</span>

                    <span>I'll make you a deal - try the following suggestion and don't waste any money on this book. Do what I say here and you won't be sorry.<BR>First, if you want to change anything in your life or about yourself, tell yourself "I CAN" when approaching it. Next, every time you re-approach the attempted change (nothing happens instantly), add in "..and the more I do it, the better I get at it!" Third, don't worry about results (if you worry, you throw your mental machinery out of gear). Instead, just keep saying "I CAN, AND THE MORE I DO THIS, THE BETTER I'LL GET AT IT". And guess what?! You'll accomplish the change so fast you won't know what hit you - just don't worry or bother about perfection. Be light hearted and devil-may-care, and keep working the change while holding the saying I just told you in your mind. <BR>If you follow this simple formula, you'll save a LOT of money on these self-help books, accomplish fantastic things, and not have to waste time reading a lot of filler that covers up this same message - which is what books like ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING are all about! <BR>Also, if you still insist on reading this sort of stuff, get the grand daddy of them all - SUCCESS CYBERNETICS by Uell S. Andersen. It spells out everything these Johnny Come Lately authors say (or should I say, copy) from human cybernetics theories that SUCCESS CYBERNETICS covered back in the 1960's.</span>

                    <span>I heard Keith Harrell speak at a sales meeting in January and immediately bought his book. Keith is the real deal. He weaves stories about his life into the principles he reveals about how much our attitude effects our lives and the lives of those around us. He obviously has a relationship with God, and he uses that relationship as the foundation stone for his belief system. I highly recommend this book for adults and teenagers alike.</span>
