                    <span>What a wonderful little book that packs a great big wallop! If you are serious about connecting with people in business, and reaping the rewards that come with more and better relationships, then this is an absolute must-read book for you. <br> <br>I had the good fortune of reading Nick Boothman's first book, "How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less," while on a flight to a conference in which I was teaching. I was inspired by the simplicity and practicality of Boothman's approach. I began using his techniques before even leaving the airplane and continued to use them in the cab, the hotel, and at the conference. It was a breakthrough moment for me. My audience paid closer attention, laughed more, and learned more than any other I had previously served. This happened because I connected with them in a much stronger and more meaningful way-Boothman's way. I've been following Nick's direction ever since.<p>Now, Mr. Boothman releases a pitch-perfect sequel-"How to Connect in Business in 90 Seconds or Less." While this volume is grounded in the same principles as his first book, every page is crafted with the businessperson in mind. As I have read and re-read this snappy, entertaining, profound book, I am amazed at how much more Nick Boothman has to teach me about persuasion-the craft of getting people (in this case clients and other business contacts) to want to do what I want them to do. It's all KFC: Know what you want, Find out what you're getting, and, Change what you do until you get what you want. Sounds obvious, right? Wrong. If it were many more of us would be much more successful than we are.<p>Some of the material in this book is good basic sense that your mother told you but somehow leaked out of your head. Boothman puts that good sense back into your brain with a greater freshness, clarity, and practicality.<p>"How to Connect in Business in 90 Seconds or Less" illustrates the power of connecting with businesspeople quickly and consistently. Don't let your ego get in the way of picking up this book. You'll learn a lot stuff you thought you already knew.</span>

                    <span>I have been involved in marketing and networking for the last 30 years both in Europe and North America and thought I had learnt almost all I could about connecting in business. I was so wrong. On a recent transatlantic trip I read Boothman's book twice and put many of the suggestions to work at a function I attended at the end of the trip and was blown away by the positive reaction generated by using the techniques suggested.</span>
