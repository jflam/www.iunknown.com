                    <span>When the title said "partners" I assumed they meant a romantic relationship between a black woman and a white man that might have been outlawed pre-Loving v. Virginia.  But these are same-sex research partners.  Vivien is a black man.  (One of the first black men to serve in Congress was named Blanche, an appellation usually associated with women nowadays.)  When the title says "Heart," it is actually referring to the organ.  This work demonstrates that Charles Drew and George Washington Carver were not the only great African-American scientists.  This documentary shows how a rich, credentialed white doctor depended upon his black research assistant who didn't get the opportunity to attend college, though born into the black community's elite.  In the photographs that they show, it becomes very clear that some institutions which excluded blacks of all genders did include white women; the reverse of how voting rights were won.  Later in the documentary, a white female doctor helps the duo find a way to cure children with heart defects.  This is a great documentary for watching during Black History Month.  It may be inspirational to blacks (of any gender) and women (of any race) who plan to practice medicine.  Disney's "The Fox and the Hound" was a metaphor about whether white men and black men could be friends pre-1960s.  This documentary touches on that same theme.  It almost reminded me of the numerous interracial buddy flicks made by numerous black and white male actors.  In this film, there are far more reenactments than there are actual photos.  This suggests a paucity of visual details which is surprising given that this event happened less than 100 years ago.  This investigation into cross-race, cross-sex progress in a time of inequality may inspire many patriots and enthusiasts of American history.</span>
