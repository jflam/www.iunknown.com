According to the author, it is a house that is poetic, one that stimulates feelings and ideas.  In The Good Home, readers will discover, step by step, the picturesque techniques they can use to give their house a sense of soul-a character that arouses emotions and sentiment. Drawing from a full-color portfolio of "soulful" homes, this guide examines such interior and exterior design techniques as focal points, shaped spaces, transparency, and enfilade, as well as, lighting, landscaping, and much more. For anyone considering building a house who likes traditional building styles with a contemporary twist, The Good Home will be an important addition to the library.</span>

                    <span>This is a gorgeous book. The images are of extraordinary quality, and, like another reviewer commented, make one feel as though you're in the room. The text is, well, charming. And that's a good thing. This isn't a dry, academic tome, and the reader is engaged by the almost poetic descriptions. One really begins to think about what's being conveyed. My hat is off to authors Dennis Wedlick and Philip Langdon.<P>But foremost is the rare talent of Wedlick. There are many bad architects out there, and the global built fabric has been significantly diminished these past five decades by Bad Modernism (as opposed to the rare Good Modernism). More rare these past five decades are architects conversant with a language of tradition. Even rarer still are architects who work this ancient language with skill, humor, and economy of line. Wedlick, like Sir John Soane, knows how to break the "rules" without ever descending into silliness.<P>The crisp plans reveal an impressive attention to compact arrangements, and offer a rebuke to the needless Bigger Is Better phenomenon that has swept America. Wedlick is unusually adept at making sense from complicated geometry (notably with his star-shaped house). His ability to work with both a language of tradition AND modernism is remarkable, and it's to his credit that he has deftly maintained a foot in these opposing camps. The built world would be infinitely improved if more architects kept their feet engaged as such! <P>My only complaints are:<BR>1) The plans are grouped at the end, forcing one to flip back and forth while reading about a house.<BR>2) Some highlighted houses don't have plans!<BR>3) No site plans are included.<BR>4) There's almost no information about Wedlick. One yearns to know more about the man, his practice, and clients.<P>These concerns do not offset my giving the book five stars.</span>

                    <span>This is an enjoyable book. It consists of photo spreads of several homes by the architect author, with explanatory text. It's much more focused than similar books, but, like them, uses polished professional photography and ghost writing.<P>The theme is houses with Picturesque charm, or at least as much as can be had with new construction. I feel true charm is always accidental and only accrues over time, but, for those who feel instant charm is better than none at all, there are no better examples. At least for modern homes. Otherwise, Storybook Style: America's Whimsical Homes of the Twenties takes the cake.</span>

                    <span>Dennis is one of the most talented young architects in America. Anyone who has come into contact with his work, whether its been a real built home or an exhibit such as the ones put up in the Winter Garden at the WFC, Grand Central Station or the Mall of the Americas will walk away saying "that's really neat...I wish I could live like that for a day". Rarely has someone so gifted focused on designing and sharing those concepts with everyday people on budgets. Most architects with a quarter the talent are the ones that design impractical spaces for Wall Street budgets. Refer to the LIFE magazine house of the year series. Dennis' design is by far the most popular one built, in spite of trophy talent like Graves, and Stern sharing the winners circle. To the reader who said he was disappointed...think about this. The mere fact that Dennis' floor plans are in the book is invaluable....try buying a better floor plan for $50. That reader should stick to buying stock house plan magazines at the checkout counter.</span>

                    <span>The person who wrote that the houses seem impractical to live in does not know what they are talking about. I live in one of Dennis Wedlick's magical houses and I can attest to the fact that I find the space thoroughly livable and practical in addition to being inspiring. Every day in this house is a life-enriching joy and everyone who visits here comments on what a magnificent house it is. People leave here changed by the experience of the place. It is annoying when people write reviews about things they have no experience of whatsoever.</span>
