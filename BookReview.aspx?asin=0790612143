                    <span>This book will leave you scratching your head. Do not pay too much for it and you won't be disappointed. When it gets right down to it you might as well look for a plc with o.e. software because that's what you will need. Nice discussions on electrical basics and interfacing but just not practical or user friendly.There are just too many different devices to chase down and no real guidance as to where to get them. Writers should have non-technical people read their material before they publish.</span>

                    <span>I've read a lot of books on VB and PLC's but the book that I think about most and use as handy reference is Tom Leonik's --Home Automation Basics - Pratical apps using VB6.  This book is fun and to the point.  The example of a home monitor is cool and the material presented in the book can easily be applied to many different applications.  <p>The one reviewer who stated that you needed PLC software... obviously did not read the book.  PLC software is only needed to program the PLC.  The PLC in this application performs conditioning of inputs and stores key information in non-volatile ram.  The book creates a driver to communicate with the PLC in VB no other software is required.  This is an amazing task and it works.</span>

                    <span>This is an awesome book.  It shows how to render external events into a Visual Basic window. It even implements a communication link to an Allen-Bradley micro plc using only VB.  There's nothing like it.  Great Job, Tom Leonik.  I even adapted the software to communicate with an AB micrologix 1200 and it worked great.</span>

                    <span>I was very excited when I found this book and read the reviews. Chapter one was a small intro to visual basic. The first half of chapter two explained how to input and output with the serial port, great. Then I get to the second half of chapter two and I read that all I need to do is go and get a PLC interface. Why bother with the book then. If I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars on a PLC interface, just buy one which has software, and use the software which comes with it. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure for someone who already has a PLC and needs to revise their programs, this book would be valuable, however for the person who is interested in using the serial port to acquire ideas and tips for simple input/output application around the home, it is frustrating. Maybe the title should be Programming for the PLC in Visual Basic 6. That would be much more appropriate.</span>
