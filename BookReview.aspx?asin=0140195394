                <span id="Label1"><i>Home Design from the Inside Out</i> takes an unusual approach to home design. Author  Robin Lennon does away with the standard pictures of lavish interiors and exteriors for you to duplicate in  your home, and instead focuses on determining which designs, arrangements, colors, and decorative details will work best for your home, regardless of current trends. Lennon shows you how to  make your house feel like home by offering a unique, self-empowering look at home design that places the greatest importance on your tastes, needs, and preferences. </span>

                    <span>This is a wonderful book to help you become self aware.  There are exercises that you can do to help you determine who you really are & what you really like.  There are a broad range of subjects covering this  book such as Feng Shui, & Color Therapy.  Awesome book!</span>

                    <span>I bought this book at a time I was interest in Feng Shui and found out  that it really isn't about that afterall - and only one chapter is devoted  to that falsehood (as she interprets it - I do believe in the true Chineese  Feng Shui - not new age).  The rest of the book is very informative for we  decorators who believe that you should decorate your home for yourself and  its occupants - not for the neighbor.  One must be true to oneself and that  is what Lennon hopes you aspire too.  Peace!</span>

                    <span>Finally not just another book about what you should do with your looks or your life. For me, Home Design From the Inside Out made sense of everyday life. Not extravagent lifestyles, or impossible metaphysical demands, but real life, creative, processes which I can practice. Robin Lennon doesn't simplify or reduce these time honored ideas, but uniquely invisions them for how we live today. I highly recomend this book for artists and designers and for anyone looking to revitalize their life design.</span>

                    <span>If only there was truth in advertising -- then this book would be subtitled "How to sell the public just what it wants to hear." It's just another way to make a profit in New Age circles. This book is another pre-digested New Age primer passed off as the wisdom of Chinese thought. If you are credulous enough to buy and believe books like this, then you obviously aren't a trained artist, interior specialist, or mental health professional, and your idea of "Chinese culture" only goes as far as where you can get good take-out food.</span>

                    <span>Robin Lennon must be a very put-together woman!  Her advice goes far beyond where to place furniture and which colors go well with others.  After reading HOME DESIGN FROM THE INSIDE OUT I found the courage to throw away ancient artifacts from my youth and teenage years that should have gone in the trash long ago!  I never thought a book about interior design would be so helpful in my personal life.  I learned how to "create a home for my heart", and express my soul and creativity through my surroundings.  Open ANY page, and you'll find yourself shaking your head "yes", she's right, I just needed some one to put it to me like that.  It's only $14.95, and nearly 300 pages long!  Forget that new CD and BUY THIS BOOK</span>
