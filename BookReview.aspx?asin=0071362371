                    <span>I don't know if I'd agree with the subtitle; Seidman's guide is by no  means complete (for that, see Dowd's "Sea Kayaking") but it  certainly does cover the essentials of the sport, and as others have noted,  it is certainly sufficient to introduce a newcomer to all the essential  techniques needed to get started. While no book is a replcement for a good  teacher, Seidman gives you enough to get out and teach yourself basic  strokes, braces and perhaps even rolls- though that's something best seen  demonstrated first.<p>The photos are one of the strongest parts of the  book, and a good argument for buying it- next to the "Perforamance Sea  Kayaking" video Seidman's book has the best illustrations of basic  moves to be found anywhere. If you were only going to buy one kayaking  book, this would not be a bad choice- but after working your way through it  you'd be well advised to move on to more detailed and specialized books as  well.</span>

                    <span>I got into sea kayaking after reading this book and it is all the author said and more. I've lent this book to a number of friends who are now also "hooked".  This is an easy to read book, one that evokes the  possibilities of kayaking along with information necessary to develop the  confidence to make them happen. I highly recommend it to anyone considering  this great sport.</span>

                    <span>This book is exactly what I needed to guide me through the kayak shopping  and learning process.  It begins with equipment basics to help you choose  what's right for you and proceeds step by step through other basics of  kayak ownership, use and transportation.  I recommend it to all beginning  kayakers and to anyone who's considering buying a kayak.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This was the first book I bought after purchasing my kayak. It covers the gear you will need for paddling, safety and clothing. As well as discussing basic paddling and bracing strokes, a number of rescue techniques are covered, including the roll. Armed only with what I learned from the 8 pages on the eskimo roll, I went out and had myself rolling in two days. The book also include a chapter on family and handicapped paddling.<p>There is little coverage of extended or overnight trips.</span>
