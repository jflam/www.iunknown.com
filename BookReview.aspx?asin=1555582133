                <span id="Label1">Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5: Planning, Design and Implementation describes the best practices used during the planning, design, and implementation phases of projects to deploy Microsoft Exchange Server. It incorporates the author's general expertise gained from 16 years working with corporate messaging systems as well as experience gained from enterprise-level projects around the world, including Digital's own deployment of 55,000 Exchange clients across 160 servers. The new functionality of Exchange V5.5 is covered, but the real values lies in the pragmatic and practical attitude taken to solving the problems posed by large-scale implementations of any messaging system.<br><br>  This book shows system designers, implementation teams, and e-mail administrators what Exchange V5.5 is capable of and where it needs human assistance to succeed.<br><br>Covers Exchange 5.5 SP1 and advanced security and message journaling<br>Describes best practice used during the planning, design and implementation phases of deploying Microsoft Exchange Server<br>Foreword by Elaine K.

                    <span>This is a great book on Exchange. As well as the technical information there's alot of details on how you should design and implement Exchange - and at the same time the author takes the time to explain why. The thing I like best about the book is that whilst Tony Redmond is obviously a fan of Exchange, he is not afraid to point out its limitations.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is as much about Exchange as it is an advertisement for Microsoft. Tony Redmond spent about as much time explaining Exchange as he did praising Microsoft and its so-called innovations with Exchange. He touts Digital as having one of the largest Exchange deployments. Well, duh! Would Digital have deployed Exchange at all if Microsoft hadn't ported NT on Digital's Alpha chip? And how could he even name one of his chapters "The Joy of Managing Exchange"? Any mail administrator who's been in the business knows that managing a mail system is no joy at all! The book does have some good information both theory and practice, if you can stand his constant praiseful and admiring comments about Exchange (or else have a bucket nearby).</span>

                    <span>By now most IT pros know Exchange 5.5 is a vast product. The implications are a "New World Order" for IT. Benefit from Tony's rich experience (he came from Exchange-implementation-award-winning DEC when Compaq bought them, like I did, too). Understand this book is exactly what it says and what you need to do foremost: PLAN! Other books were better at helping me earn by MCSE with Exchange elective. It's the definitive bible for Exchange implementations. I've seen it on more CIO and IT managers' desks than any other single publication.</span>
