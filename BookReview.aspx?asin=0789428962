                <span id="Label1">It's become trendy for business books to exhort managers to "empower"  their people and imbue them with a sense of workplace "ownership"--still, it all  comes down to the vexing question of how to motivate people to do their best  work everyday. In its 72 sprightly and well-designed pages, this hardworking  pocket-sized book shows you how to do just that. First, you'll learn how to tap  into what it is your people really want from their jobs (other than a paycheck  and paid holidays); then, how to act on those needs to get them really psyched  (by improving communication, encouraging initiative, and creating a "no-blame"  work culture); and fire them up to give their best, both individually and in  groups, by preventing or resparking "demotivated" workers, enriching each job's  potential and scope, and helping them build their career profiles. More  importantly, you'll learn how to reward employee achievement by motivating  through change, recognizing exceptional performance, and keeping motivation at a  constantly high level. On every page, boxed tips, quick-reference checklists,  vivid mini case studies, and easy-to-follow flow charts make the motivation  process not only clear and simple to activate, but even rather fun. Granted, if  you're looking for very specific or in-depth guidance, you might find this book  too cursory and general in its approach. But, if you're looking for a thumbnail  guide to the basics, it'll do just fine.<p>  It's worth mentioning that the book is part of the "Essential Managers" series  by reference publisher Dorling-Kindersley--a series comprising 20 itty-bitty  books on business and career topics that range from communication, leadership,  and decision-making to the management of time, budgets, change, meetings,  people, projects, and teams. Combining the talent of the "For Dummies" book  series for breaking down a lot of information into bite-sized bits and sidebars  with Dorling-Kindersley's signature design style of crisp, classy graphics on a  gleaming white backdrop, the books don't represent the cutting edge of business  thinking or reflect necessarily any unique individual perspective. Instead, it's  as if someone had collated the best general thinking on these 20 topics, and  rolled them out into 72 brightly designed and easy-to-read pages--studded along  the way with boxed tips, color shots of a multiracial cast of "coworkers"  animatedly hashing through the workplace issues of the day, and, on the last few  pages of each volume, a self-test of one's skills in the topic at hand. Again,  they're not for anyone who's looking for more in-depth or focused help on any of  the covered subjects, but they're perfect as a quick general-interest reference;  and, let's face it, they're so damn cute, and look so smart in a neat little  stack or row, that probably you'll want to buy a whole bunch to give as gifts to  your entire staff or department. <I>--Timothy Murphy</I></span>

                    <span>It has ever been my observation that where there is no motivation, the staff tends to fall prey to being lazy-bugs, dumb and losing their charm and interest in their jobs! People who adopt TQM (Total Quality Management) which is about constantly improving every process and product by progressive methods motivate with the Change and quip for empowerment at workplace. If there isn't Motivation, however well you want TQM, it fails as psychologically needs is not fulfilled. Self esteem is hurt too. Recently, during my Insurance Group meet, the young boys supported the training with motivational tips that promoted Discussions, provided information and feedback but missed out on encouraging initiatives. Effectively appraising, listening to opinions, discussing weaknesses are all best explained in this book. Raising Interest levels and developing skills is one yet two different things altogether. The book has techniques to widen perspectives too and getting the most from Training sessions. An Exceptional Book, I recommend for all Team Managers who need to 'Motivate' freshers and tune them up for Achievement. A good Pick and Great Gift to offer.</span>

                    <span>Robert Heller is a leading authority on management consulting. He was the founding editor of Management Today. He has written this book to teach you all you need to know about how to motivate people. Motivating people will show you how to increase production and job satisfaction. It will provide you with practical techniques like rewarding achievement. <p>Are your employees overloaded with work? Are they clearly demotivated? When you start to see the negative signs you might also see absenteeism is increasing. You could try a employee survey or you can analyze your own talks with your employees to find out what they are feeling. <p>Some of the power tips I enjoyed reading:<p>"Praise work well done, even if some targets are missed." -pg. 24 "Provide training in small, regular doses rather than one long course." -pg. 45<p>Very practical and I think the points in this book will help you to create a more positive work environment for your employees.</span>

                    <span>This is a great little handbook.  The little motivational tips throughout are things that can easily be done in the workplace on a daily basis with little effort, yet act as motivators for employees.  A lot will seem simple  and common sense but those little things are sometimes lacking in the work  environment.</span>
