                    <span>As a die-hard Red Sox fan since 1979, I never thought I'd see the day when there would be a "Word Series Championship" video, or DVD, but yes, it really did happen.  The Red Sox really did win the World Series.  
<br />
<br />I had a tough time deciding between getting this DVD, or the other 2004 World Series one.  I didn't want to get both, because I figured there would be a lot of the same material, and highlights on both, but I chose this one, because I saw it in the store first.  A couple of my friends have the other DVD, and I've also seen that one.  That one's good too.
<br />
<br />This DVD captures the Red Sox incredible 2004 season, from spring training to the last out of the World Series, and even shows highlights of the victory parade.  The extra features on the DVD, including interviews with some of the players, are also nice.
<br />
<br />This DVD is a must for not only Red Sox fans like myself, but also baseball fans who appreciate the history of the game and also enjoy great sports moments.
<br />
<br />Hopefully, there'll be a 2005 Red Sox World Series Championship DVD, but for now, this one will do just fine.

                    <span>I may have had higher expectations for a season covering DVD. I wanted more on the Yankee series. A lot more detail for coming back from 3 games down is NOT just a matter of fact. That was the epic event and the World Series was really anti-climatic. </span>

                    <span>I had purchased the MLB video for the World Series that came out prior to the release of "Faith Rewarded," and while it was a decent recap of the season and playoffs, "Faith Rewarded" is SO much better.  They did an amazing job capturing key moments of the season.  Showing the team sharing the WS victory and trophy with Johnny Peske was SO AWESOME... brought a tear to my eye.  Red Sox fans, you will not be disappointed by this DVD, it is a must for any Sox fan who wants to relive the glory of the 2004 season (even better than the Patriots 2003 season video!).</span>

                    <span>As a die-hard Red Sox fan who waited a lifetime for last October, I thought that NESN did a great job detailing the successes and struggles of the 2004 Red Sox season - culminating in the historic defeat of the Evil (choke!) Empire and an "Impossible Dream" World Series Victory.
<br />
<br />There are some shared scenes with the MLB World Series DVD, which was somewhat disappointing, but the NESN DVD chronicles much more of the 2004 regular season than the World Series DVD, including the July 1 and July 24 battles with the Yankees. I wonder if A-Rod can still taste Veritek's glove?   
<br />
<br />I would have liked to have heard season commentary from Jerry Remy and other former Red Sox greats (as on the World Series DVD), but I guess you can't have everything. The NESN DVD does provide extended highlights of the victory parade in Boston, which is something worth keeping.
<br />
<br />All in all, the DVD is very well done and is a great addition to any Red Sox fan's DVD library along with the World Series DVD. Highly recommended.

                    <span>NESN--New England's Regional Sports Network has come up with a very good video--even if some of the material is already on other videos like the World Series one.  Of course as a Yankees fan it's tough to relive the fight on July 24th and then the biggest choke (comeback) in all of baseball.  Somehow the trade for Nomar Garciaparra was the catalyst and made Theo Epstein a boy genius.
<br />
<br />The video was done in the same way the Yankees championship videos were done in the past with titles for each chapter.  The camerawork was a bit shaky and as I said some of the material has been seen on the official MLB World Series video.
<br />
<br />I am someone who loves the city of Boston itself regardless of politics or sports and I'm proud to call it my second home/adopted hometown.  This no doubt is the number one moment in Boston Sports History.  Just as the Yankees are the lifeline of NYC sports, the Sox are the lifeline of Boston.  This really gave fans the inside look at one of the most incredible baseball teams of all time.
<br />
<br />But let me say this--it took 86 years to win it all--and it will take another 86!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br />
<br />Baseball fans will like this as it does give that more in-depth inside look at what it took for the Red Sox to end the Curse of the Bambino--somehow I think Babe is sleeping rather peacefully--and maybe even talking to Ted Williams over whatever it is they drink in heaven</span>
