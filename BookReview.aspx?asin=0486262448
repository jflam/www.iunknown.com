                    <span>With stories by Tolstoy, Pushkin, Gogol and Chekov this is a great book to help you improve your Russian skills and read the masterworks in the original. It's a great way to check your Russian against the English tranlsation on the opposite page. <P>The book itself has been around for several years and while it is a bit expensive for what you get used editions are fairly common. My only real criticism is that this is one of the few dual readers available in the US on the Russian language. Hopefully the publishers will remedy this by printing another volume. A real must for Russian language students.</span>

                    <span>This dual-language book features twelve shortstories by 19th-century masters of Russian literature. The pages are specially formatted with Russian Cyrillic on the left opposed by English translation on the right. The Russian and English texts match eachother nearly line-for-line, simplifying cross-reference. Here is an entertaining way to enrich vocabulary and perfect syntax, for the intermediate to advanced student who already has the basics of grammar. The editor chose some great examples of Russian writing, including Pushkin's haunting "Stationmaster", Gogol's grotesque "Nose", and Dostoevski's macabre graveyard drama "Bobok". Only one thing detracts from the book's usefulness as a learning tool, which is that many of the phrases and expressions are somewhat archaic. There are several dual-language compilations of contemporary (Soviet) shortstories available, for those who prefer to familiarize themselves with more modern language usage.</span>

                    <span>If you are sort of good at Russian but feel you have a long way to go, this is a painless way to study. The stories are interesting, and the immediate translations are great. Russian is a tough language! This book lets you read Russian as people speak it, which is better than drill and practice exercizes. I wish I still had my copy, but I left it in Moscow for my translator. It is also good for learning English if you are a native Russian speaker.</span>
