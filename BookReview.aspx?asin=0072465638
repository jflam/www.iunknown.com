                <span id="Label1"><i>Database Management Systems</i> provides comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of the fundamentals of database systems. Coherent explanations and practical examples have made this one of the leading texts in the field.  The third edition continues in this tradition, enhancing it with more practical material.    <P>The new edition has been reorganized to allow more flexibility in the way the course is taught.  Now, instructors can easily choose whether they would like to teach a course which emphasizes database application development or a course that emphasizes database systems issues.  New overview chapters at the beginning of parts make it possible to skip other chapters in the part if you don't want the detail.  <P> More applications and examples have been added throughout the book, including SQL and Oracle examples.  The applied flavor is further enhanced by the two new database applications chapters.</span>

                    <span>In my opinion, it's one of the best books on the subject, and it is for a reason that this textbook is used in Berkeley's undergraduate EE/CS database CS186 course. I read reviews below from some of the straight 'A' students that the book is too complex and confusing. Others complain it doesn't cover common DBMS vendor implementations (Oracle, SQL). Again, this is a well-written book that thoroughly covers the theory behind every vendor's database design, and it's difficult to see why one would expect it to be an easy reading. If you like serious, unwatered-down textbook style reading that requires some thought on your part then this book is right for you.</span>

                    <span>I feel like reading puzzle while reading this book. If this is a book for advanced user, why my professor use it in the database introduction course ? 
<br />
<br />a lot typo in the text and many exercise answers are incorrect. countless sentences in the book just hard to read. don't waste your time and $100 on this book!!</span>

                    <span>Well, I am sure authors have a lot of experience in the field of DBMS. However, what they wrote is just experience, not concept or formal definition. It is extremely easy for beginners to get entangled in the lengthy and vague chatting description. For those who know something about DBMS like me, this book turns out to make them more confused. I think even the writting style needs much room to improve. My have-to course requires this textbook, but I avoided buying it. Hohoho! spending over 100 bucks on this? I don't think so. I borrowed it from my friend only for the test. If you look for a good book, try "Database Systems Concepts" or "Database Systems Implementation". They are really good, at least for me.</span>

                    <span>This book was required for my database course, so I didn't really have a choice about buying it.  It has numerous typos (I stopped marking them when I hit 7 or 8 by the third chapter) which often cause problems because they're not spelling errors but rather substitutions of terms or incorrect figure numbers.  Also, a large portion of the questions at the end of chapter 5 cover material that is not presented until chapter 6.  <p>I'm a college student so I don't have much money.  I've had to buy 2 additional books for this course just to understand what's going on.  There are VERY few examples (it really seems like the more complex the topic, the fewer examples are shown).  Figures are usually only printed once, even if they are referred to repeatedly, so be prepared to spend time flipping back and forth to view a table that was shown to you several chapters ago.<p>Moreover, formal definitions are given without explanation.  As a 'learning' tool this book does more harm than good.  It might have some value as a reference book because it concisely covers a very wide range of topics.  The book makes more sense if you read it when you already know/understand everything (maybe that's why some instructors seem to love it).  However, for students it's like trying to put a puzzle together when you don't have all the pieces and you don't have a clue what the picture is supposed to look like.  By the way, I'm also a straight 'A' senior, and trying to learn from this book has been one of the most frustrating and unrewarding experiences I've had in college thus far.<p>Just BEWARE!!!</span>

                    <span>This is the worst text book that I have ever used. The author seems to have no experience of writing text book. The concepts are not explained in the clear/easy understandable way. After reading some of the topics, I did not feel help rather confused. I am really disppointed. I will not recommend this book to any one since it is   a big waste of money:-(!</span>
