                    <span>I bought this book from Amazon.com many years ago and have fully enjoyed it. It has a lot of variety with the recipes, it also has a section on Italian Cream sodas, which are very good, especially in the summer time when you would rather have something cool as opposed to something hot. Most all the syrups can be bought from Da Vinci Gourmet if you have no place to buy them in your home town. My favorite recipes vary with this book, but I have tried many. The two best would be Strawberry Amaretto Mocha and Coffee Toffee. Although I do find all of them very good. I wish there were more books like this, it mostly contains all recipes which was what I was looking for.</span>

                    <span>My husband and I found this book a delight when wanting something other than plain coffee.  With the variety of sugar-free syrups out there now, one can enjoy some of the most decadent cups of 'dessert' available with little affect to the waistline.  If you enjoy coffee, cappuccino and/or espresso, you will likely use this book often.</span>

                    <span>This book gives U.S. coffee lovers hundreds of recipes with which to become coffee'd out! I particularly found the section on espresso, as well as Cappuccino, good. In Australia we have always had a strong coffee culture, based largely on the European experience, and therefore most of the recipes here will remain untried by me.<br>The book should interest most American coffee lovers with all those flavour variations for their coffee, and for all other coffee lovers, this book will be fun to own as a keepsake and curio on coffee.</span>

                    <span>The size is perfect for a quick kitchen reference book. The format is user  friendly and has a certain charm. It is not the best guide for begining  cappuccino makers as the directives are vague regarding how to make the  perfect cup of expresso. As the book points out itself, in order to get a  perfect cappuccino, you must first brew a perfect expresso.  Overall, I  enjoyed the recipes and like the fact that cold drinks were included for  the warmer months. The price makes it an easy addition to any kitchen that  has an expresso machine.</span>

                    <span>This book has every catigory of coffee beverage and is great for the beginner, or as a gift for the friend who just bought there first cappuccino/expresso machine.  I found lots of interesting drinks to try, hot and cold as well as lists and ideas for flavors to go with the drinks.  I brought it home and read it, then tried several items all that same night.</span>
