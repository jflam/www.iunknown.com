                <span id="Label1">There was a time, not too long ago, when the typewriter and notebook ruled, and the computer as an everyday tool was simply a vision. <i>Revolution in the Valley</i> traces this vision back to its earliest roots: the hallways and backrooms of Apple, where the groundbreaking Macintosh computer was born. The book traces the development of the Macintosh, from its inception as an underground skunkworks  project in 1979 to its triumphant introduction in 1984 and beyond.    The stories in <i>Revolution in the Valley</i> come on extremely good authority. That's because author Andy Hertzfeld was a core member of the team that built the Macintosh system software, and a key creator of the Mac's radically new user interface software. One of the chosen few who worked with the mercurial Steve Jobs, you might call him the ultimate insider.  When <i>Revolution in the Valley</i> begins, Hertzfeld is working on Apple's first attempt at a low-cost, consumer-oriented computer: the Apple II. He sees that Steve Jobs is luring some of the company's most brilliant innovators to work on a tiny research effort the Macintosh. Hertzfeld manages to make his way onto the Macintosh research team, and the rest is history.  Through lavish illustrations, period photos (many never before published), and Hertzfeld's vivid first-hand accounts, <i>Revolution in the Valley</i> reveals what it was like to be there at the birth of the personal computer revolution. The story comes to life through the book's portrait of the talented and often eccentric characters who made up the Macintosh team. Now, over 20 years later, millions of people are benefiting from the technical achievements of this determined and brilliant group of people. </span>

                    <span>This book is phenomenal, and really took me more inside of the actual development of the Macintosh than any other book I have read. It is told by Andy Hertzfeld who was on the original team, and brought in just as Jef Raskin was pushed aside by Steve Jobs who saw this as the future of the company.
<br />
<br />It is told in a series of fairly chronological anecdotes that really bring a clear picture of the entire development of the original Mac, from it's origin as a sort of skunkworks to it becoming so large it had to have managers that actually forced many of the original and most talented members of the Macintosh team to leave Apple and move on to working elsewhere. And it ends with Steve Jobs oust from the Company by John Sculley from Pepsi who Jobs had brought in (Sculley would bring Apple to the point of collapse and made a deal with Microsoft that allowed them to make WINDOWS and force Macintosh into the small portion of users that it has today).
<br />
<br />The book also has wonderful photos of the people involved as well as prinouts and photos of the early development of the programs and GUI for the Macintosh. 
<br />
<br />If you are a mac-head run out and get this book right now!!!</span>

Andy's deeply personal account of that "revolution" in that now famous valley is diamond sharp.</span>

<br />Evolutionary scientists are fond of emphasizing that the world as we know it is fundamentally an outcome of a random series of sequences involving biomasses, chemicals, bacteria, and other goodies heated at high temperature and simmered, like soup, over centuries, until it resulted in "us". In the late seventies and early eighties, there were the Apple Computer Company, the author and his inspired colleagues, Silicon Valley technology developments, a business economy open to new ideas, the vision and energy of Steve Jobs, and more. Occasionally, good things happen historically out of the random interaction of essentially unrelated components. This is how the Macintosh computer came to be.
<br />
<br />The story is told in "Revolution in the Valley - The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made". This is a wonderfully-produced book written by one of the major principals in the development of the Mac, Andy Hertzfeld, a software engineer. The story unfolds in about 80 short recollections and anecdotes, mostly contributed by Hertzfeld, memoir-like. A small handful were contributed by other principals in the Mac's early development - Steve Capps, Donn Denman, Bruce Horn, and Susan Kare, the legendary graphic designer responsible for most of the enduring interface symbols.
<br />
<br />The focus is primarily on the people who made the Mac. They were primarily young, enthusiastic, motivated nerds who possessed creativity and genius. There was no shortage of creative geniuses in the nascent computer industry at that time, but the group which created the Mac was special because the Mac was special. It was different. It was the first computer designed to be (relatively) easy to use. It was meant to be for everyone, not just the techno-nerds and corporate spreadsheet wonks, but for those others creative and cognitively nimble enough,  to encompass the computer as a desktop metaphor with powerful and handy tools and features. It was meant to change the world. And it did.
<br />
<br />Like the primordal, evolutionary ooze, the synergistic interaction of these people with the developments around them in computer technology, the idealism and vision of people in the Silicon Valley environment, and the shear dynamic force of the computer itself, created an outcome which clearly is significant to many people, and special to Mac fans.
<br />
<br />The history of the early Mac is inherently of interest, but the presentation here makes it feel special. The production values of this book are topnotch. This is a hefty hardcover very well designed to not only convey the story, but to evoke the culture and ethos surrounding Mac history in both words and images. There are scans of contemporaneous personal notes and sketches by some of the engineers and designers. There are plenty of individual and group photos of the relevant personalities. There are photos of the work environment, the hardware, and the look of the software as it evolved. There are loads of illustrations of original graphics designs, icons and fonts, and screen images. The overall look of the book evokes the aesthetics of the time period with interesting use of colored text, page layouts, and fonts, together with graphics of early topical magazine covers, advertisements, and media presentations, and more. Except for the lack of music, everything is here and ready for a Ken Burns video production. Seriously.
<br />
<br />Of course, the stories are most important and there are plenty of interesting and humorous memories of people and events. Steve Jobs is the chief character, of course, but Bill Gates and Mick Jagger play roles as well. The story of how a pirate flag was flown over one of Apple's design buildings reflects the attitude, in part, which inspired the Mac development team. For the nerdiest fans, the story of how the "marching ants" representation of a screen selection in graphics programs came to be, is a treasure.
<br />
<br />This is an exceptional production.</span>

                    <span>How was the Macintosh made? How did it evolve? What are the stories of the people who created it? Revolution in the Valley is a series of anecdotes compiled by Software Wizard Andy Hertzfeld about the early days of the Macintosh.
<br />
<br />Andy first began to tell his tales of the Mac's creation on his website, Folklore.org. Not long after, Tim O'Reilly approached him about the possibility of compiling the stories into a book. Browse Folklore.org and you can still read most of these stories online, but Revolution in the Valley presents them in a more comfortable, enjoyable format.
<br />
<br />Every story Andy presents is an entertaining read, but most fascinating are the tales of chance. Luck and the determination of individuals working on scorned projects played a decisive role in the formation of user interface characteristics that we take for granted today.
<br />
<br />The Lisa, for example, almost had an interface based on dialog boxes. It was the surreptitious work of Bill Atkinson and Dan Smith that gave us the icon-based Finder we use today. In another story, Andy tells of how the "OK" button was labeled "Do It" - until one user asked why his computer was calling him a "Dolt."
<br />
<br />Equally interesting are the features that didn't make it. The original Macintosh almost had a slot (euphemistically called the "diagnostic port") until management realized what it was really supposed to be. On the more whimsical side, had it not been for limited ROM space, "Mr. Macintosh" would have appeared in a menu waving his hand, once every couple thousand times the user pulled down a menu.
<br />
<br />Revolution in the Valley is a fascinating book which anybody reading this site [Applefritter] will enjoy immensely. Even if you don't buy a copy, at least head over to Folklore.org, where you can read many of the stories online.</span>
