                <span id="Label1"><I>The Zope Book</I> is an authoritative guide to Zope, an open-source Web application server. Zope goes beyond server-side scripting languages like PHP by providing a complete object framework, a built-in Web server, a Web-based management interface, and load-balancing through ZEO (Zope Enterprise Objects). That's a considerable punch, and Zope is attracting increasing interest from developers looking for an alternative to heavyweight commercial application servers. Zope is implemented in Python, an object-oriented scripting language, and runs on Windows, Linux, and Solaris.<p>  Written by Zope developers, this title is concise and to the point. It is aimed at people new to Zope as well as current users, although some existing knowledge of Web technology is necessary. The book is organized into three parts. The first part is introductory, outlining how Zope works and explaining basic DTML (Document Template Markup Language), a tag-based language for server-side scripting. The second, and longest, part tackles users and security, scripting with Python or Perl, using Zope's built-in search engine, and connecting to relational databases. Part three covers scaling and extending Zope, with a short chapter on ZEO and information on creating your own custom Zope classes. Reference material is contained in two appendices, one for DTML and the other for the core Zope API.<p>  <I>The Zope Book</I> offers an excellent, high-level view supplemented by more detail for the most common development tasks. The authors refer you to Zope's documentation or other resources for the most advanced or specialist topics. The result is ideal for evaluating Zope, and also useful for getting started with Zope projects. <I>--Tim Anderson, amazon.co.uk</I> </span>

                    <span>Although Zope may be the leading open source Web content management platform, it has suffered from a lack of comprehensive documentation. This book, and similar titles from Linux Journal Press and Sams, have begun to address this issue, hopefully bringing greater interest in the platform.<P>The Zope Book was written by Zope developers and is targeted at Web developers and admins who have some experience with Web applications but possibly not content management technology. <P>Part 1, Introducing Zope, is designed to get the reader started with Zope, explaining how to download, install, and configure the software using the platform's graphical interface. The section describes what Zope can do, explains the basics of the Zope content object model, and introduces Zope's server-side templating environment, Document Template Markup Language (DTML). <BR> <BR>Part 2, Creating Web Applications with Zope, gets into the meat of actually making Zope applications. The section talks about scripting with Python and Perl, user security searching, connecting to a variety of relational databases, metadata, and advanced DTML.<P>Part 3, Developing Advanced Web Applications with Zope, covers the Zope Enterprise Objects model, scaling and extending Zope, and Zope classes.<P>Appendixes include DTML and Zope API references and a guide to Zope resources, including mailing lists and Web sites.<P>The Zope Book is not the ultimate Zope refernce, and isn't meant to be.</span>

                    <span>Zope (and Python) have gained wide spread audiences over the last couple of years and this book is a great companion to anyone that wants to get in on the hype or wants a book to review all areas of the Zope technologies. If you are unsure if you or your company should switch to a Python/Zope solution when developing websites, you should give this book a read and you will feel more confortable to give it a try.<P>The book is very easy to understand and it's not really a technical reference. It simply dabbles in many different areas in the Zope technology and covers them all very well. The author is very brief and you'll be able to see what Zope is all about after a few days of reading.<P>Zope is definately a new, innovative way of developing websites, much along the lines of java enterprise and other collaborative web application servers. If you program in PHP or Perl and want more colloboration, power, sleaker and well structured designs and faster development time, you should look into Zope and purchase this book.<P>This is the best Zope book out there today! Great job to the authors, Amos Latteier and Michel Pelletier, and it's technical reviewing staff who have done a great job making this book flow nicely and without error.</span>

                    <span>Basic concepts are, I think, well presented. This is terribly important because even those of us who are used to working with web applications might find Zope very different from anything we've used before. This would earn it four stars except for one serious flaw: the book is rather dated. There is no coverage at all of Zope Page Templates or METAL, which are very important topics in today's Zope. <P>I reduced the rating to three stars because of essential deployment topics that I wanted to see covered that were also completely missing. SSL, the zope.conf file, using Zope in conjunction with Apache, for example. There's probably more, but I just don't know yet that I don't know them.<P>So I give it three stars for being useful, but having significant flaws. You are better off going to Zope.org and getting the latest on-line docs from there.</span>

                    <span>I think a lot of the reviewers for this book are blinded by the fact that Zope is an incredibly cool and powerful technology, especially for the price.<P>By all means wax lyrical about the capabilities of the platform. Be thankful that it is finally becoming accepted, documented, and widely deployed. But please don't think that this book is great, just because it talks about Zope and is written by a couple of very well-respected zopistas.<P>I was quite disappointed by this work. It fails to deliver on the promise of teaching you how to build useful applications in Zope. It's 350 pages of "what Zope is" and about 34 pages of "how to use it to do something useful".<P>This is a common problem with most Zope documentation - the authors themselves get carried away with the technology and fail to point out how it might be usefully implemented. Yet sadly, the Zope community really, really needs a task-focused book like that.<P>As an introduction to what Zope is, though, this book's not too bad - even if it is a rewrite of online documentation. Hence three stars.</span>

                    <span>If you need to learn Zope, buy this book. That said, if you're already working with Zope, don't bother. This is the official introduction to Zope, and for that, it's excellent. I've bought every book available on Zope, and this is by far the best introductory volume. But as soon as you need to get past the introduction, you'll need to get more information somewhere else. In part this is because Zope is such a quickly evolving platform that any printed material is inherently outdated before the ink can dry. I can't sing the praises of Zope loud enough, and this is THE book to get you started. Buy it, by all means. But be prepared to look for more once you've grasped the beginnings of what promises to be the greatest web application/CMS platform available.<P>A few words to respond to the detractors here:<P>- to "beyond the scope of this book" Darren: what the heck did you expect?! You want to use a product in advanced ways, then fault an introductory book for not giving you details on how to do it. I'm a Linux/Apache/Perl guy myself, but the very fact that you insist on talking about Zope in Perl-ish terms shows that you JUST DIDN'T GET IT! Zope is *way* more than just a Python replacement for what we already do. And don't bring the script language wars into this - we're talking about Zope and The Zope Book, not whether Python or Perl is better.<P>- to "glowing review for Zope" wpbarr: what I said to Darren about faulting an introductory volume for lacking advanced details goes double for you. Installing a Zope product may not have been mentioned, but I'll bet it was at least in part because it's so darn easy that it's not worth wasting print space on. You will *not* waste your saved development time figuring it out - the online and included docs are so clear that you'll learn it in about five minutes, if you trouble yourself to try. As for integrating Zope with existing infrastructure, I repeat: this is an *introductory* volume, not an advanced textbook. <P>Summary: Don't expect this book to be what it's not, and you'll find it's very much worthwhile. You can frustrate the heck outta' yourself trying to learn to write a sonnet from a "Dick And Jane" primer, but that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the primer. Ya gotta' start somewhere! ;-)</span>
