                    <span>Most of others microcontroller or microprocessor books I've read only touch a little on the hardware system design, more often just using ideal models. For instance, most books explain how to construct address decoder using 74138, and thats it. That is sufficient if you are only doing computer simulation. However, when you want to design the real thing, fresh engineers would probably wonder, 74LS138, 74HC138 or 74ACT138 to be used? What are the uses of capacitance value, voltage range,timing diagram etc on datasheet? You will find the answers in this book.
<br />
<br />The author use detailed and real example in explaning timing, loading, voltage range, logic families etc. This is the book for fresh graduate who doesnt know where to start, and also for engineers who want to build a realiable circuit.</span>

                    <span>Great book for beginners and for experts. Really easy/enjoyable to read. <p>I think the greatest thing about this book is that it describes quite well how one should interpret eletrical specs of devices. The examples are quite practical and use real spec numbers. A must.</span>

                    <span>This was one of the best technical books I have read in years.  Embedded Controller Hardware Design provides an excellent introduction to the world of embedded controller design.  The author has a writing style that is very readable and he uses sufficient examples to illustrate to the reader how to apply what they have just read .<p>The book primarily deals with the hardware design aspect of controller design, and focuses on the 8051 microcontroller and its variants.  Most of the book is spent developing a systematic method of making sure a design will work reliably, even under the unfavorable conditions of a "worst-case" scenario.  The book would probably be most useful to electrical engineers, electronics technicians, and serious hobbyist who are just getting started in embedded systems and need some good background material.  It could also be useful to programmers who are migrating from the desktop/PC environment to the embedded controller environment and want some information on the structure of embedded hardware.</span>
