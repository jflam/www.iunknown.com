                    <span>For years, this underground fake book was THE book you had to have to survive on any professional straight Jazz bandstand... and it was tough to find, not to mention expensive.   So underground you had to whisper for it at the counter of only the hippest music shops in town and if no one was looking for thirty bucks or so they'd get you a copy... (I'm not joking !) Then it began floating around the net, and for some reason each time the sites would get shut down... and now finally, a "legit" copy is available.   Though perhaps we'll never know the full story of just who exactly wrote it and where he/she/they lived... the fact is that the book (atleast for the time being) is now available... ironically by HAL LEONARD, the publishing company that tended to publish all those other FAKE BOOKS for years that made the REAL BOOK so appreciated (LEONARD's books tend to have great tune selections, but some of the worst changes in the world... in contrast, the REAL BOOK's sheets, though not perfect are usually a safe call when you're called up to blow, also unlike Scher's commercially available THE NEW REAL BOOK they're a lot more practical (i.e. you take one glimpse at the sheet and the form is staring right back at'cha !) - - One more funny ironic point, even if the anonymous author/authors were involved in this project its funny because I guess they'll now be pursuing people who BOOTLEG their books... outlaws joining the system... that's progress for ya !
<br />
<br />All in all, books 1 and 2 are essential purchases (I pray 3 will become available too.)  I actually tend to play more tunes from Book 2 which includes JEANINE, INDIANA, BYE BYE BLACKBIRD, NEARNESS OF YOU, however REAL BOOK I set the standard of what tunes we should play at our sessions.  If there's any fault its the overdependence of musicians on it, to the point that many musicians simply don't learn equally important tunes found outside it (even though it does not include EVERY essential standard, it definitely gives you more than enough to survive...) but the fact is, its must have material... if you don't have it, go out and get it... unless you have a perfect ear and most the tunes already learned and memorized, you can't really call yourself a pro without it and will find yourselves embaressed at most sessions everytime a tune (9 times out of 10 at some sessions) is called from this book !</span>

                    <span>a great recreation of the original (illegal, "underground") Real Book.  the lead sheets have clear, bold notes, and the pages are never crowded.  the tunes are in alphabetical order, and all fit one to a page (or, in the case of longer ones, on facing pages).  essential riffs are written out (like in "Seven Steps to Heaven").  
<br />
<br />good selection of standards, but for every commonly played tune they include, you could name two or three equally well-known tunes that are missing.  this is a pity, as you'd love to make this the only fake book you'll ever need.  </span>

                    <span>The Real Book should set the minimum standard for all fake books. 
<br />
<br /> As a beginner, I was timid about purchasing this book. What a delight to see large clear type, a song for each page or two page songs that face one another.  I even discovered that I could play some songs immediately which was not possible with the same songs in a book such as "This is the Ultimate Fake Book with Over 1200 Songs."  In that book the print was so small that I had to squint constantly to try to read the notes. I bought new glasses.  Even then,  I swore that I would never buy another book published by Hal Leonard.  Well, guess what.  This is a book also published by Hal Leonard.  And it's wonderful.</span>

                    <span>This "sixth edition" is a welcome sight. At this price it's more affordable to musicians, and you don't need to feel like you're buying some pot from the music store by asking for it in hushed tones.
<br />
<br />The differences between this and the bootleg fifth edition Real Book are substantial - many tunes are incompatable between the two, so you cannot mix the books as you could with older editions of the Real Book. But as this new one contains the correct changes and forms (including those notorious missing 4 bars in Desafinado, the correct changes for Dolphin Dance, and the omission of the mystery "turnaround" we've long ignored in the 4th bar of the bridge of Satin Doll) it's really a better book for new players, and will be enlightening to say the least for veteran players who've been playing these songs wrong all these years.
<br />
<br />Not all the songs are here: some, like the Zappa and Sun Ra tunes, obviously were not cleared by the copyright owners; others which never are really played are omitted as well, like "Perfect Love". What replaces them are tunes which are far more useful to the gigging player, classic standards and others which were never in the Real Book but should have been. An internet search will easily turn up the tune list - if you absolutely need the tunes not in there anymore, you're out of luck unless you keep your old copy too.
<br />
<br />I don't think the transposed versions are available at this writing. Of course, if you can transpose that's no bother at all. Hopefully they will be out soon. Once they are, this can truly replace the illegal book at about half the cost and with more useful tunes for the player.</span>
