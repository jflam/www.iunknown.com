                <span id="Label1"><p><br><i>Information Modeling and Relational Databases</i> provides an introduction to ORM (Object Role Modeling)-and much more.  In fact, it's the only book to go beyond introductory coverage and provide all of the in-depth instruction you need to transform knowledge from domain experts into a sound database design.<br><P><br>Inside, ORM authority Terry Halpin blends conceptual information with practical instruction that will let you begin using ORM effectively as soon as possible.  Supported by examples, exercises, and useful background information, his step-by-step approach teaches you to develop a natural-language-based ORM model and then, where needed, abstract ER and UML models from it.  This book will quickly make you proficient in the modeling technique that is proving vital to the development of accurate and efficient databases that best meet real business objectives.<br><br>* The most in-depth coverage of Object Role Modeling available anywhere-written by a pioneer in the development of ORM.<br>* Provides additional coverage of Entity Relationship (ER) modeling and the Unified Modeling Language-all from an ORM perspective.<br>* Intended for anyone with a stake in the accuracy and efficacy of databases: systems analysts, information modelers, database designers and administrators, instructors, managers, and programmers.<br>* Explains and illustrates required concepts from mathematics and set theory.<br>* Via a companion Web site, provides answers to exercises, appendices covering the history of computer generations, subtype matrices, and advanced SQL queries, and links to downloadable ORM tools.</span>

                    <span>The book is like an ocean, poorly organised. No pictorial representations (which I think is very important when we discuss data modeling). I bought this book to refresh my data modeling knowledge-- disappointing. May be useful for some students to clear some papers, for pros - please find something else.

                    <span>I am currently a student of Dr. Halpin at Northface University in Utah. After our first course on modeling in ORM directly from Dr. Halpin I am psyched about the future of DB modeling using ORM. This book along with "Database Modeling with Microsoft Visio for Enterprise Architects" serves as our core course books. Read this book and follow the Exercises and you are getting Halpin's Course minus his sense of humor.<p>His books are informative and easy to read. Even with his instruction close at hand, having this book is a must for any modeler who wants to get anywhere.  He covers ORM, UML, and ER modeling. My preference for ORM when modeling databases or XML schema's is strongly tied to this book. Its easy, its fast, and best of all it makes sense.<p>My first recommendation would be to come check Dr. Halpin out for yourself in Utah @ Northface University. But if you can't, buy his books and seriously follow along. This is the future, this is where the industry is headed, not just for DB's but all applications (just ask anyone at MS or IBM).</span>

                    <span>After having used ER modeling with extreme frustration, I finally decided to investigate something new.  This is the bible for ORM, and ORM is just so far superior to ER for conceptual modeling, which I now realize is critical.<p>Conceptual modeling means modeling your data in a way that makes sense to everyone, from the business experts (who know nothing about databases) to the coders and DBA's.  And ORM provides a logical, intuitive way to do this.<p>Once you've got a conceptual model, it's pretty straightforward to get an ER model, from which you can develop the logical databased design.  In fact, MS Visio (forget which version) does this for you.<p>The reason ER fails is that it cannot model data in a stable way.  It still has a place, but ORM is so much more powerful, scalable, and stable.<p>And not only will you learn about ORM (he has great exercises to help practice), but you will learn a lot about data in general.<p>This is the best technical/developer/software engineering book I have ever read.</span>
