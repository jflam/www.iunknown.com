                    <span>This is the best statistical resource I have seen.  It is comprehensive; you will find just about anything you're looking for in here.  All of the traditional statistics plus many of the analytical stats developed by the Society of American Baseball Research to determine more accurate measures of a players actual impact on winning games.  It also includes a number of interesting articles on the evolution of the game, which anyone with an interest in baseball history will find invaluable.  This reference tool is well worth the price.</span>

                    <span>I wanted to like this edition. John Thorn's article on Barry Bonds was first rate. But, alas, the book self destructs. This banquet for those who love to chow down on finely cooked statistics has crossed the line from being just a paradise for nerds who don't understand the game to becoming a very dangerous book for those who really understand and love the game. What pushed it over the edge is an article entitled "From Babe to Mel... The Top 100 People in Baseball History." Number 40 on the list is none other than that remarkable baseball parasite, Bill James. Yes, John Thorn and company have tried to elevate their useless field of activity to such a level of importance that they actually suggest that one of their partners in crime, Master Deceiver Bill James, is actually one of great men in baseball history. If you really care about baseball this should alarm you. Since so many other people on the list are in the baseball Hall of Fame I can only assume this is Thorn's attempt to elevate these statistic cookers to a level that would merit entry into the very institution that James has annointed himself as gatekeeper. Let me hoist James and company on their own petard. I'll quote from Bill James latest compendium of lies "The New Bill James Historical Abstract." In his article on George Kelly where he continues his vicious attack on Hall of Famers who don't fit into his statistical propaganda plans he says "What put [Kelly] into the Hall of Fame was a Veteran's Committee salted by two of his old teammates, one of his old General Mangagers, and two old reporters who had covered his team in his glory years...I don't think one can denounce that kind of thing in strong enough terms." Well, coming right back at you, Mr. James. That John Thorn and his buddies at Total Baseball, for obivious self serving reasons, contrived a list that attemps to elevate opinionated staticians who don't understand the actual game as it's played on the field to the level of baseball immortality is something one cannont "denounce in strong enough terms." </span>

                    <span>I have read two previous editions of Total Baseball and this 8th edition is the very best.  For all TB readers out there the 8th edition still has complete statisical player guide with the standard statistics  baseball historian tend to expect.  The newest stat added is the Win Shares for each season and carrier.  Anyone would has read Bill James' Historical Baseball abstract is familiar with this stat.  <br>    What makes the 8th ed of TB a better book than all that have come before are the essays on both the historical progession of the game and on hot botton issues.  Essays take on  hot button subjects as the greatest team of all time  (not the '27 Yanks)  and whether Bonds is the greatest ever.   Also included are essays from contemorary SPORT magizines on player profiles. <br>      In short this book is simply the greatest as far as historical reference and as always is the greatest stat guide ever produced.  5 stars +</span>
