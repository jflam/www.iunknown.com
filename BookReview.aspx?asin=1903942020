                    <span>This is a fascinatinating book that is at once interesting as it is beautiful in imagery. The Walters Art Musuem boasts the largest Ethiopin art outside of Ethiopia alongside a permanent collection of Byzantium and Russian art. The Ethiopian collection in the City of Baltimore is only one part of a museum that builds it's strengths on the art of the eastern Orthodox world. The collective authors give a brief but satisfying history of Ethiopia and its significance in the ancient world along the Mediterrenean trade route. There is also an overview of daily life and religious practices, art history and the role of the Cross, illuminated manuscripts and painted icons that rivalved some of the best in the Orthodox world. The written word is essential to understanding the magnificent art that is displayed. If you are interested in icon art you will love this book with it's unique representations. I also found the older wood work to be exceptionally beautiful and intricate in craftsmanship. The results are some of the most beautiful processional crosses you will probabaly ever see. Later these crosses were made to be more permanent using bronze. Probably equally has impressive are the icon painting and hand made illuminated books that were used for ritualistic purposes in Ethiopion culture. The plates in the book come from the museum catalogue and date from the 4th to the 18th century. The religious nature of the works reflect a combination of African roots and Christian influence. Jesus, Mary and all the saints are painted with distinctively non- Western features. It is unfortunate that there is no cover art availbale on this page otherwise you would be able to see the painting of baby Jesus and the Archangels with small afros as he sits in the arms of Mary.Much of the art is uncredited and the artist is lost in antiquity and known only as an annonymous painter. The Christian kingdoms art of Ethiopia gets its deserved recognition alongside the art of Russia and Byzantium in this book. The book features some of the most colorful unique Christian art imagineable. There is also a good bibliography featuring a list of over fifty books for further scholarship. This is the first time this magnificent collection is available in publication and will surely satisfy those interested in icon painting and the art of the Orthodox world.</span>
