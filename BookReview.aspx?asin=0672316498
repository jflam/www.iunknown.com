                <span id="Label1">In this book about the darker side of technology's impact on our lives, Alan Cooper begins by explaining that unlike other devices throughout history, computers have a "meta function:" an unwanted, unforeseen option that users may accidentally invoke with what they thought was a normal keystroke. Cooper details many of these meta functions to explain his central thesis: programmers need to seriously reevaluate the many user-hostile concepts deeply embedded within the software development process.<p>   Rather than provide users with a straightforward set of options, programmers often pile on the bells and whistles and ignore or deprioritize lingering bugs. For the average user, increased functionality is a great burden, adding to the recurrent chorus that plays, "computers are hard, mysterious, unwieldy things." (An average user, Cooper asserts, who <I>doesn't</I> think that way or who has memorized all the esoteric commands and now lords it over others, has simply been desensitized by too many years of badly designed software.)<p>   Cooper's writing style is often overblown, with a pantheon of cutesy terminology (i.e., "dancing bearware") and insider back-patting. (When presenting software to Bill Gates, he reports that Gates replied: "How did you <I>do</I> that?" to which he writes, "I love stumping Bill!") More seriously, he is also unable to see beyond software development's importance--a sin he accuses programmers of throughout the book.<p>   Even with that in mind, the central questions Cooper asks are too important to ignore: Are we making users happier? Are we improving the process by which they get work done? Are we making their work hours more effective?  Cooper looks to programmers, business managers, and what he calls "interaction designers" to question current assumptions and mindsets. Plainly, he asserts that the goal of computer usage should be "not to make anyone feel stupid." Our distance from that goal reinforces the need to rethink entrenched priorities in software planning. <I>--Jennifer Buckendorff</I> </span>

                    <span>Alan Cooper makes the case for goal-directed interactive software design in his provocative book, The Inmates are Running the Asylum. He argues that though it would seem common sense, few software-based computer products are designed with the end-user in mind prior to their construction. Instead, they are all too often feature-laden "dancing bearware" that may impress the inexperienced, but infuriate them as well. Cooper suggests that software engineers are to blame for this phenomenon, identifies several examples of ill-conceived software engineering, and offers design specifications to ameliorate the problem. <P>The real culprits in Cooper's book are the programmers and engineers who design products to work their way as opposed to the best way. Cooper argues that the approach that companies take in creating technological products is backward. They do not consider what customers want first. Rather, they consider what programmers can produce (what's capable) and what business people can sell (what's viable), rather than what customers want and need (what's desirable).<P>Examples abound throughout the book illustrating the frustrating results of such backward engineering. These vary from the tragic to the mundane. The first page of the book details a fatal plane crash which could have been prevented had the pilot's computer been programmed to account for human error in navigational commands. Later in the book, Cooper proposes simplified VCR design that would eliminate universal frustration with programming one's VCR, not to mention eliminate the ubiquitous flashing 12:00! <P>Clearly airplane accidents, if not VCR ineffectuality, concern most people. How can computer manufacturers design the most desirable products to avoid such public danger or distress? Cooper outlines specifications that require goal-directed design and end-user orientation. Software engineers typically design programs to accomplish tasks, e.g. the aforementioned navigational computer was programmed to direct the plane where the pilot commanded it. That was its task. <P>Unfortunately, the pilot commanded it to fly into a granite mountain. Had the computer been goal-directed designed, i.e. programmed to direct the plane where the pilot commands it, given that such directions do not result in a collision, tragedy would have been avoided. The latter case illustrates end-user orientation, for it allows for pilot fatigue, emotion, latitudinal unfamiliarity, or oversight, any of which may occur on a given flight. <P>Cooper's call for goal-directed design and end-user orientation of software-based computer products is compelling and seemingly common sense. Overall the book is well written and includes memorable examples and convincing arguments. One less cogent claim, however, is Cooper's suggestion that technology apologists will play an important part in affecting change toward goal-directed interactive software design. I assert that change must come from within the programming and engineering ranks. Apologists, by definition, are not cohesive or likely to take a stand against that which they're apologizing for. This is like asking an enabler to seek help for an alcoholic. It is not going to happen. The software engineers must lay down their addiction to bells and whistles, tasks and tortuous interfaces, and see through the eyes of the end-user: you, me, and the other 98% of the world with flashing 12:00s on our VCRs.</span>

                    <span>This is a book about Interaction Design. I feel I need to say that right off the bat since the title, "The Inmates are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity," as wordy as it is, doesn't say that. In the preface Cooper explains that the purpose of the book is to make a business case for Interaction Design. Therefore he wrote a book for managers. It's full of wacky metaphors not only in the title, but throughout the book. (Add this to the list of oddly-titled business and management book titles: Who Moved My Cheese? Crossing the Chasm, Swim With the Sharks, and so forth.)<P>I'm not a manager, so I can't say whether this book succeeds in making a persuasive business case for Interaction Design. It was heartening to see validation for my area of expertise in black and white. This is not a book for software engineers to read, though, as Cooper seems to have a real problem with programmers. Where Don Norman blamed bad design on designers in The Psychology of Everyday Things, here Cooper places the blame for bad software products directly on programmers.<P>An Interaction Design book written for Interaction Designers would have included more details about how to create and use Personas and Scenarios (two of Cooper's design techniques), and perhaps some advice on how to gain control and respect on interactive projects. But we don't get that.<P>This isn't quite the book about Interaction Design that Interaction Designers need. It does introduce important ideas and techniques, and does describe, in some detail, the problem of programmer-driven products. But I didn't feel that the solutions were covered well enough.</span>

                    <span>I found myself really getting into Cooper's book as I read it. He's an easy writer to read. He keeps things interesting with all sorts of anecdotes and experiences, and he describes them with tongue planted firmly in cheek. <BR> <BR>That's not to say that he isn't serious about what he has to say... clearly, he is very serious. In describing the difference between a Designer and a Developer, and even in more detail when contrasting a Visual Designer and an Interaction Designer, he makes clear just how important this subject is, and how the differences he is talking about can determine the process by which a piece of software or application comes together, and the success of the final product. His obvious frustrations with the roadblocks to effective user-focused design should be understood by anyone involved in the design process.<BR> <BR>The pinnacle of the book, for me, came in the middle. At the end of Part 3 ("Eating Soup with a Fork" -- great title), he discusses the relationship between humans and technology. He says something so simple that it should have been obvious, but it's really a fairly major shift in perception from what many people think. He talks about the assumption that technology is dehumanizing here:<BR> <BR>"It doesn't require sophisticated tools to dehumanize your fellow humans -- a glance or a kick does it as well. It is not technology that is dehumanizing. It is the technologists, or the processes that technologists use, that create dehumanizing products."<BR> <BR>This is important to what Cooper is trying to say in "Inmates" in so many ways. The theme of the book throughout seemed to be that interaction design is only as friendly, or as UN-friendly, as people make it. Technology only does what we tell it to, as we design and implement its specific functions.<BR> <BR>The real revolution that this implies is the possibility that technology can be made to interact successfully with humans, and that it doesn't have to frustrate or debase the people who try to use it. In fact, as a human creation, technology is as human as we want to make it. As Cooper said in chapter 6, "For users to be happy and effective with software, it must be written in harmony with the demands of human nature."<BR> <BR>But like anything, to make software effectively intereact with humans (i.e. more helpful, more usable, etc.) takes more work... one of the roadblocks. Cooper talks, also, about the established culture of programmers. He defines them as almost a seperate breed of humans, at least as far as their thought process and rationale... "Homo Logicus" as opposed to "Homo Sapiens." He talks about the rift that often appears between them, largely because of the cultural perception (mostly an obsolete view) that software is a solitary occupation, that programmers work in a vacuum and are the sole authors of their work.<BR> <BR>The book makes it clear that the software design process can no longer be one which belongs to a solitary person. The creation of software works better as a collaborative effort than it does as a single-author process. Product planners, interaction designers, usability experts, testers, and yes, programmers all have their part to play, and when it comes together, it can yield great results.<BR> <BR>Cooper's conclusion seems to be that the most fundamental changes to the software industry need to be made to the process. The people who make the software are, by and large, talented at what they do, and willing to change for the better if they can. It is when they are asked to do more than they should be that problems arise. A change to the process will ensure that better, more usable products can be made.<BR> <BR>It seems that most of the people who do the work of making the software in question are willing to change the way they do things, but only need permission to do so. Cooper's take on it, which I agree with, is that it has become not only advisable to move on from the obsolete programming culture we have relied on in the past. If we want to make a change towards more usable products that end-users feel comfortable interacting with, then a change to the process of software creation to a more collaborative effort of interaction design and development becomes an imperative, at the very least.<BR> <BR>Recommended to anyone involved in the software design process. Record it on tape and play it for project managers while they sleep.</span>

                    <span>I work for a large computer company that makes software. This book was instrumental in creating and organizing our human interface engineering department.<P>I don't think you can put a price tag on the amount of damage this book and the attitude it promotes has cost us.<P>On the one hand, the examples presented are insightful and on target; on the other hand, Mr. Cooper is a usability consultant, and his goal is to convince you that you need a usability consultant. My company drank the kool-aid, and has even paid for training services based on his work.<P>Part of convincing you that you need a usability consultant is convincing you that your programmers will be congenitally incapable of doing good UI without one.<P>Now, of course, human interface engineering departments eat that up, since it justifies their existence. Human interface engineering departments are a Good Thing. Having two teams (which must collaborate on producing a product that the market will want) at each others throats, waging political wars and each casually making the assumption that the other is incompetent does not lead to an effective organization. But it is the organization that Mr. Cooper's advice can easily lead to.<P>I can say categorically that our product's user interface is *worse*, not better, as a result of the attitudes Mr. Cooper promotes - not due to inattention, but due to the fact that in many cases were everyone agreed improvement was needed, the mutual animosity between the HIE department and the Development department was so great that the decision ended in a stalemate and nothing was done. We are only now pulling away from that era.<P>Read it warily, if you are thinking about how to set up your organization, and remember that it is written with an agenda that may not be set up to benefit you.</span>

                    <span>It's worth reading this book -- even despite the painful tone he often takes -- just to pick up on the ideas of creating concrete personas and how you use them to develop your product. We do that today at Microsoft (at least in Developer Tools), and it's a highly successful way of not only building a good product, but also in helping hundreds of developers understand why a feature is 'in' or 'out', no matter how much they might like it personally.<P>It's also mentioned quickly, but the idea of how much work customers are willing to do for an amount of benefit can affect your designs for the better as well. Fundamentally, you should add value with no documentation and no setup -- if somebody paid money, they should feel rewarded as soon as they start to use your application. Then, after they want to do new things, you can require more work of them to do it. However, it should never be more work than the benefit that they derive! This is an important lesson that, say, most media player application writers would be advised to learn...<P>Of course, as many other reviewers have pointed out, it might have been nice if he had created some personas for who his readers were. I doubt that any of them would have had a goal of being preached to.</span>
