                    <span>I picked up this book durring a recent trip to San Semion thinking it would be fun to hear all the wild and crazy things that happened in the castle. Well I got that partly, but I enjoyed it more for it's portrayal of early Hollywood. Hearing stories like Davies and Clarke Gable ditching the debut of Gone With The Wind (it was too long) to make prank calls are too good to pass up.<P>On the surface, Davies seems to have a terrific life of parties, fashion, socialites and more than enough money to spare. But then you realize that she didn't particularly like making movies, hobknobbing with world leaders or going places that Mr. Hearst did. She was just a slightly ditzy girl wanting to romp and have a good time. I felt sorry for most of the time and it got a bit depressing. But it's her free spirited nature that makes to book as enjoyable as it is. Although,I must admit to putting it down to read something a bit more substantial a few times.</span>

                    <span>Marion Davies truly was blonde! This book is fun to read because she tells all her stories is a light, "airheady" way. She wasn't a dumb blonde by any means, but she has no problem revealing semi-private and semi-embarrasing things. I enjoy reading about Marion and W.R. and if you are interested in what life was like at San Simeon, this book will not disappoint! The book is also heavily illustrated! It is a funny, lovable story!</span>

                    <span>I love it when I find a book that can make me laugh out loud. This one did/does. I get it out and read it again sometimes when I need a pick-me-up. I can see why "WR" loved her. Her childlike sense of fun, her love of animals, her loyalty to friends, just to name a few. Her loyalty and devotion to "WR" would stand out at a time when he was in dire financial straits. Also, this book is interesting in that it gives us a glimpse of the golden era of Hollywood. There are serious moments in the book, but overall it is light-hearted and amusing. She wasn't really shallow or an air-head. The girl just liked to have fun!</span>

                    <span>This book is a must for anyone who is even remotely interested in Hollywood's Golden Era. Marion Davies was a great actress in the silent era, and continued into the 1930's. She not only gave wonderful parties that were the talk of the town, but she was one of the most generous, giving, loving people of all time. She started her own children's clinic, and gave plenty of money to charities. If she heard that a crew member's father needed an operation, she'd give him the money. That was the type of wonderful person Marion was. This book is definately worth buying!</span>

                    <span>This book was worthwhile only in the sense that it provided an opportunity to learn just how shallow and spoiled Marion Davies was. Her life apparently consisted of endless parties, trips to Europe (with her complaining all the while), and playing viscious pranks on her so called friends. Her fascination with Hitler, hatred of Irish and Southernors didn't help.<P>This book was pretty depressing, but it did make me realize how lucky I am to not have anything to do with people like that!</span>
