                    <span>Speak and Grow Rich is key for any speaker who is serious about the business of speaking. I continue to get revelation each time I refer to it. The author is clearly concerned and interested in the success of everyone who reads it. My career as a speaker would be, at best, mediocre without the valuable insights, suggestions, warnings and techniques shared within. Speak and Grow Rich provides a service to us in the field so we can better serve those we speak to. Buy this book and study it.</span>

                    <span>Are you a great speaker? Do you shine at Toastmasters or when you do a corporate presentation. Do you have a life-story to share or a cause that you believe in enough to want to influence other people with your thoughts? Then you may be a candidate for being a public speaker. Dottie is the BEST. I took her workshop several years ago and within days got my first $$$ speaking engagement. Why speak for free when you can get money for sharing your stories? Don't need the $$$ -- then give it to a charity or start a nonprofit foundation. What's so great is that Dottie and Lillet (her daughter) are in the trenches day after day helping and guiding some of the top speakers in the world create a business, not just a speech. She shows you contracts, forms, and reference material necessary to being an 'infopreneur' in the 21st Century. Attend one of her regional workshops if you wish.  ......</span>
