                    <span>  I enjoyed the book, like any good trip. Below is my own version, not like the book but I aint no Pirsig and I do not apologize for this fact.Enjoy the book, wipe the philosophy from your feet  and then relax with another good book. I'd recommend my autobiography published on Amazon.com  Kind Regards
<br />
<br />It was around 1971/72  that I first discovered an alternative to how to determine if your motorcycle had spark or not. I credit my brother Charles Chadwick with this revelation and I will soon explain. This was in the days of Nixon's Watergate, Hunter S Thompsons prime, Dark Side of the Moon's debut and me learning once again that my brother cared so much about me as to teach me to trust no one.
<br />   I had been riding bikes for awhile and being a child of nine/ten I cant blame myself for being ignorant of the workings of a two stroke internal combustion engine. I knew how the  method of testing for spark if your bike would not start, just take the plug out lay it on the head and kick her over, you see spark you have spark.
<br />Good ole Chuckles ever mindful of my education taught me a shocking method of discovery. 
<br />     This was along time ago so patience please, my bike would not start, I did everything I knew mechanically to diagnose the problem. The bike had gas, the fuel petcock was turned to the on position. I checked for spark...nothing. Chuck came to my rescue and started to work on my bike kick it over and over as if it could be flooded, mumbled a number of ridiculous hypothesis why my bike would not start, then I should have recognized that dreadful glint of discovery in his eyes, he had a solution. "Josh hold onto the plug while I kick it over I need to check something"...Although my last Doctors visit did not indicate I am in imminent peril of going into cardiac arrest  , I learned  from my beloved brother at the tender age of nineish what it must feel like when you hear from the cold distance a paramedic yell CLEAR! A shocking revelation, and a lesson well learned.
<br />    Travel through time abit to 1976 and I am riding in North Carolina with me Da and my brother, we always visited in the summers and Christmas since this was where my grandparents lived. Always a good time and always a good story , if I could only remember them all. This year it was Christmas and me da had the state of the art  Yamaha 1976 360 mono-shock motocross bike. Set him back a pretty penny, I agreed not to go to college so he could indulge himself. The bike was awesome! I being a prime example of neoteny could only ride the bike if someone would start it for me and then I would run along side  it and jump on when I felt I could balance the beast.  The thing was a brute but my god what a blast, I can still can feel the power and glee piled upon glee and...Where was I?...Yea North Carolina, me da, Chuckles (Charlie does not like this nickname, nor do I like being shocked by a live spark plug, paybacks)  were out   riding on  public land, a big sand field really, I dunno, this was 1976 for crying out loud and lawyers/environmentalists  had not gained a foothold on the proper methods to bleed us of our freedom to ride around and have fun. Me da took a break, gassed up his new 360 and then promptly could not start the thing. So being the father of my gene pool he naturally pulled the plug on the bike and laid it on the head to check for spark, which it did indeed have and the bike suddenly fired up, not in the traditional way but in the way when kicked over a bike reeking of gas and set a live spark to it will fire up... I missed all the excitement , the futile efforts of throwing  sand on the burning pyre of sport , the profanity and the facial expressions, National Geographic cover  worthy facial expressions one can imagine. I road back only to find that the nitrogen shock had exploded and it was pretty cool but not worth the price of admission me da assured me.  We drug our bikes  home that Christmas the blackened carcass of the 360 among them and listened to the truckers and the hip crowd with CB's make comments 
<br />  on the two bikes with the charred remains of something...My mom was a good sport , my da did not cry (at least in front of me) and for awhile ole Chuckles and myself had to share our bikes with Da. </span>

                    <span>Having read quite a few reviews of this book I am puzzled as to what certain people are trying to achieve. I have read the book and did enjoy it. What bothers me, is that people review this book as though they would review your basic toaster. Reading is not as cut and dry as many would like to think it is. This book struck a cord with me because of the ideas that are brought up throughout the book. 
<br />
<br />The most important thing that can be noted about the reviews found on Amazon are the clusters of 5 star ratings and 1 star ratings. What this conveys to me is that whether people enjoyed the book or not...it also struck a cord in them. This may not be the warmest story and may not the most factual. The book does however present many intellectual ideas and poses many questions. You may or may not agree with them, nevertheless, the chance is you too will have a strong view (your own view). This, however, is what the learning process is all about. So before you read those 1-star reviews and decide to skip this one, realize that it's one of the essential readings one that will spark intellectual well-being. Chances are you will walk away from this book with the awarness of some very important philisophical issues.
<br />
<br />For all those people who would like to discredit the views of a person with a mental-illness, I would advice that you give this book another shot and try and take in these ideas from an angle that many of us don't get to see everyday.</span>

                    <span>The style is flat and uninteresting; but this is a fascinating quest, in fiction form, about what philosophers have said about Quality.  The search is interwoven with the central character's journey on a motor cycle across the United States, with the landscape symbolizing the quest (e.g. ruminations about the most difficult philosophy while he is in the rarefied air on very high mountains). </span>

                    </div>
                    <span>This book is about what the title says - an inquiry into values. But, that is an understatement. The author, through the main character, questions and challenges you to validate how you do and accomplish things. I have tried not to give away the contents in this review for it is best left to be read.
<br />
<br />The main character is on a yearly vacation and chooses to take a ride down south from his place in Montana. His son accompanies him. As they ride, Phædrus, recollects his past and the path that led him to his current self. He goes over how he viewed doing or accomplishing tasks and how those around him differed. In the process he depends a great deal on his experience with both eastern and western religion and philosophies. His knowledge of the Hindu scriptures, religion and simple but profound truths is particulary gratifying to me (Twat Tham Asi - I urge you to explore this).
<br />
<br />A major part of the book, he spends laying a foundation in defining what he thinks is Quality. By referring to Quality, he in a way, is referring to the Absolute in what one days. A few examples he delineates that come in one's way of looking at or achieving quality - Stuckedness, classic and romantic way of approaching solving a problem, value rigidity. 
<br />
<br />Through his journey, both on the motorcycle and his life (past and present), he walks you into constantly thinking and re-evaluating how you can approach your way of doing. 
<br />
<br />At times, I felt a great deal of self-righteousness in his approach. After all, not everyone is as gifted as a few people on this earth. His choosing his young son as somebody to display his disapproval constantly is particularly bothering and worrisome if you are a loving parent. Ultimately is it a big relief that he realizes the hypocracy and the truth why he needs to get back to his looked-upon self. Life is more about loving and caring than about how you view things, however right you are. 
<br />
<br />The afterward is something you wouldn't expect. I had read this book twenty or so years ago as a young man and all I could remember today was that it was one the very best books I had ever read. Reading it again, just confirms the thought; only now, it certainly had a more profound impact.

                    </div>
                    <span>For me this work seems to fall into the category of books that are more disappointing than they otherwise might have been if they did not have the reputation as a `classic.'  If I had read it without any prior preconceptions I think that I would have just found it occasionally annoying, occasionally interesting - but largely unexceptional.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately though since it is a self-described "modern epic" I was expecting more that self-involved navel-gazing.  Sometimes they really are just directions on how to assemble a rotisserie and not a deep symbol of our modern value system... I mean, common - insert A into slot B... *sigh* (if you haven't read the book before just know that yes this is really part of it, I didn't make it up)
<br />
<br />To give the book its due though the author's unique perspective does give rise to some interesting points and ideas but these worthwhile nuggets are too few and far apart.  Maybe if I was interested in the value of philosophy in and of itself this book would have been of more interest but rather it seems to represent more of a problem that pure philosophy can represent.  When ones goes on these journeys of the mind and allow themselves to become so disconnected from reality there ideas loose all practical value - while a rational proof of something may be occasionally interesting, a more important question might be how one brings these abstractions back to the real world.
<br />
<br />Finally, any book of this type which seeks to expound `the truth' (or even a truth) always walks a fine line between being interesting and coming off sounding aragonite.  This book walks that fine line - and crosses it frequently.
<br />
<br />While I did have to roll my eyes every few pages I am still glad I read this work because of its reputation - sometimes finding out a book isn't that great is just as valuable as finding out that a book is good.</span>
