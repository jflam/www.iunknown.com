                    <span>One look at Martres's two books on photographing the Southwest convinced me to immediately buy his CDs as well. Many of the photos are stunning and Martres's fair use conditions are generous.  The images are good companions to the book as you can copy the good setup angles that he has spent years finding.  Also he avoids overly heavy use of filters so that what you see in the images represents what you may actually see in the field.  There are a few times in which the criteria for including pictures seems to be the success of the shots rather than the significance of the places visited.  (For example, Angel Arch in Canyonlands is not included.)  Also, I found the links that some of the images had to his chosen jpg viewer (included) quirky.  His may be more viewer than you want or need.  Fortunately, it is possible to get around the included viewer and use your own jpg viewer.  On the whole, the CD is very worthwhile.</span>

                    <span>This CD is hyped as a professional quality portfolio of the scenic southwest. While the photos are synchronized with the text of volume 1, which is helpful in visualizing the locations, The quality of the photos is not worth the $19.95. Since I was disappointed, I returned the CD and was reimbursed the sum of $6.95 for my troubles. If you are looking for quality photos, don't waste your time, and money!</span>
