<h3 class="title">One last hurrah</h3>

<p>I'm writing this entry via NewsGator on my desktop PC back home after <span class="caps">VPN</span>'ing to my home network from the wireless access point at the Air Canada Lounge. I'm still amazed at how well all of this technology works.</p>

<p>I'm in for a special treat today. For all of the flying that I've done over the past 7 years, I've never flown on the second floor of a 747. Apparently Air Canada is going to retire its 747 fleet (6 planes) soon. So unless I'm flying on a Pacific flight with some other airline, this might be my last chance to fly on one of these planes.</p>

<p>One other thing. If there are any Air Canada Elite flyers reading this, you should notice that they've changed the requirements on the Aeroplan System Wide certificates - you can now use them on <span class="caps">Y, M, H,</span> and V fares. This is a lot different than last year when you could only use them on Y fares. So if you don't plan on flying to Europe, you can burn these upgrade certificates on North American flights now.</p>

<h3 class="title">Fence</h3>

<p><img src="Files/Fence.jpg" alt="Fence"/></p>

<p>Sometimes great photographs just appear near where you're looking. After I shot the image of the <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/000313.html">Solitary Tree</a>, I turned to my left, and across the highway, this fence was wonderfully lit by the early morning sun. </p>

<p>I have to confess that I don't pay as much attention to depth of field when shooting with digital cameras; my Nikon 5700 has far greater depth of field than a 35mm camera. I shot this image at F/5.3 at ~250mm. If you look closely, the fence at infinity isn't quite in focus, whereas the fence that's nearby is. I have to remind myself to stop down the aperture more when shooting zoom compositions like this one.</p>

<h3 class="title">Solitary Tree at Dawn</h3>

<p><img src="Files/Solitary-Tree.jpg" alt="Solitary Tree at Dawn"/></p>

<p>I would drive past this tree every day on my way to teach my Programming <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> class in Fort Collins a couple of weeks ago. On Thursday morning, I planned to drive up to Rocky Mountain National park to take some photos of alpenglow. I had a problem with my alarm clock's user interface and overslept by an hour. When I awoke, I knew it was too late to make it to the mountains, so I went to visit my favorite tree. </p>

<p>If you look carefully at the photo, you'll see the shadow that falls on the trunk of this tree. The shadow is cast by a nearby tree. I wanted to see the rich morning colors of the sun on the trunk of this tree, but to no avail. If I were to return earlier in the year when the sun rises further to the south, I should capture the light that I wanted to see.</p>

<p>This image was made from a tripod on the edge of a highway. I used a medium telephoto (~150mm) and shot wide open (F4.2). The grass at the bottom edge of the photo was effectively at infinity, so I didn't lose any depth of field by shooting wide open.</p>

<p>It is very hard to tell a good story. If you tell a good story, both you and your audience win. If you tell a bad story, you have just wasted everybody's time. This book is by far the best book that I have ever read on how to tell a story (a.k.a. make an effective presentation). It focuses on how to tell a story to an audience. Specifically, how to motivate your audience (what's in it for them?), how to capture their attention, how to organize your ideas, and how to structure your presentation materials (both text and graphics). </p>

<p>If you give presentations, you <em>need</em> this book. It has totally changed the way I approach writing presentations. </p>

<h3 class="title">Life with Apple hardware</h3>

<p>I actually had to get a bit of work done at the cottage last week. But I did something really dumb before I returned from my visit to HP the week before: I left behind the power adapter for my Thinkpad! Now, that's the quickest way that I can think of to turn your laptop into a useless pile of metal!</p>

<p>I reverted to my "backup" laptop - my <span class="caps">G4 </span>TiBook. Since I was mostly doing writing, I could get by with just Office and Freemind (which runs on Java). I took a bunch of photos as well, so I "developed" them using Photoshop. All in all, it was quite a pleasant experience. I burned the cursor movement keystrokes into my brain by the end of the week, so (at least with Word) I felt quite comfortable using the Mac.</p>

<p>When I passed through Denver, I dropped by the Apple store and bought a shiny new 30GB iPod. My first impressions: the packaging is beautiful and the headphones suck. They literally stopped working within about 2 hours! The amount of distortion was unbelievable. I bought a pair of $9 headphones from Wal-Mart that worked well until I got my Sony NC-11 noise-canceling headphones. I had a pair several years ago before I broke / lost it (long story) but they work extremely well. Thanks to Charlie from my class who ordered it for me (another long story). </p>

<p>I ripped some of my CD's using <span class="caps">MP3 VBR 100</span>% quality. Don't do this. I plan on re-ripping using a high constant bit-rate. The iPod has some strange bugs that cause <span class="caps">VBR MP3</span>'s to stop short of the end of the song. Also, you won't know how long a song is because it can't calculate the length of a <span class="caps">VBR</span> song (strange since MusicMatch doesn't have a problem with this). And one other thing: playlists are everything on portable players with giant capacity. Spend the upfront time to organize your music and you will greatly increase your enjoyment.</p>

<h3 class="title">Back from vacation</h3>

<p>Carolyn and I just got back from a week in the <a href="http://www.discovermuskoka.ca/muskokaismagic/">Muskokas</a>. It was a relaxing week where we (Kobe, Carolyn and I) got a chance to go hiking through the very picturesque countryside. I also got a chance to take a few photographs, and I'll post them here over the next week or so.</p>

<p>Kobe was sitting in front of me on the shore when Carolyn turned around to look back at us. I noticed that she was backlit by some really spectacular light, so setup the tripod and made this image. I used max telephoto and shot wide open (F4.2, ~280mm) so that I could blur out the background. Aside from the really nice light, I really like the fact that you can't tell that Carolyn is 8 months pregnant!</p>

<h3 class="title">No more ND grad filters for me!</h3>

<p>I haven't written about photography in quite some time now, so I thought it I'd write about my weekend experiences today. I'm having a fun time out here in Fort Collins teaching my <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> class to a great bunch of developers. I also had a chance to head out to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/romo/">Rocky Mountain National Park</a> over the weekend to take some photos. </p>

<p>Whenever you take photos in contrasty light situations (like sunrise / sunset) and you want to have some detail of subjects that lie in the shadows, you normally would pull out your graduated neutral density filters to help you out. A grad ND filter is a filter where one part is transparent and the other part is holds back one or more stops worth of light (without changing the color - hence the Neutral Density designation). The idea is that you place the dark part of the filter over the bright part of your photo, thereby allowing you to expose for the darker part of your photo and still be confident that you're not going to overexpose the bright part of your photo.</p>

<p>Using a ND grad filter takes practice, and works quite well in situations where there is a straight line between the bright and the dark portions of your photo (horizon lines and mountain ranges work quite well here). But what happens when you don't have a straight line? This is where you either have to compromise or have strange-looking artifacts in your photo.</p>

<p>Enter bracketed exposures. The idea is that you set your camera to take several photographs in rapid succession (three in my case). My camera, a Nikon Coolpix 5700, lets me set the camera to take three shots at different exposure levels +/- 0.5, +/- 0.7 and +/- 1.0. I can fire off a three photo burst hand-held with excellent results. Next, you recombine these photographs using Photoshop and <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/digital-blending.shtml">the techniques described by Michael Reichmann's excellent tutorial</a> over at his web site, <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com">Luminous Landscape</a>. </p>

<p>I have some really awesome results using the simple Photoshop technique that I don't understand (it involves using Gaussian Blurring and masks). Right now, it's Pure Fantastic Magic, but I can vouch for the results. It's so good to be able to get rid of that nasty Cokin filter holder that I had hanging off of the front of my camera, and to capture several additional stops of light in my photos.</p>

<p>I'll publish my photos once I'm done processing them. I think I have 6 or 7 keepers so far, which is pretty good for me. </p>

<h3 class="title">Force .aspx pages to be compiled during daily build</h3>

<p>I spent the better part of today trying to figure out how to compile .aspx pages <em>without running them</em>. I have a somewhat grotesque hack that uses <code>PageParser.GetCompiledPageInstance()</code>. It works, but only for .aspx pages. I'd love to be able to compile .ascx, .asmx, .ashx, and .asax pages as well. </p>

<p>I host the <span class="caps">ASP.NET</span> runtime in its own AppDomain via <code>System.Web.Hosting.ApplicationHost.CreateApplicationHost()</code>. One of the problems that I ran into was figuring out how to initialize <code>HttpRuntime</code> so that I can call <code>PageParser.GetCompiledPageInstance()</code>. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to initialize <code>HttpRuntime</code> without first running a page via <code>HttpRuntime.ProcessRequest()</code>. I'm not very happy with that as an option.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to get this done would be really helpful. My goal is to write a NAnt task that will let folks include .aspx files in their daily build process.</p>
