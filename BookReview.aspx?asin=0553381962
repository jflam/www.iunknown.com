                <span id="Label1"><b>Mending the Ties That Bind<br><br></b>Divorce; disputes over inheritances, family business, or elder care. Rifts over marriage partners, career choices, or sexual orientation--these are just some of the many ways that even close families can break apart. Yet this all-too-common and often devastating family problem, and its emotional fallout, has gone virtually unaddressed&#8230;until now.<br><br>In this remarkable book, Barbara LeBey, an Atlanta attorney and former judge, who herself suffered and resolved a family estrangement, shares the stories of people from every walk of life and of every age and race, to show how such rifts often begin and how they can usually be resolved. <br><br>Working closely with two family therapists, LeBey offers a set of tested guidelines to help you approach alienated or angry family members, deal with your own issues, and mend your broken family relationships--even if you think it may already be too late.<br>Compassionate, practical, and full of rich insight, this book is a beacon of hope and healing to which families everywhere will turn again and again.</span>

                    <span>I recently had a problem with my daughter. I was very upset and frustrated. I looked at my shelf of self help books. Dr. Phil always tells you to change but doesn't tell you how. He just says DO it. Barbara LeBey gives you real solutions to real problems, and lets you know that things can't always go your way. It was an enormous help to me and my daughter. I would recommend this book to anyone with a family problem. It doesn't have to be enormous, mine wasn't a true estrangement, but small things can grow. Ms. LeBey lets you know that you aren't alone and she gives concrete do-able advice. I have read the other reviews of this book and can't help feeling that a couple of them were written by the author's 'evil' daughter-in-law. Who else would become so angry at the content of this book?</span>

                    <span>The alienation of family members from one another is a common occurrence in life. This estrangement causes a deep seated bitterness and pain that hurts the family and can often continue from one generation to the next. What can we do to heal these family rifts that cause so much chaos?<P> Babara LeBey provides us with an answer in her book, "Family Estrangements". She identifies the source of the problem, offers guidelines in dealing with estrangements and provides us with strategies on how to cope with them. The books covers a wide range of subjects that can cause family rifts such as divorce, sexual orientation, race, and inheritance. Each chapter also shares the stories of people who went through painful estrangements with their own families. They tell us what they learned from their own experiences and offer invaluable insights on coping with the alienation.<P> I thoroughly enjoyed this book which I recommend for family members (dealing with estrangements), ministers and other helping professionals. Barbara LeBey is sensitive in her presentation and doesn't lay "the blame" on any individual as the source of the rift. She enables one to look at the situation, access what is going on and begin the process of healing. Family Estrangements is a practical resource book that can enable you to begin the process of healing the rifts within your family.</span>

                    <span>This author has a clear agenda to paint daughter-in-laws as the masterminds behind many family estrangements. She offers absolutely no scientific research to support her charges. She doesn't examine the possibly that a mother or father in-law could be the cause of a rift and certainly never concludes that a son may WANT to leave his family. No, the DIL is blamed for forcing her husband to take sides with her against his family of origin. <P>Newsflash: Sons will not become estranged from their birth families if the underlying relationship with his parents is overwhelmingly healthy. <P>Newflash #2: Disfunctional people don't generally admit they are flawed. But the author believes without question that the mothers she interview with estranged sons did not contribute at all to the estrangement! Gee, I doubt they'd admit that they were controlling, narcissistic, alcoholic, possessive, jealous, etc. <P>This book is an incredibly self-serving project which may make the author feal like a martyr and give her a big thumbs up for being so brave and so forgiving. Writing a book about estrangements is a wonderful distraction from actually looking inward and reflecting on how the author herself may have contributed to her own pain. Nah, much easier blaming the daughter-in-law and pretending the family of origin was a slice of heaven on earth. No sense looking at one's own faults. Sigh.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Because I face a similar situation, I was particularly interested in the chapter in which Ms. LeBey described her estrangement from her son. <P>What the readers who complain that the book is one sided don't understand is that her daughter-in-law, like mine, has never given a reason for her anger. How can you correct a problem if that problem is not identified? No matter how willing you are to examine your own behavior, it is impossible to do so when your daughter-in-law refuses to explain the reasons for separating you from your son and grandchildren. After many years of trying to establish communication, I finally came to the same conclusions as Ms LeBey did, my daughter-in-law simply wanted full control of my son. I had done nothing to cause the problem and I cannot do anything to remedy it. <P>What makes Ms LeBey's book so special is that she recognizes that there are conflicts that don't fit the normal descriptions. Cutting off a controlling, abusive, or addicted parents is completely understandable, but cutting off your parents, ending what always appeared to be a warm loving relation without explanation is not normal or acceptable.</span>

                    <span>I don't know if a reader of sample pages only is allowed to write a review, but that's all it took for me to see that this author is of no use to someone on the lookout for coping advice in my situation -- the terrific pain that results from finally having to end an abusive family relationship to save my own sanity. Le Bey starts right off by making it clear she sees family estrangements as the "down side" of the 20th century's movement toward individual rights, and characterizes sibling splits as "arguments over who got grandmother's silver."<P>If a writer on this subject wants to be taken seriously, her first few pages had better acknowledge that some people's family relationships, even without beatings or incest, are made hellish by forms of mental cruelty and disordered behavior that would be considered grounds for divorce (and possibly court-ordered therapy) in a marriage situation. I cut off all relations with a relative after years of bearing with such behavior, for the last seven of them insisting fruitlessly that my relative agree to try professional counseling before we met again face to face. This has been indescribably painful, and I am sure I am not the only person who has struggled for years to understand and cope with horrible behavior before deciding to separate from it. (I can only imagine what is endured by relatives of people who repeatedly tax their family relationships with criminal, addictive or similar catastrophe-creating conduct.) <P>I have gotten much comfort from books that help me gain perspective on the causes of the behavior I endured and I can always use advice on how to cope with the experience of having no family. What I don't need is to start reading a book on estrangement that all but accuses me and other "leavers" of being selfish on the first few pages. I hope my estranged family member never gets hold of this book -- I can hear the crows of self-vindication already.</span>
