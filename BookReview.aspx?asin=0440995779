                <span id="Label1">Forced to leave her sunny Caribbean home for the bleak Connecticut Colony, Kit Tyler is filled with trepidation. As they sail up the river to Kit's new home, the teasing and moodiness of a young sailor named Nat doesn't help. Still, her unsinkable spirit soon bobs back up. What this spirited teenager doesn't count on, however, is how her aunt and uncle's stern Puritan community will view her. In the colonies of 1687, a girl who swims, wears silk and satin gowns, and talks back to her elders is not only headstrong, she is in grave danger of being regarded as a witch. When Kit befriends an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, it is more than the ascetics can take: soon Kit is defending her life. Who can she count on as she confronts these angry and suspicious townspeople? <p>  A thoroughly exciting and rewarding Newbery Medal winner and ALA Notable Children's Book, Elizabeth George Speare's <I>The Witch of Blackbird Pond</I> brings this frightening period of witch hysteria to life. Readers will wonder at the power of the mob mentality, and the need for communities in desperate times--even current times--to find a scapegoat. (Ages 9 and older) <I>--Emilie Coulter</I></span>

                    <span>The 1959 Newbery winner and a very enjoyable book.  Kit, or Katherine, raised in then-unconventional, but now more common philosophy of girls being capable and independent-thinking, must establish herself in a new place with more rigid limits for girls and thinking, in this case, a colonial Connecticut town.  Like many Newbery-recognized books, this one has a child orphaned.  When oirphan Kit's grandfather dies in their Barbados home, Kit turns to her aunt and uncle in New England.  With colonial politics becoming volatile and weather and Puritan philosophy dicatating a very different lifestyle than she's used to, Kit's good intentions stir up nothing but controversy.  Fortunately, they also create some bonds which support her through controversies.  Underlying themes of prejudice, witch hunting, slave ownership and class distinction, hard work, and courtship rituals further enhance this pleasant read.  A middle school girl would probably enjoy it a lot.  I would recommend it to a girl at that age, a strong intermediate grade reader, and maybe even into high school.  It wouild be a valuable read-aloud book to an intermediate grade class working on American history in social studies (fifth grade here).</span>

                    <span>I read this book when I was younger and I picked it up again a few months ago and reread it. I thought it was excellent! The story begins when Kit, an orphan girl from Barbados goes to Connecticut. She lives with her stern aunt and uncle there, and eventually becomes friends with her cousins. At first she has a lot of trouble fitting in. She's not used to hard work and living in a cold climate. She can't wear her old clothes either. Then one day she meets the Quaker widow, Hannah, who lives on the marshes. They become friends and soon she meets up with Nat, the son of the captain of the ship she came on.  She winds up going to Hannah's cottage more and more, even though her aunt and uncle have forbade her to because Hannah is thought to be a witch. She becomes friends with Nat and gives secret reading and writing lessons to a neglected little girl. Meanwhile, at home, Kit and her cousins Judith and Mercy are having their own problems. Kit dreams persistantly of going home to Barbados. You sort of have a love triangle with Judith, Mercy and John. Then, a rich young man named William wants to marry Kit. Nat gets caught illuminating William's house with Jack o' lanterns, for obvious reasons to everyone but Kit, and is put in the stocks. It all comes to a head one day when people start accusing Hannah of practising witch-craft on their animals and children. Kit overhears and runs to get Hannah safely away on Nat's ship before the mob burns her house. Later the next day, she is arrested because people think she was the witch's apprentice. How will she escape? Will she see Nat again and mend things between them? And most of all, will she get her happy ending by going back to Barbados, or something much different? Read this book and find out!! It has everything: history, love, intrigue, danger, and lonliness. Go read it now, YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!!</span>

                    <span>The Witch of Blackbird Pond, by Elizabeth George Spear
<br />Review by a Cutchogue East student 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Imagine living on the beautiful, tropical Caribbean island of Barbados. Being the Heiress to your grandfather's sugar cane plantation would mean no work, all play. Life would be great, swimming in the warm waters all day, being free to read one of the many books that your Grandfather owns right? You wouldn't have to clean either, with your many slaves. In most homes in the 1600's, a 16 year old would be expected to perform many tasks like cleaning, sewing, and cooking. This is how Kit Tyler's life was, perfect
<br />Never in her life did Kit have to do backbreaking work. She would soon find out what it was like on the other side. Due to an unfortunate situation, Kit is forced to leave her home on the Dolphin, and head toward her aunt Rachel and uncle Mathew's home in Connecticut. Kit, and her cousins Marcy and Judith work all day, doing the work that Kit considered slave's work.
<br />Everything Kit did was the wrong thing in this house. She was even stirring the soap wrong! She was forbidden to help a sweet old widow named Hanna Tupper with anything because the woman was a Quaker. Kit had gone to see her anyway. Because of this she was accused of being a witch. Hanna Tupper was also accused of witchcraft, but Kit managed to help her get away from the angry mob. Hanna's home was burnt to the ground, so she went to live with the mother of Kit's friend Nat.   
<br />For anyone that's wondering why this Book is called The Witch of Blackbird Pond, it's because Hanna Tupper lived at the edge of a pond, Blackbird pond. In my opinion, this is a great book. If you like realistic fiction books, or books that take place long ago, than you will love this book too.
