                    <span>A few years ago I was trying to make a couple of short films and was thus foraging around for money. There was a certain book that was recommended to me more than any other: SHAKING THE MONEY TREE. This book, unfortunately, was out of print. And the copies in the library had been stolen. Written by one of the foremost advisors to indie filmmakers seeking budgets, Morrie Warshawski, the first edition had become a sought-after tome of strategies and funding sources for those itching to follow in the footsteps of Spike Lee or Richard Linklater. <P>Now comes the 2nd edition from publisher Michael Wiese Productions. SHAKING THE MONEY TREE may be lean on lists of sources, but it's rich with strategies on how to raise funds. Which is really what filmmakers need. After all, the lists are easy to come by since the astonishing rise of the Internet, a rise that occurred entirely in the 10 year span of time between the first and second editions of SHAKING THE MONEY TREE. Warshawski notes in the forward that whereas he had literally no mention of the internet in his first edition, he declares is an essential ingredient in the second.<P>As I mentioned, Warshawski keeps the focus of his book not on exhaustive lists of foundations, but what most indie filmmakers really need: improving their skills at organizing your fundraising and-most important-the one-on-one ask for cash.<P>Your average filmmaker won't mind sitting through a mind-numbingly pretentious new film because the famous director is present and the filmmaker might get to say two words to this famous person, but that same filmmaker will shun the opportunity to sit down with a wealthy friend or relative for twenty minutes and actually ASK for money.<P>The strange mix of timidity and entitlement that drives a filmmaker into his or her creative endeavors is the same mix that makes him believe "They should just GIVE me the money." Warshawski's book dispels those absurd dreams and sets the filmmaker on the track of raising money through persistent hard work. <P>Warshawski, a long time consultant on documentaries and narrative films, breaks down the various processes of fundraising by individuals, corporations, foundation, government grants, small businesses and non-profits. He gives different strategies for documentary filmmakers, for animators, for narrative filmmakers and for experimental film and video artists. He includes resources, such as a sample letter for fundraising written by a celebrity, a successful grant proposal and budget form for the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a list of other helpful books and websites that will lead a filmmaker to direct funding sources. But the strength of SHAKING THE MONEY TREE is the way Warshawski educates the reader about how to think about fundraising. <P>After reading the book, the filmmaker can stop being nervous around the face-to-face ask and instead begin role-playing and working his inevitable pitch into the best pitch it can be.</span>
