                    <span>"Unfortunately the relationship of mathematics to the study of nature is not presented in our dry and technique-soaked textbooks", says Kline in his preface. This is his starting point for presenting mathematics as a product of scientific endeavour. The book covers a whole lot of classical mathematics and physics. It is extremely readable, with lots of pleasant discussions of both the actual mathematics and the history behind it. The prerequisites are virtually none. I would recommend this book to high school students who wish to understand the real reasons why, quoting from the preface again, "cold symbols and formulas" have come to be "regarded as of supreme importance in human thought".</span>

                    <span>This work is an excellent reference for the history of<br>mathematics. It begins describing some ancient numbering<br>systems. i.e. The Hindus utilized negative numbers. There was<br>an evolution in geometry. The development and refinement of<br>curves were set forth into equations.  Newton's laws were<br>formulated . i.e. F= MA<br>The motion of projectiles evolved into the use of the sine and<br>cosine to describe curvilinear motion. The laws of gravity,<br>motion and oscillations were refined further into a multiplicity of uses in mathematics and theoretical physics. Many of the fundamental<br>laws and processes of the earlier mathematics have evolved into<br>important applications in theoretical and practical engineering.<br>Examples are Newton's Laws, the Bernoulli equations and a host<br>of other scientific achievements.</span>

                    <span>What a journey!  This book will never age with time.  A must read for those interested in the humanistic value of a subject concider cold and forbiding by some who are disallusioned about what mathematics really is and its purpose in the history of mankind.  A book that could only have been written by Morris Kline,an educator who saw the beauty of the subject. I can say no more.</span>

                    <span>This book is geared to the general reader who has a cursory knowledge of mathematics.  The chapters are organized around physical phenomena and the math behind their explanation.  The result is a charming and VERY useful book.  I have the 1970 edition which is quite worn from frequent use.  The chapter titled, Differential Equations - The Heart Of Analysis, is exceptionally beautiful and pertinent.  Reading this book is akin to a treasure hunt.  There is page after page of mathematical discovery.  Reading the chapter on  Motion Of Projectiles  made me terribly angry at the banal way in which this topic is handled in high school texts.  Things such as quadratic equations and the law of gravitation are explained very well.  I sincerely believe that this book should be a required text for High School math students.  Highly recommended.  The Dover edition is very affordable so even if it means foregoing a meal, do it.  Buy this book!  Well worth your time.</span>

                    <span>Kline's book is a surprisingly accessible history of math, equations and all. It's a perfect balance for those who know their history and want to know more about the math behind scientific ideas, and those who know their  math and want to delve into the practical applications of mathematical  ideas.<p>I loved the examination of how Eratosthenes calculated the  circumference of the earth pretty accurately for a guy without so much as a  telescope. I had terrific "aha" experiences reading the book, and  the students I tutor in math are getting a bunch of interesting background  stories with their algebra lessons.<p>Galileo's and Newton's calculations  are a great way for the theoretically inclined to get their feet wet in  physics. For all of us mathematicians who actually thought math developed  in a vacuum, this book has excellent examples of how inextricably linked  math, science and history are.</span>
