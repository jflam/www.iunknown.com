                    <span>Ruiz Zafón has created a near-perfect novel: seductive and intriguing characters, a brilliant Spanish locale, and a lyrical style reminiscent of past literary masters. I found myself reading passages countless times just to savor the words. The language was so solid and mesmerizing, I could not believe it was a translation. The story lingers in your mind hours and days after reading it, and I become nostalgic; wishing I could read it again for the first time. <P>When Daniel Sempere first enters the labrythine "Cemetary of Forgotten Books", he does not know that this single episode will change his life forever. Daniel discovers a novel entitled "Shadow of the Wind" and makes it his mission to find other books by its enigmatic author, Julian Carax. When he learns that Carax's novels have been systematically destroyed by an elusive stranger, Daniel must protect his volume from the flames. The more Daniel learns about Carax, the more he realizes the similarities and parallels between his own life and that of the author. <P>Allot a good amount of time for this book, you will not be able to put it down.</span>

                    <span>The enthusiastic praise and adulation which critics have accorded the english publication of Carlo Ruiz Zafon's first novel, "The Shadow of the Wind", may trouble the reader who begins the book, worried that little might match his expectations. After all, reviewers who compare a writer's work to a combination of Umberto Eco, or Jorge Luis Borges, or Gabriel Garcia Marquez, or other literary giants, compel the reader to expect to be transported when they open the book.<P>Not to worry.<P>Once started, the single downside for the reader will be knowing that the experience must end. The plot is quite complex, the jacket cover's synopsis will give the reader all he needs to know. The important thing is to read it slowly and carefully.<P>A mystery story, a fairy tale, a love story (actually several love stories), a passion for literature, a treatise on politics, a bawdy tale, with love, hate, courage, intrigue, loss of innocence, humor, cowardice, villainy, cruelty, compassion, regret, murder, incest, redemption, and more. Add to this delicious mixture characters who come alive, and whose thoughts and feelings you will feel deeply.<P>What a great pleasure to discover; an extraordinary first work, one which towers over the endless and repetative volumes which inhabit today's "Best Seller" lists. Read it, and become hypnotized.<P>Edward Jawer<BR>Wyncote, Pa.<BR>ejawer@comcast.net</span>

                    <span>This has got to be with out a doubt, one of the best books that I have read. If you can read the book in Spanish, even if you must strugle a bit, better yet! Zafon simply takes the language of Cervantes and uses it as a brush with which to paint this wonderful and intriguing story of a father and son in 1940's Barcelona. This is a must book to read and treasure. It holds its own with the great ones.</span>

                    <span>I just finished reading this wonderful, beautiful book and I had to sit down and share my feelings about it, so anyone thinking of reading this book won't wait.<BR>I won't go into the details of the story, since that is already done in the Amazon description. I will tell you that The Shadow of the Wind is one of the best books I have ever read. I read a lot of books, sometimes 2 to 3 a week, so when I say it is one of the best I have ever read, it is really saying something. I had already told someone they could borrow it when I was finished, now I am sitting here trying to figure out how to back out of that promise, I don't want it leaving my hands!!!<BR>So do what I did, read this book quickly because once you start, you will have no choice. Then go back and start over, read it slowly and enjoy the writing, the story and the total experience. Bravo Mr. Carlos Ruiz Zafon.</span>

                    <span>A book that seems like it was waiting for you since before you were born. A brilliant conception, masterfull execution, with a translation that is simply a blessing. Fermín is a character both from the ages and for the ages. <P>Certainly better than any book by Arturo Perez-Reverte, whose books I have enjoyed.</span>
