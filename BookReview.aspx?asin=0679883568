                <span id="Label1">This book contains prescriptions for wisdom written by the good doctor himself: "A person's a person, no matter how small." and  "UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not." In his remarkablely perceptive trademark style, America's favorite doctor takes on everything from aging to activism, popovers to green eggs and ham, belief in others to belief in yourself. Irreverent and refreshing, here's a book no self-respecting Seussophile should be without!</span>

                    <span>A nice little compilation of some Dr. Seuss quotes. <P>A nice but small stocking-stuffer for a small price. Some office gift exchanges limit gifts to mercifully small amounts and this is a good option for such an occaission.<P>Only negative is that it's a bit too short; but I must admit I'm still very glad I got it.<P>My favorite quote from Suess (which I would have missed entirely had it not been for this book): "I still climb Mount Everest just as often as I used to. I play polo just as often as I used to. But to walk down to the hardware store I find a little bit more difficult."</span>

                    <span>Dr. Seuss was a man who could stretch out a set of simple words to delight and entertain his audience. But at the same time, his books also held a deeper meaning on important issues: The Lorax and the Butter Battle Book come to mind. <P>This slim tome is full of little pieces of wisdom, in Seuss' own words and with his drawings. It's Suess-Lite, but perfect for when you just need a smile, or a breather. Sometimes the simplicity lets us look at our selves better and to see the simple truths in living. It is a perfect little gift for the graduate, or just to keep on your desk for when you need a smile, and a short breather to put life in perspective.</span>

                    <span>This is not a critique of Dr. Seuss, nor a bash of his works... BUT... REALLY... It's almost like the few pages of this tiny book get lost between the covers. You can read and digest what little has been printed in this book in less than 2 minutes(even if you're not the fastest reader!). Considering the wealth of writings of Dr. Seuss, please don't waste your time with this pitiful excuse for a publication. Just buy the books... you'll get a LOT more bang for your buck!</span>

                    <span>I grew up with Dr Seuss and enjoyed the words and pictures . What a delight to discover as an adult that the words have even more meaning.</span>

                    <span>I'm giving this book to 10 middle managers - while initially they'll probably think it's childish, once they read it they will understand why they received it. Seuss gives us all a simplified view of life and applying the basics to home and work. I also highly recommend everyone read "Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Wisdom" by Taro Gold.</span>
