                <span id="Label1">Finally someone has written a book on animating in Flash. It's a wonder there aren't more like it. <I>Flash 5 Cartooning</I> covers the cartoon production cycle from a Flash artist's standpoint--drawing, writing, storyboarding, animating, and keyframes. Sounds like a book on traditional animation, doesn't it? But everything is examined from a Flash perspective. When the book talks about drawing, it means drawing with a tablet. When it talks on keyframes and in-betweens, it is within Flash and not on paper that these issues are covered.<p>  The book has two outstanding features: first, it's about making cartoons, not Flash. It just so happens that the tool of choice is Flash and the mode of distribution is the Web. Topics like scripting (writing a cartoon story, not computer scripting), storyboarding, layout, camera moves, and basic animation technique are well covered, as well as the Flash interface, how Flash works, how to compress media for faster downloading, basic HTML, and other Flash- and Web-specific topics.<p>  The second great feature is the CD-ROM, which includes samples and material used in the chapters, but above all contains a digital version of the book. Not a stripped-down, bare-bones text version, but a full-color, searchable version. Having a material like this at one's fingertips on CD-ROM raises its usability rating through the roof.<p>  Written in a clear, concise, and lighthearted voice, the book spans 15 chapters. Every page has a handful of screen shots, and every page is in full color. There were no shortcuts taken in either content or production value.<p>  It's remarkable that there aren't more books like this. Sure, Flash is a great tool for all kinds of dynamic graphics and interactivity, but the Flash cartoon sites get a disproportionately high number of hits. Flash cartoons download fast, are often wonderfully creative, and in most cases carry a strong sense of the artist who created them. This is what Flash and the Web have created--a venue for independent animators. Maybe cartoons still aren't taken seriously and that's why so little has been published on the topic; regardless, <I>Flash 5 Cartooning</I> excels in its class, not because the genre is so nichey, but because it is simply a terrific book. <I>--Mike Caputo</I> </span>

                    <span>Want to be a Flash Cartoonist?
<br />Walk, no run and grab a copy of "The Art of Cartooning with Flash" by Daniel Gray, "Flash 5 Cartooning" by Mark Clarkson, "The Big Book of Cartooning" by Bruce Blitz and a flatbed scanner.
<br />In my opinion you need all three books in order to be successful with cartooning in flash.
<br />"The Big Book of Cartooning" isn't a flash book but will teach you how to draw or improve your drawing skills.
<br />I also recommend getting all of these books from the Amazon.com used book marketplace in order to get more bang for your buck.  Once you have a grip on Flash Cartooning, you may want to start creating some flash games.
<br />
<br />You must also have a few simple items to create your cartoons: paper, pencil, papermate felt tip pen and scanner, graphics tablet or mouse.
<br />I draw my cartoon characters using paper and pencil so I prefer to use a scanner instead of a mouse or graphics tablet.
<br />
<br />These books have taught me a lot and are a lot less expensive than going to animation school, flash cartoon workshops, buying how to cartoon in flash tutorials online or buying how to use flash tutorials on cdrom. I also have the following books:
<br />"Dreamweaver MX / Fireworks MX Savvy" and "Flash MX Savvy".
<br />
<br />10/5/04 - Update
<br />"The Art of Cartooning With Flash" includes several transitions that "Flash 5 Cartooning" doesn't.
<br />Transitions are a must in your cartoons!
<br />
<br />10/7/04 - Update
<br />"The Art of Cartooning With Flash" is for advanced users and "Flash 5 Cartooning" is for beginners.
<br />
<br />10/13/04 - Update
<br />I have purchased several flash cartooning books. In my opinion "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" covers everything you need to know about creating cartoons with flash except lip syncing.
<br />The principals of animation, walk cycles, grouping symbols and how to create a flash cartoon from start to finish are covered in the "Art of Cartooning With Flash" also.
<br />
<br />2/7/05 - Update
<br />I just purchased "Macromedia Flash 5 ActionScript for Fun and Games" for $4.  I can't wait to start bring my cartoon characters to life with games.
<br />I'm using Flash MX but the Flash 5 actionsript code will still work with this version of flash.
<br />I didn't want to pay $30 for a how to create games using flash book since creating games won't be my primary goal when using flash.
<br />
<br />2/16/05 - Update
<br />I just purchased "Flash 5 Bible" for $2.46. It has a small section on cartoon animation.
<br />
<br />3/18/05 - Update
<br />I was deciding on whether to purchase one of two traditional animation books.
<br />"Cartoon Animation (The Collector's Series)" by Preston Blair or "The Animator's Workbook" by Tony Blair.
<br />Since I'm concerned with digital computer animation, I'm just going to use "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" and "Flash 5 Cartooning" only.
<br />Also, since "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" discusses the 12 principles of animation, I should be ok without a traditional animation book.
<br />Again, I believe that you need both "The Art of Cartooning With Flash" and "Flash 5 Cartooning" to be successful with flash cartooning.
<br />Note: I still haven't created my 2nd flash cartoon yet.  I made one in 1999, but it wasn't that great.  So, I don't count that one.</span>

                    <span>This book is great for begginners i loved it.  I had just gotten flash to play around with for fun and i did some online tutorials but they only taught me the very basics (like drawing and keyframes with motion tweening). It was a start.  After reading this book i would consider myself a mediocre flasher.  I can make reat movies now.  Now that i have learned this i am moving on to actionscripting which is the only thing this book lacks.  But all-in-all this is a great book and i still use it every now and then for reference.</span>

                    <span>Clarkson's book on Flash 5 for animating offers a great foundation for animators who want to learn Flash.  Probably not the best book for those interested in other aspects handled by Flash, like Web Design, but the title says it all.  Well-paced and easy to digest, his book also goes easy on the tech-speak that loses most casual learners.  All in all, a good start.</span>

                    <span>I'm sorry but I didn't achieve the goal for my cartoon with this book. I get frustrated easliy and this book being a partial culprit. Sure, I learned a little actionscript. But I recommend the Flash Animator over this one. The CD gave me the urls to some cool sites and some cartoons to watch other than that this book isn't of much use to a flash animators, particularly beginners.</span>

It's written in a lively, entertaining manner and Mark Clarkson manages to describe difficult procedures in terms even those new to Flash can understand.</span>
