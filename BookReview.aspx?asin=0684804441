                <span id="Label1">Returning from a Kenyan safari in 1932, Ernest Hemingway quickly devised a literary trophy to add to his stash of buffalo hides and rhino horns. To this day,  <I>Green Hills of Africa</I> seems an almost perverse paean to the thrills of bloodshed, in which the author cuts one notch after another in his gun barrel and declares, "I did not mind killing anything." Four years later, however, Hemingway came up with a more accomplished spin on his African experiences--a pair of them, in fact, which he collected with eight other tales in <I>The Snows of Kilimanjaro</I>. The title story is a meditation on corruption and mortality, two subjects that were already beginning to preoccupy the 37-year-old author. As the protagonist perishes of gangrene out in the bush, he recognizes his own failure of nerve as a writer:  <blockquote>Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well. Well, he would not have to fail at trying to write them either. Maybe you could never write them, and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting. Well he would never know, now.</blockquote>  In the story, at least, the hero gets some points for stoic acceptance, as well as an epiphanic vision of Kilimanjaro's summit, "wide as all the world, great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun." (The movie version is another matter: Gregory Peck makes it back to the hospital, loses a leg, and is a better person for it.) But Hemingway's <I>other</I> great white hunter, in "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber," is granted a less dignified exit. This time the issue is cowardice, another of Papa's bugaboos: poor Francis is too wimpy to face down a wounded lion, let alone satisfy his treacherous wife in bed. Yet he does manage a last-minute triumph before dying--an absolute assertion of courage--which makes the title a hair less ironic than it initially seems. No wonder these are two of the highest-caliber (so to speak) tales in the Hemingway canon.  <I>--Bob Brandeis</I></span>

                    <span>"The Snows of Kilimanjaro" contains some of Hemingway's finer short stories. And like many of his works, they resemble his life. Everything from his childhood to his later years in Africa are material for these tales. The stories of Hemingway's recurrent character, Nick Adams, who some say is Hemingway himself, are contained in this book also. All the works bear his distinct imprint, even though many are under ten pages in length. "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber" is what I consider Hemingway's most potent short story of all. This collection is a great primer for those who are unacquainted with Hemingway's work and wish to discover his talent.</span>

                    <span>This collection of short fiction is a reminder of Ernest Hemingway's place as one of the best authors of all time. The Snows of Kilimanjaro is full of Hemingway's wonderful, clear and timeless language and prose. "A Clean, Well-Lighted Place," "A Day's Wait," and "The Killers" possess profound sadness and sentimentality. My favorite story is the semiautobiographical "Fathers and Sons." Hemingway illustrates his feelings about his father's suicide with rich, albeit sharp, prose. The subject title is also a wonderful story. This isn't Hemingway's best work, not as powerful as The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms, but it's a memorable book nevertheless. His short stories have always touched me, and these aren't the exception.</span>

                    <span>The editors at Scribners have chosen ten of Hemingway's short stories for this Paperback edition. Set both in America and<BR>abroad, the subjects of these tales deal with some of his favorite--albeit morbid--literary interests: death, drink, war and illness. Possibly influenced by Anderson's anthology, WINESBURG OHIO, the author actually chooses one character, Nick Adams, to appear in several unrelated stories. Ranging in length from 3 - 33 pages these stories are the offspring of the imagination and morality of a Man's author. His protagonists include a solider, boxer, gambler, game hunters--even simple waiters. Set in Africa, Italy, France and the Chicago environs, this collection will transport readers back to the era of the Lost Generation, when personal choices were often painfully wrong, resulting in social and moral disaster. Vintage Heminway, with subtle hints of his interest in suicide.</span>

                    <span>A Review on The Old man and the sea<P>The Old Man and the Sea, a story that pursues persistence and determination, but also a book which I think should have won the Pulitzer Prize. I don't think the book is deserving of the Pulitzer Prize because the story confuses readers by going back and forth from Santiago's past and his present. For example Santiago reflects on his past, dream wise and as for as how he used to be or what he used to like. Santiago always goes back in time in his mind and talks about how he used to be. He talks about how he "used" to dream about women, but "presently" he dreams of lions instead. <BR>Likewise he also says how turtle hunting used to be and talks about his three day arm wrestle with the African American man. He compares, later on his turtle hunting and how it used to be and how different it is now. He talks of his past strength and emphasizes how old and weak he is now.<BR>In conclusion, that explains how some readers may get confused or lost in Santiago's past and present since he is always reflecting on or comparing them. I'm not sure if I would recommend this book to someone, it depends if the person likes a book that is very detailed and repetitive. For example, a repetitive part of the book is when Santiago keeps wishing that the boy was there with him to help him fish. Whenever he doesn't he think he can do something or if he gets exited about something in specific, he wishes that the boy was there with him. I think there are too many examples of both very detailed and repetitive parts in the story. <BR>Another important thing is that some of the sentences are very detailed and clocklike. An example of the book being detailed is when he goes into detail about certain things such as his personal life and his worries and him using big words to explain small things such as "treachery". I think that the author (Ernest Hemmingway) could of made things a little more simple and understandable for readers. <BR> Concluding, the old man and the sea is a story that pursues persistence and determination but also a book that, I think should not have deserved to win the Pulitzer Prize.</span>

                    <span>Yes of course, Hemingway is a good writer and some of the stories in the book are excellent. However, as a collection, the book is uninspiring and a bit depressing. Choose a different Hemingway book if you need something to read on safari.</span>
