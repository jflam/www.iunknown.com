                <span id="Label1">The first time Maricel Presilla tasted cocoa from her grandmother's farm in eastern Cuba, she expected the papaya-looking fruit to be full of Hershey kisses. Instead she saw lumpy, tan-colored seeds in a sticky, sweet-tart ivory pulp that reminded her of lychees, and it didn't even smell like chocolate. In <I>The New Taste of Chocolate</I>, Presilla follows the life of a cocoa pod from a sapling through harvest, fermentation, roasting, and production to arrive at what we all recognize as chocolate. Formally trained in cultural anthropology, Presilla relates the history of chocolate from even before the Aztecs. With attention to detail, she gives an overview of cocoa plantations and their farming practices and the different strains of true cocoa, <I>Theobroma cacao</I>. About two dozen unusual, interesting recipes follow, each by a different chef or pastry chef. Wayne Brachman's Pecan-Guaranda Chocolate Tart with Mango and Papaya reminds us of cocoa's tropical roots, while Pierre Herm&eacute;'s Chocolate Croquettes with Coconut, Pistachio, and Pearl Tapioca Sauce are pure elegance. You'll never look at chocolate the same way again. <I>--Leora Y. Bloom</I></span>

                    <span>The first chapter is a view of chocolate from both a historical and botanical perspective.  The next chapter traces the complete life cycle of chocolate, from seedling, to mature tree, fruit, harvest, drying, fermentation, shipment, factory processing, and transformation into chocolate bars.  The third chapter concentrates on the diversity of different cacao tree varieties, from criollo, to forasteros, to trinitarios.  The last chapter is a collection of recipes that were developed for specified brands of chocolate.<p>The main strength of this book is that it teaches the chocolate lover that it really does matter about the cacao beans, just as it matters with coffee beans or wine grapes.  Where was it grown? What variety is it? How was the fermentation and drying handled? Was it shipped properly? What types of beans were blended? What does the final product taste like? Is it high quality or just another mass-produced blend?<p>The flavor of chocolate varies all over the place, and one must know about the cacao beans it was produced from.  This book makes a strong case for the opinion that if the consumer does not demand better quality chocolate, the great producers of the world will not give it to them. I learned that the expensive "boutique" brands of chocolate (E Guittard and Scharffenberger to name only 2 local such companies) really are worth the extra money.  If nothing else, this book should raise the awareness of the chocoholic of the quality of the chocolate.  The good news is that the chocolate companies really are capable of producing superior quality chocolate if the consumer demands it.  <p>On the whole, this book is a mixed lot.  It will inspire you to try all of the new, expensive "boutique" brands of chocolates.  The recipes are intriguing in concept, but rather ordinary; only a couple of the Mexican-inspired hot chocolates are of interest.  The most important part of this book is the list of resources listed in the back where you can learn about and buy all these chocolates.  Also listed are books, classes, and websites that are very valuable sources of information.  <p>On the other hand, once you finish reading the book, it will then become just another coffee table book. You will not be tempted to open this book again, except maybe to get that special website for that special brand of chocolate that you cannot find in the grocery store.</span>

                    <span>While the recounting of the history of chocolate along with a complete step-by-step perusal of the journey from bean to bar may offer compelling enough reason to purchase this book, I think the chapters on tasting the different qualities of that sinful commodity even more coersive.  Anyone who likes to use chocolate in their culinary creations, may find the variety of finer qualities of couverture daunting.  Which to use when whipping up a delicate mousse or a flourless liquid center cake? What spices compliment and which deterioriate? Never fear--the author diligently answers all such queries by recounting a tasting procedure which explains color, flavor characterizations, desirable and undesirable aromas and texture to well-educate your palate while insuring your choice of a specific chocolate to fit your expectations.<br>In addition, some twenty recipes are included to showcase the wide ranging possibilities of this food of the gods.  From truffles to sachertorte, you cannot want for a more delicious palette of ideas to enhance your taste buds.<br>The layout of the book is unsurpassed; the photos are as luscious as the subject, making it the perfect gift<br>Recommended to all those who enjoy discovering new things about things you already love.<br>Also recommended to compliment this book is the novel "The Discovery of Chocolate", which traces the history of chocolate from discovering its Aztec roots to the production of Hershey's chocolate bars as seen through the eyes of a miraculously slow-aging Spaniard of the 15th century. Delicious descriptions of sumptious chocolate creations abound.  Have a homemade hot chocolate ready to sip and savor while you read.</span>

                    <span>This brilliant, beautiful and unique book is a must-have and a must-give; there is no one who would not love it. <br>The author brings a connoiseur's knowledge to the different varieties of chocolate, the  fascinating origin and history of its cultivation, its conquest ofthe European palate, and a detailed explanation of its use in cooking in ways that are authentic, innovative and exciting. <br>"The new taste of chocolate" is the perfect gift - give it next time instead of flowers, a bottle of wine or -- a box of chocolate. You will be remembered forever. Dita Formell</span>
