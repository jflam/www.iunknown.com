                    <span>Written by former presidential speechwriter, Peggy Noonan, On Speaking Well will teach you how to write and deliver effective speeches. Although much can be learned from this book, I hesitate to recommend it to political neophytes, because Noonan's fallback theory on politics is that you should just "be yourself." Obviously I agree -- who wants to vote for a phony? But inexperienced readers might misconstrue this to mean they don't have to study how to win -- and that would be a shame for them. As Mrs. Noonan points out, even President Reagan made it a point to spend time learning how to be a "Great Communicator."

                    <span>I couldn't beleive how bad this book is.  Not really a presentation on how to speak well, but full of recollections of her career-long speaking days.  There was nothing useful in this book, except if you want to hear her reflections on talking her grades up with the professors in college back in the '60's.  A complete waste of time and money.</span>

                    <span>I loved reading this book - Ms. Noonan kept the momentum flowing.  This is a very good introduction for people who are nervous about public speaking and/or speech writing.  Ms. Noonan gives some insights and "how to's" about a person and/or topic.  We must learn about what works for a person and what will not.  Some of this is not earth shattering, however we can enhance our knowledge through her real life examples.  Peggy points out that we should develop our own style, and we should avoid imitating other people's styles.  Ms. Noonan also recommends that we use of humor in the right situations, never speak in a style above us, and avoid industry jargon.<p>I frequently give seminars for my company, and I am a president of a non-profit group.  I found the ideas and suggestions extremely useful in enhancing my presentation skills.  <p>There are a lot of Ronald Reagan examples/case studies, which I enjoyed because I am a huge Reagan fan.  To me this was an added bonus.</span>

                    <span>What I loved best about Peggy's book is the delightful conversational style in which she writes which makes for an entertaining "how-to" read. I learned as much about people and history as I did about speech writing. Who says learning has to be dry or boring? A great book to expand a liberal arts education and improve your writing skills.</span>

                    <span>If you're a speech writer or a person who is often called upon to speak in public, you'll find this slim volume full of nice advice. I liked best the sections that featured passages from some of the memorable speeches Ms. Noonan has written for others. Maybe it's time for a collection of her writings from Time, the Wall Street Journal, as well as complete texts of her classic speeches? Publishers & editors should look into this.</span>
