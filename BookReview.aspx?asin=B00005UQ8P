                    <span>This is an age old tale set in an ancient village in the Himalaya. The old village chief insists on waiting to take a yak caravan over the mountain on the specific date given by the oracles. A young whippersnapper, Karma, who would like to take over the Chief's role sooner rather than later, insists on leaving immediately before the weather turns foul. Both are stubborn, insistent and unmoving in their decision of when to leave. Both can't be correct or can they? This is a contest between each man and the mountain and everyone wins, because "there are no accidents". A breathtaking film cinematically and one that echos the spirituality of the Tibetan people. Bruno Coulais' soundtrack for this film is absolutely perfect. Eric Valli's direction is amazing considering the cast are not actors. This movie will stay with you for a very long time.</span>

                    <span>This film has some of most breathtaking scenery ever filmed. Shot high up in a remote area of the Himalayas that has seen very few foreigners, it focuses on the Tibetan people who live in an area of the mountains called Dolpo. These people are referred to as Dolpopas. The love that the director, Eric Valli, has for this region of the world is palpable with the loving care and attention to detail that is lavished on this production. Shot at heights of up to 17,400 feet, this film is a tremendous achievement both cinematically and historically, as it locks in time a little known culture and way of life. <P>The story, which is based upon real life events, details a generational struggle between the young and the old. The storyline is simple. This isolated village is dependent upon trading its salt for grain, so that the village may survive. To do so, a caravan of yaks must make an arduous trek through the Himalayan Mountains to Nepal to effect such a trade. When one such caravan returns to the village, the caravan chief, is dead and his body has been brought back to the village by his best friend, Karma. The dead chief's father and tribal council memeber, Tinle, crazed with grief, suspects Karma of having brought about his son's death in an attempt to take his place as chief of the caravan. His dead son has left behind a beautiful wife, Pema, whom Karma covets, and a young son, whom Tinle wants designated as chief, despite his youth. <P>This sets into play a power struggle between Tinle and Karma, both of whom are headstrong and wilful. After the traditional sky burial for the dead caravan chief, this clash of wills results in two seperate caravans setting out on the salt trading trek. One is led by Karma who, accompanied by the village youth, defiantly leads his caravan out of the village before the date designated by the village lamas. The other is led by Tinle, who has persuaded his other son, Norbou, a Buddhist monk, to assist him. Accompanied by Norbou the elders of his village, as well as by his dead son's widow and young son, Tinle follows tradition and leaves on the date that the lamas have designated as being most propitious for the difficult journey. The film details each of the respective journeys, as well as the continuing battle of wills between the two leaders. The risks that Tinle takes on the journey in order to to catch up with Karma is captured in all its starkly beautiful, cinematic majesty and will leave viewers sitting on the edge of their seats.<P>Set against a breathtaking backdrop of Himalayan beauty, this is a must see film. The performances by those in lead roles are compelling. Thilen Lhondup, a real life former yak man who had fled Tibet during its invasion by China, is charismatic and powerful as Tinle. Gurgon Kyap imbues the role of the headstrong Karma with a youthful vigor and machismo. Lhakpa Tsamchoe, an exotic beauty who hails from Southern India by way of Tibetan parents, is wonderfully serene in the role of Pema. Karma Wangel is absolutely adorable as Tinle's grandson and will steal the viewers' hearts. <P>Anthropologically rich and visually beautiful, it took the director nine months to film this movie. The daunting logistics, the unpredictable weather, and the use of mostly non actors contributed to this being a time consuming project. In order to mainatain as much authenticity as possible, this film was shot entirely on location and the villagers even wore their own clothing in the film. The director's care and effort paid off, however, as this is one of the most stunningly beautiful films ever made. The musical score by Bruno Coulais is haunting, capturing the soaring majesty of the region, as well as some of its mystique. It also offers what I believe to be Tibetan throat singing, a somewhat esoteric form of singing/chanting not often heard in the western world.<P>This film, which was first released under the title "Caravan", was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000. I believe that it lost to Pedro Almodovar's film, "About My Mother", which is also an excellent movie. Having seen both films, however, there is no doubt in my mind that Valli's film should have been the one to walk away with the Academy Award.<P>The DVD is first rate, providing crystal clear visuals and audio. It is a value laden DVD, loaded with a number of interesting features. It offers a terrific director's commentary, as well as a delightful and informative featurette by Debra Kellner on the making of the film. There is also another interesting featurette, entitled "Electronic Press Kit", that contains some intriguing film clips and montages as to how certain things were done on the film, given the daunting logistics. This is a must have DVD for those who are interested in other cultures, the Himalayas, and, quite simply, a great film. Bravo! </span>

                    <span>On the surface this might seem like a movie to attract the art house set interested in a foreign location and foreign culture, but it is so much more. It is a timeless tale capturing timeless issues of the human condition, regardless of cultural boundaries. It is less about what it means to live in the Dolpo region of Nepal and more about the shift, balance, and tug between generations and the respect for tradition versus the pull of the younger set to move on.<P>The cinematography is exquisite. The scenery is the stark dry beauty of the Himalayas progressing with the story further and further up into the elevated reaches of snow covered passes. It is rare to see such beauty captured in other films. The scenery alone is worth the price of admission.<P>As if the window into the Himalayas wasn't enough, the story line is finely told, finely acted, and finely directed. There are scores of gems on what leadership is all about, how we sometimes have to bow to higher powers regardless of position, how the generations relate, how we mature, how we accept life and death, and how power shifts. Besides the depth of the culture-transcending story, we still get a window into the world of what a traders village in the Dolpo region of Nepal may be like. The oneness of life and the mountains, the salt and grain trade to sustain life, the reliance on the caravan, the system of chiefs, are all a wonderful way to gain a better understanding of another culture from the comfort of you living room. If you already had a healthy wanderlust for that part of the world, the film will only serve to stoke those flames.<P>Eric Valli's "Himalaya," is an epic beauty, a true masterpiece not to be missed.<BR>--MMW</span>

                    <span>1st of all, if the rating system allowed it, I'd give this film 3.5/5 stars. <P>Basically, I thought that this was a pretty interesting film to watch, especially for someone who doesn't know anything about Nepalese culture; it vividly immerses you in their daily life, complete with all of the throat singing, the rituals, the houses, the prayer wheels, everything. It was really quite a sight, even though I didn't understand some of what I saw; the movie isn't a documentary after all, so it has no obligation to explain these things for western viewers, and it often doesn't.<P>However, since it's not a documentary about the life of Nepalese people, but a MOVIE, I'm going to review it as such.<P>Where the movie falls short, in my opinion, is NOT in its pace; I never felt that the movie demanded a lot of the viewer, and it should be a relatively easy viewing for anyone (provided that that anyone doesn't mind subtitles). Nor is it with the story; it is fairly exciting and features great character development. <BR>Rather, I always felt that the director didn't really sympathize with his subject matter. The story is told, but it is always told from a distance; there is never a moment when the camera really zooms in on one of the characters to analyze their personality. We get to see an exact replica of the traditional Nepalese village, but despite all of the material things of that culture that we see, the movie doesn't really show their day-to-day life, but instead romanticizes everything slightly; looks at all of it like a tourist would. There is never a sense of real connection there, and I think that this movie could have been much better if the camera didn't always stay at an arm's length away from the characters.<P>If you're willing to forgive that, however, this film will show you more about Nepal than any other film you're likely to watch. Not psychologically, perhaps (only some of that), but materially at least. If you're even slightly interested, I say give it a try; The scenery is indeed beautiful.</span>
