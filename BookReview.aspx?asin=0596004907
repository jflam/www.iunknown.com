                <span id="Label1">ActionScript has blossomed into a large and important language whose sheer volume of capabilities can be daunting.  The <i>ActionScript Cookbook</i> breaks it all down into tasks that are relevant, practical, and insightful.  Appealing to the budding coder as well as the experienced ActionScript jockeys, this book offers new perspectives and approaches to ActionScript development that will empower all developers.  The <i>ActionScript Cookbook</i> contains over 300 recipes on a myriad of topics.  Here's a sampling of what you'll find:<ul><li>Drawing shapes at runtime</li><li>Controlling movie clips programmatically</li><li>Accepting user input and manipulating text strings</li><li>Accessing audio and video via Flash Communications Server</li><li>Working with Flash Remoting to connect to back end databases</li><li>Using record sets with data grids</li><li>And, much, much more in over 20 recipe-laden chapters</li><li>Seven full chapters of sample applications including a Video/Chat Message Server application and more</li></ul>This Cookbook's logical progression from short recipes for small problems to longer, more complex scripts for thornier riddles allows developers to link modular ActionScript pieces together to create rock-solid solutions for Flash applications. The <i>ActionScript Cookbook</i> is for people who say, "I understand everything in theory, but I don't know where to start in practice." This book is all about practice.</span>

                    <span>Get this book. That's really all that needs to be said. I'm a java guy learning flash, and what works best for me is a collection of practical (and useable in the real world) applications. That's exactly what this book is. And it's not the same thing you read in almost every programming book: 'this is a loop, this is a variable, this is a method...'. Useless stuff you have to wade thru to get to the meat. (...). I'm on MX 2004, and the book is for MX. (...) I can't wait for the next addition!!!</span>

                    <span>This is how more how-to books should be written. Action Script is the real power behind putting zoom and power into Flash projects, but with its full feature set it can be intimidating to learn how to use properly and many books fail in really explaining the why and how or fail to give any practical real world examples and quickly go off the deep end on wordy explinations of the syntax leaving you hanging, wanting some practical how do I USE what I just read.<p>This book is different! Its loaded with PRACTICAL, useful well commented examples of USING the code explained with hundreds of code snipets that you can use immidiately as-is or with little modification.<p>Starts with simpler things like lucid explainations of common pitfalls of checking equality and comparing values to if else expressions, while loops, more complex conditional testing then moves into areas most newbies want to learn how to do, but don't really have any practical examples like how to change a movie's transparency, drawing tricks, masking, etc.. Then it moves into examples of arrays, targeting, making objects dragable, swapping levels, interaction with buttons, validating forms and so on. <p>The book is well written and while there is plenty of technical information it never gets bogged down under the weight of excessive theory, minutia on details you'll rarely use and quickly forget anyway. Its much more of a friendly 'how do I do this' kind of approach that probably will make you reach for it again and again as a quick reference to solve common problems.<p>The last 200 pages or so give details of several more meaty projects. Unlike several books that 'explain' Action Script but all too often leave you hanging on how to actual use it, here you see how to use it in real world conditions which will save you hours of frustrating trial and error.</span>

                    <span>I said "excellent companion" in the title since I think it goes hand in hand with Moock's excellent "definitive guide".<p>I am a C, Perl programmer, and have started developing programs in ActionScript and since it has its own peculiarities (and not all that well documented) it is useful to see them included in specific examples. <p>I found the parts on Flash Remoting quite helpful in giving me ideas and practical solutions. I could not in all honesty give it 5 stars since I was not as happy with his extensive reliance on components. I do not find them very convenient if I am developing with ActionScript (in fact even when using Flash I have sometimes found it easier to write a short script for movie clips rather than configuring and adapting ready made components).</span>

                    <span>This book travels almost everywhere with me, along with Colin Moock's ASDG2.  Where ASDG2 stops Joey Lott picks up the pieces and assembles them into practical and useful examples that can be directly applied to everyday projects.<p>The Actionscript Cookbook should be a part of any developers library.  Joey Lott's books consistently impress me as I've also found the Complete Flash Remoting to be invaluable to have around.</span>
