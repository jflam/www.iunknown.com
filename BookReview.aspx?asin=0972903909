                <span id="Label1">Detailing what can go wrong in backup and recovery and how this applies to the various backup methods available, this book couples that information with recovery and business continuity tactics played out over the backdrop of various real-world scenarios. Covered is how freezes, corruption, and loss affects documents, equipment, and day-to-day business activities, and the cost of downtime and job re-creation is explained in a way that builds the best budget for availability, backup, and recovery. Protection and restoration of user data and from various locations and times is also covered, as well as how to keep a business running after a power failure, network failure, or other unforeseen event.</span>

                    <span>I really enjoyed this book. The information is accurate, up-to-date, and very helpful to anyone wanting to run a trouble-free technology department. Disaster recovery and data security are hot topics. The book explains concepts that most any IT professional can grasp, as well as enough detail to implement it as part of a corporate technology plan.<P>Not only is the information good, the writing style and illustrations hold your interest. This is not the same old drab technical writing. It is acually fun to read!</span>

                    <span>A number of things set The Backup Book apart from others:<P>1. The writing is fantastic -- friendly and easy to follow.<BR>2. The examples are real -- the authors have great experiences we can learn from (without having to go through it ourselves!)<BR>3. The book is complete -- they cover everything from determining which data is critical to a variety of methods one can use to protect the data.<P>I also like how the authors interlace the experiences of "field editors" -- other folks who know what they're talking about -- throughout the book.<P>If you're involved in network management and/or data security, you need to read this book.</span>

                    <span>This book would have been great if it was 60% of the pages with the fluff and jokes cut out. Backup is a serious subject, and a few jokes may be cute, but they pervade the book to the point of becoming annoying. There is also too much time spent on the bare basics - it sometimes felt like the author had a page quota to meet.<BR>That said, it appears to be the only game in town covering the subject to this breadth and depth, and when the author cuts to the chase, he clearly has a good understanding of the problems and soulutions, with only a few technical errors (amusingly, the errors are just where the author appears to be trying to impress the reader with the depth of their knowledge.)</span>

                    <span>If you are an IT professional and you are responsible for the security and integrity of data, you must have this book! It could save you save a lot of headache, and possibly your job!<P>This book has something for every IT manager, it doesn't matter whether your site is small or large, Mac or Windows centric or whether you have a corrupt document or a database, this book has something for you.<P>Keep this book by your side. Read it. Learn from it. I know I do. I keep a copy on my desk. This book contains the compiled wisdom of people who've lost battles, but have learned from these catastrophes.<P>I'm a policy fanatic and the stuff in this book will help you formulate rock solid policies for your organization. With policies in place, you will be better able to deal with disasters WHEN they strike!<P>I believe it's a great resource to help justify appropriation requests for new infrastructure gear or resources. The investment for this tome is nil but the benefits priceless. Do something smart and get this book.</span>

You will sleep better.</span>
