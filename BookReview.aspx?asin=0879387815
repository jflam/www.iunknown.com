                    <span>I just recently purchased this book and i loved it from the second i opened it. If you are interested in the Navy SEALs or anything about them, this book is right for you. It explains the SEALs in great detail and informs you about the missions they conduct, BUD/S training, the history of the SEAL Teams, techniques they use, pretty much everything. There are great photographs. I love this book, and i'm sure you will too.</span>

                    <span>To be honest, I am a little disappointed. I expected more details about different types of equipment used in different missions. But I might have felt this way, because I couldn't get enough of that stuff! All in all, the book is fun to read. It is written very well and contains many very good pictures.</span>

                    <span>This is a good overview of various aspects of U.S. Navy SEALs training and operations (at least those that aren't classified). It has a surprising amount of information in it, given that this is a relatively small book! It's also entertaining to read: the author did a good job with his writing, giving the reader some good technical information without getting too "dry" in presenting it. However, there ARE some technical inaccuracies present: for instance, to the best of my knowledge there IS no such thing as an "H&K MP4 submachine gun." The weapons the author shows in all of the pictures and calls "MP4" are H&K MP5s. Still, this is a good, compact resource, despite the minor errors.</span>
