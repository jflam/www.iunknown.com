                    <span>I wholeheartedly agree with the previous review! The book is LOADED with glaring errors! 3 that come to mind: North By Northwest's famous cropdusting scene was set in Illinois, not Texas, which he mentions more than once. Grace Kelly did not die in 1979 and there is a great picture, elsewhere, of GK and "Hitch" at the function this author uses for a reference point of Hitch's dead friends and sad end of life, and he refers to Patricia Collinge as Joseph Cottens mother in "Shadow Of A Doubt": She was his loving sister. He also misquotes Psycho and several of the biggest films in AH career. Didnt this guy have a fact checker to help him? He is also very coarse in his descriptions of people in Hitchcocks life: Anthony Perkins looked like a retarded child? I only gave it 3 stars for the rare pics that are included. Buy it when its in the remainder bin or used on Ebay!</span>

                    <span>I purchased this book after seeing it in a brief magazine write up. The book has way too much text and a fraction of the documentation of the Hitchcock Style that I had anticipated. I attempted to read the text, but the the author's frustrating writing style kept me from succeeding. Maybe something got lost in the translation from French to English? Anyway, for those able to survive the awkward jumping back and forth between periods in time, beware. Just from skimming the text I found one glaring error. The author refers to Grace Kelly as being deceased in 1979, when she actually passed away in the early 1980s. Save your money. You can thumb through this book in a few minutes at your local library or bookstore.</span>
