                <span id="Label1">Adobe Acrobat 6.0 Standard software lets business professionals quickly and easily convert any Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, or other paper or electronic document to a reliable Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Adobe PDF files preserve the visual integrity of documents so that they can be e-mailed to colleagues and then viewed and printed on a variety of platforms using free Adobe Reader software. <p>   Acrobat 6.0 Standard software&#146;s intuitive review tools allow business professionals to comment on documents electronically and make it easy to track, manage, and incorporate feedback into original documents. Acrobat&#146;s full set of features help you streamline communications and reduce the costs and inefficiencies associated with paper-based review processes.<p>  Password protection lets you secure files to prevent unauthorized users from opening and viewing sensitive documents. Apply permissions with 128-bit encryption that control whether users are allowed to view, edit, comment on, sign, or print Adobe PDF files.  And with digital signature support you can approve final documents, verify authenticity, and build a list of trusted certificates.</span>

                    <span>I've been a fan (and user) of Acrobat for many years, and am continually amazed by the number of organizations that *don't* circulate their documents in PDF format. I don't even *read* Word attachments anymore, for fear of viruses and because I *know* they won't look like the author intended.
<br />
<br />However, earlier versions have each added great new features, and the differences of v6 over v5 just don't seem substantial enough to warrant the price or effort of upgrading. For most users, I'd recommend saving dough by finding a copy of version 5, a vast improvement over versions 1 thru 4, and of course a conceptual and practical leap (or three) beyond sharing documents in native formats such as Word.</span>

                    <span>It's obvious that Adobe feels safe and entrenched as THE maker of PDF creation software, because Acrobat installs like a herd of elephants moving in to your computer. It completely re-worked my MS Word toolbars and would not allow me to restore them the way I want them. (Even after un-installation, there is still something at work against my normal.dot template.) Other applications felt the impact, too. All I want is a way to make PDF files, not a new lifestyle.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Acrobat 6 could not deliver the PDF files for me. On a P4, 1.8 Ghz system, I allowed it to process my Word document for 5 hours before I gave up and had to get some real work done. I went and found activePDF Composer, which handled the same Word file and delivered my PDF file in just 10 minutes.
<br />
<br />Get over yourself, Adobe.</span>

                    <span>I spoke with Adobe today and they confirmed my conclusions regarding their "security" features. While they state in their advertising and by phone through customer support that you can disable unauthorized people from saving, using "save as", and emailing files made secure by you, the originator, it is indeed UNTRUE. Confirmed today by phone, after close to a dozen calls, readers of "secure" documents, can indeed use the aforementioned commands to commandeer your proprietary documents and drawings. You can, however, get the features they claim to be included in version 6.0 (and upcoming 7.0) through Adobe Solutions, but to the expense of roughly $2000. As if this wasn't enough, once you get the software and start to use it, Adobe adds a disclaimer that users of some third-party, non-Adobe pdf viewers, can access your "secure" documents. Undoubtedly, the remaining features of their product are of great value, but these misrepresentations and untruths in advertising noteworthily deserve 1 star and a place in the hall of software shame. P.S. Version 7.0, soon to be released, has the same misrepresentations.</span>
