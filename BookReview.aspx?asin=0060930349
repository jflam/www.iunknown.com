                <span id="Label1">Paul Johnson, whose previous works include the distinguished <I>Modern Times</I> and <I>A History of the Jews</I>, has produced an epic that spans the history of the American people over the past 400 years. The prolific narrative covers every aspect of U.S. history, from science, customs, religion, and politics to the individual men and women who have helped shape the nation. His detailed, provocative examinations of political and social icons, from Lyndon Johnson to Norman Rockwell, are especially strong. Johnson's text is intelligent and rich with detail, and yet extremely accessible for anyone interested in a reinterpretive analysis of America's past. <p> What makes this book unique is Johnson's approach to this self-professed Herculean task. The prevalent tone throughout is optimism. Whether he's discussing race relations, industrialization, the history of women, immigrants, Vietnam, or political correctness, Johnson--a staunch conservative who was born, bred, and educated in England--is openly enamored with America's past, particularly the hardships and tribulations that the nation has had to overcome. He sees this story as a series of important lessons, not just for Americans but for the whole of mankind as well. At a time when other contemporary scholars find it easier to bemoan the past, Johnson offers the reader "a compelling antidote to those who regard the future with pessimism."</span>

                    <span>Boy, am I glad I finally picked up this one. This has been fifth Johnson's book I read; without this one, I would probably go on reading and have to un-learn even more.
<br />Johnson's writes in the grand tradition of British tabloid journalism: looking for sensation and scandal, with an abundance of often patronizing opinions and utter disregard for objectivity. As long as you do not know what he writes about, it is entertaining and enjoyable. As soon as you enter the subjects you are familiar with, you will either smile (if you like his bias) or open your eyes wide with horror.
<br />So do yourself a favor, read about 10 pages from the last chapter and you will immediately know if this book is for you.
<br />As for me, I am finished with Johnson!</span>

                    <span>I came away from reading this book with mixed feelings, but I knew I would do that before I even started it.  I have read other Johnson books before, most notably "Modern Times," so I knew that Johnson is a conservative, and I fully expected that point of view to be reflected in this book.  [...]
<br />
<br />First, the positive.  Johnson is an excellent stylist, which of course makes him highly readable.  He has an astonishing ability to gather mountains of material and weave it into his narrative.  His narrative begins in pre-colonial days and ends with the Clinton administration.  He tends to overdo statistics a bit, such as detailing the increase in the numbers of bales of cotton produced in the pre-Civil War south, and when he does this my eyes start to glaze over.  Fortunately, these instances are relatively infrequent.  He also reveals interesting tidbits of trivia that humanize some of his subjects.  In some ways reading Johnson is as enjoyable as reading a novel.
<br />
<br />However, when Johnson arrives at the twentieth century, he ceases  being a historian and becomes a polemicist.  Now I am not stating that Johnson does not have a right to his opinions.  But these opinions should be based on a responsible and thorough rendering of the facts.  This means that he has a responsibility to search for the facts as assiduously as possible, to present them to the reader thoroughly, withholding nothing relevant, and then give us his opinion.  Instead, on many occasions, Johnson presents as rumor and innuendo as fact, without any qualification, and he omits important facts.  He also engages in highly specious reasoning.  (...)
<br />
<br />this is not to recommend against the book.  As I stated initially, it is an excellent read, and I have no reason to question the factuality of Johnson's reportage on earlier eras.  But the reader should be aware that when it comes to the 1960 election and everything following, Johnson may not be reporting all the facts.</span>

                    <span>Can one perform experimentation in history? Strictly speaking, no. Nonetheless, I decided to try an experiment of my own by reading two diametrically opposed books simultaneously: Paul Johnson's A History of the American People and Howard Zinn's A People's History of The United States. What follows emphasizes Johnson's work.
<br />
<br />Some full disclosure is in order. I didn't expect to care much for Johnson. His politics are too well known and too easily debunked for that. Nonetheless, I found that his narrative was clear and engaging, and although his opinions sometimes slip out, they are generally innocuous or even relevant. Johnson does understand much of what makes America special, and for that I can applaud him. Furthermore, he follows an appropriate style of historical analysis for a survey work. The text transitions smoothly among politics, economics, and social and intellectual themes. One can disagree with him on points without losing the general flow of information. From the early discovery by Europeans to the dawn of the Twentieth Century Johnson weaves a rich narrative that is well worth its time.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the last two sections. Not only does Johnson give up any pretense of objectivity beginning roughly with the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, but he also changes the style of writing. It seems that with the last century, Johnson could no longer pretend to be a historian and rather shows himself to be nothing more than another spin-doctor. Although it starts off only moderately strong, the text became almost laughable by the time we reach the Cold War era. His analysis of the presidents, which becomes a subject of greater coverage, is strictly partisan. Every president from Wilson to Reagan, with the exceptions only of Hoover and Truman, reads as nothing more than hagiography for the Republicans and a scandal sheet for Democrats. This can make for some surreal reading. Besides his somewhat lengthy writing on Harding and Coolidge, two of our more forgettable presidents, he goes on to vilify Herbert Hoover for being nothing more than a flaming liberal whose desperate attempts to help people just deepened the Great Depression. Say again? Of course, this pales in comparison to his commentary on Roosevelt and Kennedy, the latter of whom, according to Johnson, didn't really win the 1960 election after all. One wonders how America survived the coming of not one but two antichrists in one century. Contrast this to Saint Nixon, a decent and honorable man who never did anything wrong and was forced out of office in a putsch engineered by newspapers and having nothing to do with actual felonious behavior. One wonders how Johnson will ever manage to sugarcoat any second edition, since such a book would have to cover a genuinely pointless and partisan impeachment and an actual electoral theft. He's dug himself a rather deep hole here. Worst of all is that most of the last four hundred pages go on like this. There are some ideological surprises. Besides Hoover and Truman, Johnson also surprisingly bolts from his ideology in thoroughly condemning Joe McCarthy as a drunken grandstander. But for the most part, the worthiness of the earlier sections is lost both in content and style.
<br />
<br />The first six hundred pages are generally worth reading for anyone interested in a good summary of American history. As a survey work, Johnson puts together a good work. The relevance of his topics is generally clear and appropriate, with only occasional quirkiness (four pages on Coke, for example). As for the later pages, conservatives can sit back and take pleasure in reading their tabloid textbook, but it's not so malicious that liberals can't slog through it. We do need to remind ourselves sometimes of what the other side is saying, and this is probably among the less offensive of sources.
<br />
<br />How does Johnson compare with Zinn? Ultimately, Johnson and Zinn proved too different from each other to sit down and make a side-by-side comparison, even though I read them both as closely together in chronology as I could, often reading about the same events on the same day. While Johnson at least has delivered an actual history book, Zinn's effort produced just so much trash. They do not in any way complement each other, nor does reading both allow any sort of Hegelian synthesis. So the experiment was a failure. There is no yin or yang here. I do make a cautious recommendation for Johnson so long as the reader ventures within carefully. A better option would be the somewhat hard-to-find The Growth of the American Republic, by Samuel Eliot Morison.

                    <span>Paul Johnson's book makes all of American history entertaining and interesting for the general, if open-minded, reader. There are two prominent Amazon reviewer comments that I disagree with:
<br />
<br />1. The Suggestion that we should ignore the post-1960 material
<br />I agree that after 1960, Johnson's description of events appears to be largely sympathetic to Nixon and an aggressive attack on Kennedy. This is not necessarily due to a change in Johnson's analysis as it is the familiarity of the readers with the subject. We have to stop expecting American history to be something not to be questioned. Johnson had every right (and obligation) to argue against affirmative action, for example, as much as he had the right to refute the popular understanding of the riots in New York during the Civil War. "Objectivity" is an impossible standard in history; instead Johnson gives us his conclusions and judgements with the reasons he has for making those judgements.
<br />
<br />2. The "anecdotal history" comment
<br />This history is anything but a collection of anecdotes. Johnson includes many stories to give us an understanding of the personalities of historical figures, but this book is packed with facts and numbers, fully referenced. "Anecdotal" history would be what most Americans had to sit through in high school. Not so with Johnson's book.
<br />
<br />I don't give this book 5 Stars for being perfect. It is not perfect. Many episodes of American history are lightly covered and in my opinion under-represented. That is why one should find other books (e.g. Max Boot's book on small wars, Eric Schlosser's book on fast food) that do an excellent job filling our understanding of how America in its present form came to be. But I believe Johnson's book to be the best of its kind, by quite a margin.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I get a kick out of all this 'objectivity' nonsense when people talk about history.  I have yet to read anything, much less a history book that does not have a bias in it.  All writings are written by people and since all people have preconceived notions and ideas about everything, it will show through in the writing.  Johnson is a conservative and clearly favors democracy and free trade and is clearly anti-socialism and government interference (he seems thoroughly familiar with economics and the tragedies wrought on humanity by those who are not).  Throughout this book, he presents a powerful arguement to back these ideas.
<br />
<br />Johnson, also, finds historical people much more fascinating than historical events and ideas.  With an elegant style, he brings to life personalities that have been dead for centuries and is able to shed light on how they influenced events.  Also, he talks about how people were and not just about the ideologies they put forth.  This provides for a remarkable look at some of America's most influential mothers and fathers.  Johnson discusses what he sees as flaws in a person's character and balances this with what he sees as virtues, leaving no doubt as to whether or not he views a person as fundamentally virtuous or flawed.  
<br />
<br />In addition to this human view of history, he takes the time to discuss cultural history in addition to political and economic history.  He mentioned many works of art and literature, as well as artists and writers, providing me with a nice reference of American art and literature. 
<br />
<br />Like many of his other books, his writing style is superb.  And he provides a very human touch to history.  
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this book. </span>
