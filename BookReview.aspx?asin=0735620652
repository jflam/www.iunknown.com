                    <span>This "kit" is well put together and covers the exam thoroughly.  I also have a couple of years supporting XP but this book covers the stuff that is rare but tested on the exam.  I thought it was well written and is pretty much all I studied for the exam.  
<br />
<br />The CD comes with some good testing software and the questions in some instances very closely mirrored ones on the actual exam.  
<br />
<br />So, I would say, study, with XP running on a machine go through the exercises, get up to 90% or more on the practice exams, and you should do fine.
<br />
<br />Good luck.</span>

                    <span>I have to agree with the comment that this book goes a lot further than previous MS texts. It actually tries to give you enough info to pass the exam rather than giving you inadequate info so that you get hit with questions far removed from what you learnt. I suspect the latter is because MS want to make their exams as hard as possible what with the proliferation of MCSErs. I mean think about it - why would Microsoft want to make it easy for you to pass their exams? They want you to WORK for their qualification and dont want paper MCSE candidates. I have this book but nevertheless I obtain a lot of info from other sources.
<br />
<br />I agree this book is far removed from MS 72-270, 70-215 etc study guides. Its a good book!</span>

                    <span>microsoft has finally figured out how to write a book for their certifications.  hire someone outside their organization to do it.  previous books have always fallen woefully short of teaching a person to the point that they can come close to passing the test.  this book accomplishes this goal.  admittedly, this is a verrrry simple and easy test.  but i did find the objectives covered adequately to figure out the answers.  this was microsoft's big failing in previous books.  they skimmed over or inadequately explained the topic and then hit you with detailed and complex scenarios on the exam that were several levels more advanced than what they taugh you.  this book brings you to the level you need to be able to figure out the answers you need.  this is what microsoft should have been doing all along.  kudos to them.  </span>

                    <span>Suppose you were looking to hire someone for your help desk. You narrow it down to the final two candidates You ask them how well they know Windows XP. One says, "I know it pretty well." The other says, "I'm a Microsoft Certified Desktop Support Technician on Windows XP." Which would you hire? 
<br />
<br />That's not to say that the first candidate wouldn't do a fine job for you. But it is to say that the second candidate will give you a higher feeling of confidence. To make yourself be the second candidate is the only reason for taking this test. 
<br />
<br />Oh, one thing more, besides just taking it, you need to pass it. And that is the reason for having this book. It will help you pass the test. 
<br />
<br />The contents of the book are just about what you'd expect: everything you need to know to support end users running (or trying to run XP). Among everything else this includes: installing, setting up users and groups, understanding file and folder access, installing and managing hardware (display, I/O, storage, printers), networking, accessing the internet. And each of these subjects is the subject of a chapter in the book. 
<br />
<br />And because this is a training kit for the test, it has extensive review questions and a CD with additional questions and information. Finally this kit will give you a 15% discount in the cost of the test. </span>

                    <span>More like a cook book, e.g. recipes for opening menus/sub-menus. "Objective review" question explanations are keyed to book.  "Practice questions" on CD are keyed to courses offered through Microsoft and not the book. Many practice question subjects, e.g. Software Security Policies, VPNs, IEEE1394 pin/power supply, modification of boot.ini, Active Directory, WinXP power options, not covered.If objective review questions represent actual exam -great. If the practice tests on CD represent exam - you need other study material.</span>
