                <span id="Label1">As oil was the crisis of the twentieth century, water is the crisis of the twenty-first. Less than .0008 percent of the total water on Earth is fit for human consumption, but global consumption of fresh water is doubling every twenty years. Water has become perhaps our most precious commodity-a life-sustaining but increasingly rare and privatized resource. A dramatic gap exists between those who have adequate water for survival and those who don't, and tensions over water in some areas of the world hover just below open war.<br><br> From Europe to Asia to Africa to America, award-winning journalist Jeffrey Rothfeder has visited the world's hot spots with the least amount of water, and also places where there is so much of it that plans are in the works to sell the excess to the highest bidder.  In this compelling narrative account of our world in turmoil over water, he describes the issues and struggles of the people on all sides of the water crisis: from the scarred survivors of bizarre water-management practices, to those who are willing to die for water to sustain their families and crops, to the scientists and leaders who are trying to set things straight.<br><br> Important, provocative, and immensely readable, <i>Every Drop for Sale</i> explores a fascinating critical dilemma: as we run out of it, is water a fundamental right of everybody on Earth or just a human need that can be bought and sold like any other commodity? </span>

                    <span>An excellent book on discussing the perils of ignoring the scarcity of water resources...It provides a fairly chilling account of what has potentially gone wrong in water management projects in different parts of the world. The book also discusses the use of water as a potential war/bargaining tool as discussed in the context of an early Arab plan to divert the Jordan River from Israel and Turkey/Syria skirmishes related to Kurdish unrest in that region. After reading those segments, one cant help but wonder why these issues are not discussed with more sense of urgency. <P>Though the book provides some interesting "facts and figures", most of its arguments is based on author's own intrepretation and not much independent confirmations. Some of the arguments degenerate to what can be percieved as political agenda, while some of the arguments, ironically, doesnt hold any water. The author does deserve credit for the well thought thesis and discussion on the premises..The arguments on "why" and "what" went wrong could have risen above personal opinion/speculation...<P>The narration is interesting, and the author spices the discussion with some character sketches..A good read, but will be disappointed if you are looking for the book to live up to the hype its title could convey...</span>

                    <span>then you have saved the world.<P>Jeff Rothfeder does an in-depth analysis of our relationship to water, its availability and scarcity, and finally, the gross mismanagement to date that has brough tus to the crisis today. In the USA, it seems like water is abundant and shortages are a problem in faraway nations, but he points out that California and Nevada are actually arid deserts that should not sustain life at all, yet they do from water pumped in from a rapidly drying reservoir.<P>Rothfeder also writes "snapshots" of various people's lives who have been gravely affected by lack of water, flooding (which occurs when dams burst), or mismanagement and/or privatization of water. He gives examples that range from a pipeline project headed by women in one community in Kenya, to the dust storms one family faces in a little town in California -- the Golden State, land of dreams.<P>The next world war will be fought over water, predicts one official, and as water is seen as a commodity and not as a basic human right, it has already started. Rothfeder gives the example of Cochbamba, Bolivia, where the people battled against the globalization of their water, which resulted in 2 teenagers being killed.<P>This is a book that truly everyone needs to read, and it will encourage them to stop wasting and start conserving if we as a planet are to survive.</span>

                    <span>I was prepared to like this book and be convinced of its premise, but was sorely disappointed. It is mostly undocumented and seems to reflect only the author's opinion. <BR>I call it a "colorful" read since the writing consists of yellow journalism, purple prose, and white lies.<P>I compared it most unfavorably with "A River Lost" a wonderfully researched and well written book on the Columbia River. Mr. Rothfeder simply pushes his own ideas and bends the facts to fit his views.</span>

                    <span>How much would you pay for water to sustain your life? Obviously, you would be willing to pay a lot. That fact concerns Mr. Rothfeder because he fears that water is about to become prohibitively expensive . . . or just not available for more and more of the world's people. As a case in point, Bechtel took over the water system of Cochabamba, Bolivia and raised water prices to the level equal to what the poorest people paid for all of their food. Soon, the town was in revolt, martial law was declared, and events would have only gotten worse if Bolivia had not terminated the contract. If you remember your French history, the end of the monarchy coincided with a period of rapidly rising bread prices. <P>From there, you will learn that 1.1 billion people each day don't get enough water to drink and to clean themselves and their clothes. Many more don't get enough pure water. No one knows for sure, but it seems like the amount of untreated pure water declines each year while the population grows. If those trends cross, massive water famines will be ahead. Mr. Rothfeder argues for having those in the developed world pay a disproportionately high price for water and use some of that to subsidize making water available to poor people everywhere. A potential benefit of this higher price in the developed world will be to reduce water consumption. An average shower in the United States consumes more water than the poorest people get in water-short areas in two or three days. <P>The background is discouraging. People are pouring into areas where there isn't enough water to support them (like southern California, Arizona, Atlanta, and Florida). Dam projects make less pure water available, harm wildlife and plants, displace people, and create risk of worse flooding. Draining too much water from areas (like the Owens Valley in California) leaves environmentally devastated areas where toxic wastes from former lake bottoms blow through the high winds harming everyone's health. Almost all of the World Bank money for water projects goes to make just this sort of dam, to create electricity for industry, and steady sources of water for irrigation on large farms. <P>Recently, companies have been buying up water distribution operations. Often the results, however, aren't very good. Executives may just pay themselves well, raise prices, and ignore quality. The U.K. added regulation (of the sort that we used to have with electricity in the United States) and found the results improved. <P>Some innovations are more promising. Water is being shipped in bags through the ocean. Desalinization is very expensive, but supplies a lot of the fresh water on the Arabian peninsula. Some harmful dams are being decommissioned. Systems-oriented solutions are being developed in some areas, such as the rehydration of the Everglades in Florida with water that would otherwise go out to sea. Gorbachev's Green Cross has had some successes with helping to broker regional water solutions. <P>When more water is available, wonderful things can happen. In a village in Kenya, women had to carry 70 pound jugs of water for miles for their families. The men didn't help. Development brought funds for pumps, and water was now only a few feet away. The quality of family life and prosperity of the villagers were much improved . . . for a while. Then thieves stole the pumps one night, and things went back to where they had been. <P>Overhanging all of this is the potential for regional wars over water. Mr. Rothfeder argues that the Six Day War was primarily triggered by the Arab plan to divert the Jordan River away from Israel. During the Gulf War, Iraq destroyed Kuwait's desalinization plants, Coalition Forces destroyed a lot of Iraq's water infrastructure, and Iraq used water warfare to control southern tribes. More recently, Turkey, Syria, and Jordan have been jockeying to get access to the water that the Kurdish regions in Turkey can supply. <P>The book is filled with interesting examples that will give you a much better sense of the fresh water situation. Unfortunately, the author's investigation of how to best solve the problem is dealt with in very sketchy terms. Clearly, if substantial funds were available, much more pure water could be provided. The question of who will pay for the poor in developing and underdeveloped countries is the hard question. When former Senator McGovern looked at whether world hunger could be eliminated, he found the cost was a reasonable one for the wealthiest countries to bear and much progress followed. A similar look is needed at making pure water available in the most efficient and effective way for the long-term. Even in the areas where the shortages are the greatest (like the U.S. Southwest) most of the water is still used for agriculture, and very little is paid for that water. So, this issue also requires thinking through price subsidies for agriculture. <P>Interestingly, Enron (which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy) was cited as one of the leaders in providing more pure water in the future around the world. That reference seemed ironic in light of recent events at the company. <P>Make part of your sharing with others include making more pure water available! Many charities have programs to help poor villagers install pumps and learn how to maintain them in water-short areas like the drier parts of Africa. <P></span>

                    <span><BR><BR>This is an hysterical title, but nevertheless offers a good overview of the methods by which potable water makes it to where the people are. We should always remember the wise words of Sam Kinison about living in the desert. Of course, when he said that, he was a resident of Los Angeles.<BR><BR>According to this author, desalination is no cheaper than delivery by floating bags. Apparently he hasn't got up to date info from the eastern Mediterranean. Desalination (many methods are available, as he notes) is the way of the future.<BR><BR>The biggest problem area in water distribution is the use of open canals in hot, dry areas. Most significantly, Los Angeles gets its water supply that way, and Egypt is losing arable land every year in part because of a failure to arrest evaporation losses.<BR><BR>The Med-Dead project (to bring water from the Mediterranean into the Dead Sea, as a way to supply Jordan; instead, Jordan wants a canal from Aqaba, along the Saudi-Israeli border for political and military reasons) and the Med-Qattara project will probably never materialize for economic reasons.<BR><BR>The Aral Sea basin was devastated by Soviet land use and water use practices, making the contested valley along the Afghan border significant to the world at large.<BR><BR>The Kuwaitis and Iranians are building a way (Japanese contractor I believe) to move water from western Iran to oil-wealthy Kuwait, via a pipeline under the Persian Gulf. The Turks intend to build an anchored pipeline from a hydro project to the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (the Turkish enclave of Cyprus, an independent nation recognized only by Turkey). If brought to fruition, each of these projects will have political and military significance.<BR><BR>The hysteria of the title is a bit much precisely because water doesn't go away; no matter how tainted, it can be filtered and reused. The world is people, and people aren't short of water. Agricultural irrigation uses something like ten times as much water as other uses, but requires less treatment. Obviously we need agriculture, and the other uses can be easily satisfied using current sources merely by cheap methods of conservation.<BR><BR></span>
