                <span id="Label1">The Nazis may have given eugenics its negative connotations, but the practice-and the "science" that supports it-is still disturbingly alive in America in anti-immigration initiatives, the quest for a "gay gene," and theories of collective intelligence. Tracing the historical roots and persistence of eugenics in the United States, Nancy Ordover explores the political and cultural climate that has endowed these campaigns with mass appeal and scientific legitimacy.   <P>American Eugenics demonstrates how biological theories of race, gender, and sexuality are crucially linked through a concern with regulating the "unfit." These links emerge in Ordover's examination of three separate but ultimately related American eugenics campaigns: early twentieth-century anti-immigration crusades; medical models and interventions imposed on (and sometimes embraced by) lesbians, gays, transgendered people, and bisexuals; and the compulsory sterilization of poor women and women of color. Throughout, her work reveals how constructed notions of race, gender, sexuality, and nation are put to ideological uses and how "faith in science" can undermine progressive social movements, drawing liberals and conservatives alike into eugenics-based discourse and policies.  <P>Nancy Ordover is an independent scholar who lives in New York City.</span>

                    <span>Ordover's well-focused historical eye counteracts the problematic tendency to minimize America's brutality in the constructions of race and sexual orientation; these constructions serve liberal and conservative politic and scientic thought but which yield devastating consequences for the actual lives under the microscope. Her rigorous research deserves accolades. Subtle eugenicist-thought pervades so much contemporary debate on issues from immigration to gay rights. Amazing book.  </span>

                    <span>This books fallacious argument is that Race is `constructed' and `pseudo-scientific'.  This claim alone should relegate this book to obvious inaccuracy.  Anyone with even one eye can determine exactly what race someone is by looking at them, the exception being people of mixed heritage.  But modern anthropology taught at every college in America teaches the physical differences of indigenous people of Africa, Asia and Europe.  But beyond this false argument the book then descends into the swampish argument that Eugenics have been used in America for `sexist' and `homophobic' purposes.  How is this possible?  Are their more men in America then women?  No.  So how were Eugenic used for sexist reasons.  This argument is never backed up, it is just said with the idea that the audience will gobble up this as `truth'.  And how can genetics have been used to `homophobic' reasons when even the most left wing homosexual activists admit no `gay gene' exists.  This argument is simply pure fallacy and this book makes many outlandish claims that seem to be in line with the statement `if you tell a big enough lie enough times people will believe it'.  Not a reliable text.  <p>Seth J. Frantzman</span>

                    <span>This book documents the immeasurable harm that can be generated from a pseudo-scientific concept, such as 'race.' It has been demonstrated repeatedly by the science of genetics that the concept of 'race' is scientifically invalid.<p> Though European physical anthropologists of the 17th and 18th centuries proposed various systems of racial classifications based on such observable characteristics as skin color, hair type, body proportions, and skull measurements, codifying the perceived differences among broad geographic populations of humans, science of the 20th and 21st century now know that these are bogus and logically unsupported classifications. <p>Even the term 'Caucasian'--used almost exclusively to mean "white" or "European" actually includes a variety of peoples generally categorized as nonwhite. <p>As 20th and 21st century science now shows, the biological aspect of race is described today not in observable physical features but rather in such genetic characteristics as blood groups and metabolic processes. <p>This means that a person who is considered black in one society might be nonblack in another. Most cultural anthropologists now consider race to be more a social or mental construct than an objective biological fact. <p>This scientific fact may disappoint those persons of a racist bent, such as members of the National Alliance, but science does not support the concept of race.

                    <span>I gave this book 3 stars because it is completely full of Politically Correct nonsense that flies in the face of billions of years of evolutionary history plainly available to modern science. It has value to me mainly in that we can see here clearly the mind-numbng effects of social pressures and politically correct mindsets. It is very educational about the effects of the brainwashing we receive on these topics every day. She talks about race as being a "constructed" concept--basically saying we made it up--yet it is a fact of nature that we differ in various races according to a whole constellation of physical and mental characteristics. Our cultures are very different also as a result. Pretty shocking stuff that she would say this was made up... You must read this book for this reason alone. That is why I gave it 3 stars.</span>

                    <span>This book provokes! Well researched (many original sources) it clearly shows how eugenics has been an on-going and central part of the national dialogue. I like the book too because it shows how both the left and the right use eugenics rhetoric to employ their politic. Turns out that eugenics is not a freakish back-room operation just used by hitler but actually saturates the way politicians, the legal system and various american factions and individuals express themselves in public policy. Racist, sexist, and homophobic ideology are the nutrients that strengthen the American eugenics movement today. Scary!</span>
