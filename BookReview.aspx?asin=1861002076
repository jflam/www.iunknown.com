                <span id="Label1"><I>Professional Visual Basic 6 Distributed Objects</I> is an intelligent guide to component design for anyone who builds Visual Basic (VB) components. This is an authoritative guide to creating state-of-the-art scalable distributed components with Visual Basic 6, and it takes full advantage of the Microsoft Distributed interNet Architecture (DNA) platform.<p> The heart of this text is the author's design philosophy for building distributed components with VB, which he calls his Component-based Scalable Logical Architecture (CSLA). The author shows how to design objects that take full advantage of some of the latest Microsoft features and tools. (The examples in this book use objects for a project manager application, which are enhanced chapter by chapter.)<p> By following the prescription outlined here, VB developers can create scalable objects that support transactions (with MTS), data binding (with OLE DB and ADO), and even message-based event delivery across multiple servers on the enterprise (with MSMQ). The author also shows how the same objects can be used with ASPs on the Web. Clearly, the CSLA has a lot of potential for building objects that scale well and meet the needs of today's enterprise.<p> <I>Professional Visual Basic 6 Distributed Objects</I> is written in a no-nonsense style, with short paragraphs and practical examples used throughout. The author's experience with design for VB enterprise-level lets him show that today's Visual Basic is ready to take on the enterprise on the Microsoft platform. For enterprise development, both on and off the Web, this guide makes a strong pitch for a spot on the bookshelf of anyone serious about VB development. <I>--Richard Dragan</I></span>

                    <span>The concepts and ideas presented in this book (as well as the Business Objects book) should be in the "toolbox" of every serious Visual Basic developer. The examples are concise and the concepts are easy to read and understand. I recently developed an n-tier e-commerce web application using the author's concepts for the middle tier. This was my first full-scale, enterprise-level effort, and I found the architecture easy to implement and the performance and scalability to be superb.<P>Incidentally, the support from the author and publisher are excellent as well. When I had a question about the subject matter in the book, I e-mailed the author. I received a personal reply from Mr. Lhotka, with a detailed answer to my question, in just a couple of days.</span>

                    <span>I had read most the the original VB6 Business Objects book and liked the content but didn't like the way object state was handled. This book takes the original concept and builds on it to a point that you can make some very nice reusable, scalable objects. <P>This is a must for any serious VB object developer.</span>

                    <span>Okay, so this is an excellent book. I am a distributed applications expert and I am very familiar with several distributed architectures. I even had the opportunity to sit down in a private meeting with the author to learn and discuss his ideas. The first thing I would like to say is that Rocky's CSLA architecture is by far one of the most rock solid systems I have seen today...<P>BUT...<P>People are implementing this in horrible horrible ways. I now pretty much have a career of going around to various companies and correcting the awful implementations of the CSLA arhcitecture. The problem? Programmers are implementing distributed architectures in applications that don't need them. Often, total beginners are using this advanced architecture to build tiny little webpage apps that would work fine with traditional approaches.<P>If you are an experienced programmer, needing guidance on the development of a MASSIVELY scalable application with thousands of users, then this is the book for you. If you are beginner or intermediate programmer wanting to implement this architecture in some little project just for the sake of saying you made a distributed application, keep doing it!!! I need the money!</span>

                    <span>A clear and concise method of deploying rock solid VB6 business objects. An excellent follow up to his VB6 Business Objects book. Rocky has done an excellent job explaining and demonstrating how to design and develop distributed VB objects. I have applied the author's methods on a number of applications. I highly recommend this book.</span>

                    <span>I read a lot of books in VB but THIS one is necessary for all professional developer. It's an expert book, so don't search for a lot of user interface code in it. It's all about engine under the hood. A MUST. I don't consider buying this book if it's your first start in VB. Try Beginning Object and Businness Object before this one.</span>
