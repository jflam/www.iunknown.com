                    <span>Ernst Wildi is a consummate professional who has a unique ability to teach through his writings and demonstrate fundamental concepts of art and photography. Wildi is admittedly a proponent of Hasselblad camera equipment, yet he goes to great pains to be as generic as possible in presenting his beliefs in techniques, equipment, and that's the point of the book. This book would benefit anyone contemplating serious photography, or those contemplating the plunge into medium format films and equipment. Anyone considering "thinking square" should buy this book. Wildi presents the comparisons of ideas in such a way as to challenge the reader to think and see differently. The reader can only guess what equipment and format was used, and the serious amateur will puzzle over the images and ask "how did he do that in 6x6?" Did he? <P>The diagrams and technical explanations are presented in a lucid way, and not baffling. The photographs are very well-done, but Wildi never disappoints from my experience! Yes, I'm a Wildi fan because his teaching style always pleases me and in a distant way, he has become a great reference even though I'm not currently a Hasselblad devotee. Wildi uses the camera system as a tool to create beautiful images, and this book reflects his craft and ideas!</span>

                    <span>Ernst Wildi is a consummate photographer, loves Hasselblad and its native format, and any aspiring medium format photographer should read this book with an open mind. Wildi's work is exemplary. Most of his concepts are readily adaptable to any film format, so he focuses on equipment, films, prints and digital issues in a generic way. He is admittedly biased toward Hasselblad, yet the 6x6 format is so flexible, the concepts are presented in a comparative way and the reader has a difficult time determining which format is used. Beautiful! Wildi, therefore, tries to get the reader to open up to concepts and approaches to visual situations and "see" differently. In other words, ponder the possibilities! The author does cover various equipment necessities and many fundamentals of "how-to" deal with certain situations. This book does deal with certain technical issues in an understandable, yet technical way. The book is not thick, and has many, well-done pictures and diagrams. I will confess to being a Wildi fan. His writings and ideas have been an inspiration to me, and anyone contemplating an investment in "thinking square" will find his concepts educational, no matter the equipment used. Buy this book!</span>
