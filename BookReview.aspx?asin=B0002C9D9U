                <span id="Label1">Like <I>The Passion of the Christ</I>, <I>Luther</I> is the story of a spiritual leader, German monk Martin Luther (Joseph Fiennes), in opposition to the religious orthodoxy of the time (in his case, the 1600s). His goal--to bring God to the people and to take money, fear, and shame out of the equation--made him a reformer to some, a heretic to others. Released around the same time as Mel Gibson's blockbuster, it failed to attract the same degree of attention--or controversy. Granted, it's a different film, but not radically so. Directed by Eric Till (<I>Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace</I>), <I>Luther</I> isn't always easy to follow or as emotionally involving as it could be. That said, it's a fascinating story and Fiennes receives solid support from Alfred Molina (<I>Frida</I>), Bruno Ganz (<I>Wings of Desire</I>), and the late Sir Peter Ustinov (<I>Spartacus</I>), in his final film role, as Frederick the Wise. <I>--Kathleen C. Fennessy</I></span>

                    <span>I am very pleased with how this movie was made.  The sound track is awesome and the story remains almost completely accurate.  (There are some minor points upon which liberties were taken).  Many directors would have taken a lot of liberties and so I expected this film to be inaccurate on many accounts.  In watching the film I was proven and it is only in accurate upon two points which were changed for the sake of the film and have no bearing on the truths upon which Luther based his faith nor the doctrine which he taught.
<br />
<br />The only that I found wrong with this movie was that it was a little to hard to understand.  However, that may be because I am a Bible college student and I have just finished a class on Christian doctrine.  Different people will watch this at different levels.  Having studied Luther, I probably am more familiar with his life and doctrine than the average person.  As I was watching the movie I was looking for certain events.  For instance his debate in which he denied the Apocrypha as canonical.  This may be why I was a confused.</span>

                    <span>First off - anyone who has stuidied church history (no, I'm not referring to the revisionist garbage being promulgated) knows that Martin Luther, was Anti-catholic. He started out as Catholic monk, who discovered for himself, that salvation is NOT through the Roman Catholic Church, Mary, the Pope, good deeds, etc...rather, through placing one's faith in what Jesus Christ did for us on the cross. This is what marked Luther as a "heretic" to the Roman church. Sadly and ironically, our society sees and "lumps" all of Christianity into a "Catholic" wrapping. Catholocism never has, and never will be Christianity. </span>

                    <span>Luther is a complex and often muddy movie, with unfulfilled potential worthy of a ten hour trilogy at least. It is worth seeing despite having many of its charactarizations unclear and its action, condensing 25+ years of history, very sketchy.
<br />
<br />Martin Luther (Joseph Fiennes), a young 16th century German lawyer becomes so frightened of death that he bargains with the Deity, taking vows as a monk. He takes his bargain seriously; the movie sketches his spiritual growth, with his political struggles equally poorly explained. As he becomes more educated in the Bible he finds the established Church full of hypocrasy and seeks to reform it but we see little of the process of how it became corrupt and how either side actually got to where they must go. We only see hints of the mind driving Martin Luther's inner struggles and the external processes goading it onward.
<br />
<br />As Martin Luther is drawn closer to his schism he is supported by his patron Friedrich, Prince of Saxony, beautifully played by Peter Ustinov and thwarted by a confusing host of others. 
<br />
<br />I think this movie is most flawed by its modernisms. Luther's confessor, Fr. Johann von Staupitz (Bruno Ganz) comes across as a stereotypal Obi Wan Konobi, spiritual in a vague way but not understandable, while Pope Leo XII (Uwe Ochsenknecht) seems a parody of Bill CLinton out boar hunting with his buddies. It is also flawed by its half explained historical parallels. For instance we wonder why the selling of dispensations remind us so much of modern protestant televangelism and we get no explanation why Andreas Karlstadt's (Jochen Horst) socialistic perversion of Luther's teachings which results in the deaths of a hundred thousand peasants is so reminiscent of modern Latin American wars.
<br />
<br />Perhaps most irking is the fact that Katharina von Bora (Claire Cox), Martin Luther's wife and the love of his life, has to bravely endure an entirely trivial role.
<br />
<br />On its positive side, Luther shows rich detail of costume, properties and mileau. Peasants are believable down to the last snotty nose and bovine grin. This visual detail and the absolute beauty of the sound track would salvage a much worse film.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>Well-crafted and gorgeously-costumed, "Luther" depicts the main events in the evolution of Martin Luther, from self-lacerating Augustinian monk to the scourge of all things Roman Catholic. A devout RC myself, I was surprised how watchable and re-watchable the film is. It more-or-less fairly depicts the characters of the day, from Pope Leo X to John Tetzel. The film does a great job of translating into action what is generally a work of the mind: the mainly theological arguments and objections that Luther had to the "works" that were part-and-parcel of Catholic medieval piety. Catholics might be surprised at the reasonableness of Luther's issues with the Church, while Protestants might be surprised at the blood that was spilled on account of this man.
<br />
<br />I did object to some of the characterizations. Joe Fiennes played Luther with a gentleness that was not Luther's strong point. I also doubted Sir Peter Ustinov's take on Prince Frederick of Saxony -- the cutely cunning old monarch -- a recurring role in Ustinov's later work. Frederick was a man who nearly single-handedly fended off the Roman Church, which was dying to get its hands on Luther. And Albert Molina's John Tetzel was tepid and warm-hearted, in his way -- not at all the fiery orator who raked in the scads of indulgence money and scandalized the faithful with his blasphemous claim to be able to pardon even the man who violated the Mother of God herself. On the other hand, Bruno Ganz's depiction of Luther's Augustinian abbot was nuanced and versatile. His scenes were the most dramatic of the film.
<br />
<br />No question, the movie (underwritten by a Lutheran insurance company) was meant to be sympathetic to Luther. It spun Luther's story into a classic Hollywood tale  -- the humble man of the earth, naively seeking to reform a hopelessly corrupt and cynical organization. The film ill serves history, however, as the real Luther was a different beast altogether. The film also downplays Luther's violent side, depicting him horror at having sanctioned the princes to shed so much blood in the Peasants' Rebellion. But the Luther of history wrote these words: "Let everyone who can, smite, slay, and stab, secretly or openly, remembering that nothing can be more poisonous, hurtful, or devilish than a rebel." It's a shame the film tried to whitewash the truth.
<br />
<br />In spite of its flaws, the movie brilliantly brings to life the contradictory times of the 16th century, giving us images on which to hang future studies of the man who faced down the mightiest power of his time. Worth 3 stars, I awarded an extra star on account of the film's craft, re-watchability and suitability as a teaching tool.</span>

                    <span>I have two sons, ages 13 and 16.  Last year we went to see the film "Luther" at the theater.  We were captivated by the reality of the story and the overwhelmingly human portrayal of this man's life and times. Luther is portrayed as; genuinely human, genuinely distrubed by the spiritual battle raging within him,   overwrought with the agony of living up to all the rules and regulations of the Catholic Church, and by the sight of poor people being required to pay to be forgiven, etc....  The compassion and compulsion of Luther is clearly conveyed in this film.  The reasons for his actions are clearly depicted in the unveiling of his story.  My sons and I have been affected by what we witnessed in this film.  We have waited with great anticipation for the release of "Luther" onto DVD, so we could again witness the heroic life of a common man.</span>
