                <span id="Label1">There's good news and bad news. That's the inside scoop on the state of journalism from <i>Washington Post</i> editors Leonard Downie Jr. and Robert G. Kaiser, whose book <I>The News About the News</I> sheds light on the changes wrought on the profession during the late 20th century. Using the clear, sharp prose emblematic of their craft, the authors examine the effects of changing business standards, the merger of news and entertainment, and--of course--the Internet explosion on how reporting is produced and consumed. Their verdict is that thoroughly researched, unbiased stories on vital topics not only provide a public service but also will sell papers and commercials. This is, of course, a welcome call to arms for reporters, editors, readers, and viewers to demand higher-quality work from news providers. It's hard to find flaws in their arguments; though they are mildly print-chauvinistic, they recognize the problems of their own medium just as much as radio, TV, and the Web. Readers of <I>The News About the News</I> will find themselves better able to evaluate journalism and, perhaps, to help create a demand for good news. <I>--Rob Lightner</I> </span>

                    <span>This book made me mad. It showed how truely twisted and money driven most of the newspaper and television companies are. It also made me mad because I can never watch network news on television again. I used to enjoy the 10:00 news. Stories of  crime, killer bees, and Arnold Schwarzenegger were facinating, and I thought, valid uses of news time. Turns out these kinds of stories are meant to attract viewers, not inform them. <p>This book had to be written. As a young person, the only news my peers seem to be interested in is who is dating who in Hollywood. I understand that this information might be interesting, but it is not news! What I love about this book is that it is written by two people who know what they are talking about. The authors are both journalists for the Washington Post (one of the few newspapers that still has a high standard of news). They have both years of experience and numerous facts to back up their ideas.  <p>More people should read this book to realize what to expect, and hopefully demand, from news.</span>

                    <span>I am generally disgusted with the way that news is reported in today's news market.  "The News About the News" touched several good points as to why most of our society feels this disturbed rejection to the papers that are thrown on our porches each morning.  Written by two editors from the acclaimed Washington Post, both with almost fourty years of journalistic experience, this is no attempt by a green author to turn an old argument into a paycheck.  Yet, although their approach to explaining their viewpoints on the decline of investigative reporting, and good public service was informative - the news about their profession was never conclusive.  Not one point was made which outright stated what should be done with a declining audience in today's market.  The last few points were along the lines of a transition into the age of new technology, and what the impending effect would have on how news is handled.  There were some great points made in reference to huge corporations mishandling the news that we view, in order to make a better profit for their stockholders... but these points and the handful of others could have been made in less pages.  Instead, the spin cycle of reapeated premises and dry view points wore on again and again till the last sentence.  What does the public want?  An answer, and a better journalistic approach to todays news in foreign, domestic and investigative reporting.  Yet as was discussed in the book we aren't going to see this until the business of the news comes out of the clouds from making profits and floats back into the reality of public service.</span>

                    <span>Downie and Kaiser are veteran newspapermen with a very experienced perspective on the business of news, and they prove in this book that the current situation isn't so good. Journalism is in a sorry state due to modern trends of money grubbing and media fragmentation. Increasing absentee corporate ownership of newspapers and TV networks has led to an obsession with short-term profitability, with reporters and editors being forced to focus on lowest-common-denominator topics like entertainment and consumer news. This might help profit margins now, but damage journalistic quality so badly that the health of the news business is in a downward spiral. Another problem is inaccurate market research by consultants who know little about the business, leading to the unproven perception that the public wants less substance and more convenience. The real evidence proves otherwise, and media outlets think that giving people what they want is more useful than giving them what they need. The authors also prove the near uselessness of most local TV newscasts, which have become enslaved by pressure from advertisers, and are prone to "action" news that is photogenic but informationally useless. <p>The authors tend to heap an annoying amount of praise on their employer, the Washington Post, although that paper deserves its reputation as one of the nation's best. They also fail to look into non-establishment and alternative media outlets (sticking mostly to newspaper, TV, and a little bit of cyberspace), while the later chapters of the book become a repetitive summary of points that were proven long before. However, the insights into the poor health of the news business are very illuminating and even a little scary, because the most successful democratic society should be a well-informed one. But the recent decline in journalistic integrity is not necessarily a permanent trend and it can even be reversed. The best evidence is in the aftermath of 9/11, as the hunger for real in-depth knowledge awakened in the American public, and the news business finally realized that the public was smarter than they assumed all along. Time will tell if the downward trend in quality will reverse itself over the long term, but for the meantime Downie and Kaiser have created an expose that should lead to much self-examination in their field.</span>

                    <span>Two veteran reporters of the Washington Post have pooled their talents to produce "The News about the News".  Leonard Downie, Jr. and Robert Kaiser provide a detailed analysis of the problems with news today and how it got into the current condition.  They take the position that the news used to be about good journalism but today the emphasis is on making a profit.  How does one make a profit in the media business?  Well the surest way is to make it entertaining.  Could this be why there is a minimum of international reporting in the news today and an expansive reporting of the social life of celebrities?  Downie and Kaiser argue persuasively that it is.  When the focus is on increasing shareholder value then the method is to increase subscriptions or viewer share.  The way to do this is to provide information that the purchasers or viewers want to see.  <p>The whole situation reminds me of a conversation with a history book publisher when he was asked about the fact that the history book for middle school students had so many errors he stated that they are in the business to sell books and not to supply correct history texts.  School Boards generally have parents that help select the textbooks for the system to use and so they print history the way the parents want it portrayed.  It does not matter if it is correct, what matters is that it is accepted by as many schools as possible.  This seems to be somewhat the same attitude of today's news media.  While what they state may or may not be correct, it is often highly biased and hard news is often left out in favor of news of minimal value.  Apparently the current direction of news is to entertain more than it is to inform.<p>Downie and Kaiser make a point that unbiased, hard reporting will also sell papers and increase viewers.  There are people who want a complete picture of the news and they will tune in to a news broadcast that is less entertainment and more informational.  They note that fewer and fewer people are tuning into the news as the broadcasters scramble to try to increase their market share of a declining pool.  What they don't note is the effect that things like cable television have had.  I know many, many people who have come to tune into the BBC News Channels so that they can get a decent news broadcast and actually know what is going on in the world.  Perhaps the pool of people who are watching the news is increasing, but the group of people who watch it for entertainment purposes is decreasing.  <p>"The News about the News" is a recommended read for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at the news or a brief survey of how news has changed over the last twenty years.  Well written in a style that is easy to read it is sure to dismay those still naive enough to think that the news is reported in an unbiased and complete manner.  But the authors hold out hope that as the media realizes that it can also make money with hard-hitting and informational news it may start the pendulum swing back to good journalism.  We can all certainly hope so.</span>

                    <span>As a journalism student, I feel that this book fully explains how the news industry works, highlighting many examples from both print and broadcast journalism.  However, sometimes the authors gave too many examples about certain issues, making the information redundant.  I also felt as if there were too many references to Sept. 11th.  While that date was a key date in history for excellent reporting, the authors make many references to it in different places throughout the book.  Perhaps they should have simply dedicated a chapter to it instead of incorporating it into many.  Overall, the book was interesting to read, just redundant at times.</span>
