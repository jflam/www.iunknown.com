                    <span>Foxwold (his review is above mine), gave no stars to this book but I give it one. Ultimately, I think Foxwold is right that the author doesn't appear to really be an enthusiast about the history of spices. 
<br />
<br />The book is not a comprehensive view of the subject by any means, but I would still enjoy the it as a whole had it mitigated against the normal 'dry' result of reference works by being an interesting read. Dalby doesn't manage to do this at all... The style of writing is not nicely flowing and the way in which the information is organized is sterile and uninteresting. I gave him one star because I learned a FEW interesting things while reading it but ... if I am not looking at an encyclopedia or a reference text, then I want my reading material to be stimulating too.</span>

                    <span>Clearly, the author didn't have those who's interest is in the culinary use of spices in mind as an audience. One of my degrees is in history, I'm used to sorting through dry tomes for nuggets of fact, but didn't find anything useful here.  May I suggest that before taking it on, the reader will want to obtain an excellent historical atlas, and a detailed botanical guide, it's the only hope one has of following along.  My interest is in recreation of historically accurate recipes, but found myself sadly disappointed by the lack of reference to flavors, and a great many spices popular in medieval Europe missing entirely.<p>The author is clearly fascinated by ancient documents for their own sakes, and a linguist. Unfortunately for me, I'm interested in spices for their own sakes. This is scholarly enough that by page 25 I was convinced I was reading a doctoral dissertation, by page 35, I was questioning the editor's judgement.  This is a stunningly dull book.  Of the 200 or 300 culinary reference books I've purchased over the past 10 years, this is ONLY disappointment.  It is quite functional as an insomnia cure, however.</span>

                    <span>I learned a lot from this book, and I showed it to a teacher in culinary arts, and she was very impressed. Andrew does wonderful research, as one might expect from a librarian, but he writes well as well.</span>
