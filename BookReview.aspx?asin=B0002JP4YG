                    <span>This is not history.  It's nonsense.  The Corps of Discovery went out to establish U.S. claims to trade.  It was not a particularly noble trip, it was not pure exploration, it had devastating effects for the tribes contacted.  Where are the descendants of Clark?  Why aren't they in this film?
<br />They are out there.  I've heard them speak at many conferences.  Where is Sacagawea's family? They are still around.  Why aren't their views represented?  What about descendants of other members of the Corps?  What of the theft of canoes at the western-most point of the trip (by L&C from the Native Americans living in the region)?  What of Charbonneau's abuse of S.? He beat her so badly that three times it was entered into the official record of the trip.  An official government record.
<br />What of the maps that L&C brought with them? What of the French traders already in the area they subsequently claimed for the U.S. based on being the "first" in the area?
<br />
<br />For a more interesting view of the Expedition I recommend the video of Johnny Arlee's pageant titled: Salish and Pend d'Oreille People Meet the Lewis and Clark Expedition"
<br />This presents a different and more enlightening view of the Corps.</span>

                    <span>Ken Burns has pulled me into this story like nothing else could have.  This presentation combines stories told in a most compelling way, readings from the journals, pictures and paintings, and music in a way that makes the Lewis & Clark expedition come alive.  It's an adventure story that transcends time.  I was so blown away when I first saw it on PBS that I bought the book, the VHS video, and now the CD/book combo.  I am watching it now for the 10th time, and I still cry when I get to Grinder's Stand.  My son is now writing a report on Lewis and Clark for school, and he is using this DVD as his primary source.  He chose the topic, and it's one of the few stories that has captured his attention other than Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.  (Thank you, Ken Burns!)  This is a real-life adventure story that is expertly told.  (I would love to get the soundtrack that PBS used to sell, but they apparently no longer sell it.)</span>

                    <span>The expedition of Lewis & Clark is one of the great events in American History and is all but unknown today.  This wonderful program is a great way to become more familiar with this fascinating story and that great band of explorers (including the woman on our Golden Dollar: Sacagawea).  Hal Holbrook is a great narrator and the writing is quite good.  The visuals are even better.  It is stunning to view and brings some real appreciation to what the Corps of Discovery accomplished.  Just taking that boat upstream for so many miles is stunning, let alone all the cataloging they did in the face of a very real struggle for survival.  <p>It is also amazing to see how many vistas Burns and crew were able to find in such a seemingly pristine state.  One of the real shocks to me was to understand how nearly deadly the Great Plains were to the Corps because of the lack of wood.  Growing up in Michigan with trees everywhere, we take wood for granted.  On that expedition, its lack was a real hardship.<p>While not as dramatic as war and without and the lack of contemporary illustrations requires a different presentation style than Burns normally provides, this is still a visual feast and good solid food for the brain.  Worth viewing many times for many reasons.<p>Don't forget to read Stephen Ambrose's "Undaunted Courage" as well.</span>

                    <span>I bought this video as a gift, and so far Amazon had sent me two defective copies.  Neither copy will play all the way through on any DVD player we have tried.  The problem on both is shortly before "The Portage" begins.  I have never had a problem with any other DVD, so I was extremely surprised that PBS Video has failed twice.  I would love to be able to give this gift permanently, as the narrative is interesting, and the scenery is beautiful, and I would otherwise give 5 stars.  Amazon's customer service also deserves some of the star deductions. I've never had to test the return policies of any other DVD distributors.</span>

                    <span>More than a historical account of the Lewis & Clark expedition, this is a moving portrait of the journey and its participants.  The music--as in all of Mr. Burns' productions--echoes the story, and Mr. Holbrook's narration is without peer.  Most heart-wrenching of all is the recounting of Meriwether Lewis' post-expedition mental decline and suicide.  I cannot say enough about this show:  I've seen it on PBS at least twice, and doubt I'll ever tire of it.</span>
