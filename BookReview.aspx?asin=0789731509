                <span id="Label1"><p>The new Microsoft Certified Desktop Support Technician (MCDST) credential proves that you have the skills to successfully support end users and successfully troubleshoot desktop environments running on Windows XP. MCDST candidates must pass two core exams (70-271 and 70-272). The 70-272 exam, when combined with the 70-271 (the operating system exam for desktop support technicians), validates that a candidate can successfully answer (or escalate) all calls from end users. The <i>MCDST 70-272 Exam Cram 2</i> gives readers the essential information they need to know to pass the 70-272 exam, which includes configuring and troubleshooting applications (Internet Exporer, Outlook Express), resolving issues related to usability, resolving issues related to application customization, configuring and troubleshooting connectivity for applications, and configuring application security. This book can be used as a sole study guide for those experienced with Windows XP or it is the perfect supplement guide for more comprehensive training materials, instructor-led classes, and/or computer-based training.</p></span>

                    <span>This book provides a good high level overview of the material. The main shortcoming is that it makes statements like "make sure you know this or that" but doesn't explain or provide examples. I took the test and passed, but don't think this book contributed a lot to my success. This book is worth a read, but don't rely on it.</span>

                    <span>The book had a lot of useful information, however it did not really go indepth on any of the subjects. I wish the book had given more examples or details on the topic. It provided only 145 questions, compared to other books for the test that provided over 300. I gave the book 3 stars because it is a useful study guide that can fit into my purse so I can take it everywhere. I would suggest reading something more in depth first.</span>

                    <span>I read the book over the weekend to brush up on my skills and to get an idea of what the test would be like. As I went through the book I also did the quizzes at the end of each chapter and missed only 3-4 questions out of the entire book (100+ questions) so I was feeling pretty confident. <P>I then installed the CD and took the test and failed with a 60%! The CD has a lot of questions that are in a different format than that of the actual test. (At least according to what I have read in the Microsoft MCDST newsgroup). A person literally has to memorize the steps and pull-down menus of applications to pass the disk based test. The CD is provided by MeasureUp so the questions are entirely different than what is found in the book.<P>I took the exam and passed with flying colors! However there were a number of topics on the test that were NOT in this book including: VPN error messages, and some Word and Excel stuff.<P>(I give it 4 stars because of the CD).</span>
