                    <span>While working on my math degree I wanted some light reading on Graph Theory for completing some side projects.  This book hit the spot, and the examples saved me.  <p>Chartrand uses applications from every field of interest (e.g. finance, Chemistry, Physics, games, social psychology, computers, etc.)  Who would have thought that while reading a math book that a friendly discussion of social psychology would pop-up?  Well, that's how Chartrand is able to keep us moving through the pages; he uses the common to reveal the mysteries of Graph Theory. Who doesn't know about the Tower of Hanoi or the Knight's Tour or the one-boat-fox-and-chickens problems? All of these classics make for ready connecting points, leading us into profound restatements of well-known problems.  Not much space is devoted to creating artificial problems for which we must be convinced need solving, and so the book is rather thin (a real bonus for those of us who don't want to spend a month in a math book).<p>Picking up the book after having read it so long ago, I was happy to find that the chapters are nearly autonomous and can be profitably read by themselves -- so keep it as a reference and jump in as the need arises, you'll be both entertained and mathematically illumined.<p>My only complaint is that the writing style is rather thick with mathematical lingo (seemingly) for the sake of being technically pithy.  I am not convinced that such is necessary for a good math book.</span>

                    <span>This book is excellent, especially if you already have a pretty good background in math.  I don't... high school math through calculus, almost all of which I've forgotten.  But the appendix gets you up to speed on the basics of sets, functions, and proofs using mathematical induction.  That was enough for me to get a lot out of all but the last chapter, which deals with matrices and groups.  Although I have to admit that I occasionally needed to read an example four or five times before I really got it.<p>I definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in graph theory and to any serious software developer (which I why I picked it up).  The ideas presented are directly applicable to that line of work.</span>

                    <span>Most books assume that the reader has a month to carefully read the book.  In reality, the reader often has a day or two and needs a solid understanding of the material but not a really detailed understanding.  This book is great because it quickly and clearly covers all of the necessary concepts.  What else can you ask for?</span>

                    <span>This was the text used in my undergraduate introduction toGraph Theory. It is quite good, and cheap!  It is the perfect text toget the flavor of the subject and spark interest in students to learn more. For a Prof. looking for an idea for a summer course, or an oppertunity to teach to non-math majors who need an upper level course, this is perfect.  END</span>
