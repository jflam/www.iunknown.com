                    <span>The best part about this book is that besides all of the neat tricks it gives you, the layout is step-by-step. You can sit down with it using the CD and go through each exercise. I have recommended this book to all of my friends/co-workers that are either learning how to protect software they write to how to identify vulnerabilities in other programs. Knowing assembly helps, but this also presents it in a way that you can learn as you go.</span>

                    <span>Copy protection schemes are to software as locks are to doors: they keep honest people out.  This book provides the first insight into the science of disassembling object code for the reader who has been disinclined to search for hacker web sites and zines.
<br />
<br />With a topic this large, the author can be forgiven for presenting only a limited set of examples: C, C++, Pascal on Windows.  He shows how to use commercial tools to disassemble object code into assembler and how to identify program structures there, with particular emphasis on language features that produce non-intuitive structures.
<br />
<br />Topics covered include: cracking passwords, identifying key structures in high level languages (the bulk of the book) and how to make your code difficult to analyse using these methods.
<br />
<br />The structures examined include IF-THEN-ELSE, SWITCH-CASE-BREAK, objects, structures, arrays, constants, offsets and variables.  The reader is shown how to recognise these objects.  Explanations are complete and involve no handwaving.
<br />
<br />A good solid introductory text. </span>

                    <span>I thought this was a pretty good book. First, to the 'reviewer' (in quotes since he didnt read the book beyond the very beginning) -- very little of the book makes any use of softice. The tool mostly used is Interactive Disassembler (a commercial tool available from datarescue) but any disassembler will do.
<br />
<br />The book is about the code typically generated by compilers of various forms (mostly c and c++, some pascal as well). If you want to understand the disassembly, you must grok what Christina Cifuentes calls idioms (instruction sequences that have an effect different than the usual intended meaning).
<br />
<br />This book is very much a collection of idioms. It's a good primer to the art of reverse engineering, and maybe readers can move on to general decompilation papers for further study, starting with "Reverse Compilation Techniques" by Ciguentes, and moving on to more modern papers.
<br />

                    <span>First, you should probably familiar yourself with assembly programming before you read this book.  It will accelerate the learning progress greatly.<p>The first three sections of this book were great.  However, I had a no luck getting SoftICE to run correctly on Windows XP.  I browsed some online forums and noticed other people with the same problem.  Since it appeared that the vast majority of the rest of the book relied on the use of SoftICE, I put the book down and never returned.<p>It was also a pain getting some of these old hacker utilities the author used.  I didn't even manage to get them all.  Author, please put them online or give us a clue!<p>Also, some brief examples of some Linux application alternatives would have been appreciated.</span>
