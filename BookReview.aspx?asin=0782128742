                <span id="Label1">Whether you class yourself as just a beginner or have long been a lover of Borland's much-acclaimed object-oriented development tool, <I>Mastering Delphi 6</I> has plenty to offer you. Written by world-renowned Delphi expert Marco Cant&#249;, this edition, marking the release of Delphi 6, continues the tradition of excellence, balancing attention to detail with the author's unfussy, very readable style, which makes this a book that's accessible to all. While you will need an understanding of the basics of Pascal, even that is catered to by the inclusion of an easy-to-understand Pascal tutorial as one of the four bonus "chapters" on the accompanying CD-ROM. The CD-ROM also includes example source code and the full searchable text of the book in Acrobat format.<p>  Much of the introductory material included in previous editions has been removed in favor of plenty of exposure to the enhancements available in Delphi 6. Among others, these include CLX, the new cross-platform component library, dbExpress, the new database engine, and Delphi's extensive support for e-business and Web development. There is also improved coverage of some of Delphi's longer-standing features.<p>  Designed in a tutorial format, this book bristles with practical programming. In all, there are around 300 examples, each one supported by Cant&#249;'s clear explanation of the key skills in view. From the foundations of Delphi's object-oriented class library through to a whole section devoted to building Web applications, no information is left unexplored. If you are looking to lever your skills and harness the power of Delphi 6 for your applications, look no further than this excellent resource. <I>--Peter Lunn, Amazon.co.uk</I> </span>

                    <span>I bought this book to learn Delphi.  I have no prior experience in it.  I am not even 4 pages into the book, and the author is already telling me that he is not going into any details on the basics of Delphi, but instead, is going to focus on enhancements concerning Version 6.  He already assumes I am familiar with the Delphi IDE, and if I am not, I can go to his website and get the information I need.  I went to his website, and it is more confusing than the book (needless to say, I cant find his "step by step instructions on Delphi IDE).  I think this guy needs to jump off of "cloud 9", and step back down into the real world.  I want to learn Delphi, not write a thesis on it, or go off on some intellectual space fantasy into the cosmos.  I just want to learn Delphi!  This book has over 1000 pages, and already assumes you know Delphi!</span>

                    <span>I've read Mastering Delphi 3 and 6 and while Marco Cantu does a good job of exposing Delphi to beginners, his style is VERY lacking when it comes to advanced techniques.  I also feel he is somewhat condescending in his explanation of technical matters and assumes that his reader is a near-complete neophyte (well that could also explain the popularity of his books).  Still, the website complementing his books does show an effort to make it useful and attractive to his audience.<p>Fairly experienced programmer will find that his writing style in the Mastering Delphi series hobbles learning as in the effort to sound more 'friendly' by not adopting deeper technical terms he takes two paragraphs to explain something which a couple of sentences should suffice to.</span>

                    <span>Just got this book the other day.  Not too much of beginners book if you don't know Pascal.  Worthwhile though for Delphi though.  I'll learn the Pascal as I go along.  There are other books for Pascal as well as the authors own website.  Great book so far.</span>

                    <span>I have little to say other than this book is exceptional. All items are well covered and specific emphasis is placed on the latest changes to the Delphi IDE as well as the latest new features in Delphi 6 (which are superb). <p>The code examples are clear, bug free and pertinent to the topic at hand. The author's style of writing is superb. His tone is set at the right level, being both factual and very readable. The moment the book arrived, I couln't put it down.<p>I was a little annoyed that the section on the Pascal language was relegated to the CD, and I felt the section on SQL was sparse (also in pdf format, and on the CD only). However one could validly argue that this book is geared towards the intermediate + level of programmer, and the reader should already be familiar with these topics. <p>Advanced programmers (a status which I have not yet attained) may be disappointed with topics covered in the client/server sections.<p>5 stars, once again Mr Cantu! Strongly recommended for intermediate programmers.</span>
