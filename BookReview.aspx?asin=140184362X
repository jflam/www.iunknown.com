                    <span>I loved this book, this book is diferent of all that I saw, Annesa Hartman teachs Illustrator with the focus on design. Entire book has real design projects, in the first leson we can learn how to draw and edit vector points drawing a real world logo!! Not only squares and balls !
<br />It`s easy to read an to understand a pleasure.

                    <span>A review of Exploring Illustrator CS<br>Overall, I found this to be a very good exercise book for solving technical<br>problems on Illustrator CS.  The step-by-step instructions are clear and easy to<br>follow. Also, the book is well organized and nicely illustrated.  My only<br>nitpick, is that the book could used more color-illustrated pages to demonstrate<br>the color palette. I also found the companion CD to be very useful. On whole, I<br>highly recommend this book to any student who wants a good introduction for<br>learning Illustrator.</span>

                    <span>Annesa's book is a step-by-step book aimed at the Illustrator newbie that doesn't assume some esoteric knowledge of the product. For example, in another Illustrator book, it told me how to create a Template Layer but didn't bother explaining how to work with it. I was lost and a bit miffed! From the first chapter, of Annesa's book you get your feet wet and have a feeling of competency by the time you've finished. Unheard of in most training books. Great CD, too, with lessons and a CAD demo program.</span>

                    <span>Rather than elaborate on long drawn out details,"Exploring Illustrator" by Annesa Hartman immediately gets right to the point with specific "helpful" information. The book dosen't bore you with a lot of jargon before focusing on what you are really interested in learning.</span>

                    <span>The contents of this book was perfectly organized and explained for my technical development needs. Although I have a good deal of experience in a professional capacity with developing digital materials, I do not consider myself as especially artistically inclined or technically intuitive.  Without being condescending and without any unnecessary handholding, Hartman has set up an engaging process to become comfortable and skilled with Illustrator.  It's conveniently developed for the reader to work sequencially at his or her own pace or move around based on personal background knowledge and interest.  The "look" of the book is appealing, and I really appreciated the warm and personable writing tone used by the author.</span>
