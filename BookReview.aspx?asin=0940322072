                <span id="Label1">This volume collects Frederick Crews's two controversial essays on Freud from the <I>New York Review of Books</I>, "The Unknown Freud" and "The Revenge of the Repressed," as well as some of the critical letters provoked by their original publication in 1993 and 1994. In these essays, Crews elaborates upon his belief that "the relatively patent and vulgar pseudoscience of recovered memory rests in appreciable measure on the respectable and entrenched pseudoscience of psychoanalysis." Recovered memory therapy, according to his thesis, is a grossly negative practice that, in turn, has its origins in Freudian assumptions about psychoanalysis--assumptions that Crews charges were based on fraudulent data and intellectual bullying. As the reader responses indicate, these ideas were like a grenade tossed into the center of psychoanalytic culture, made all the more powerful by Crews's lively prose.</span>

                    <span>This devastating book has two parts: (1) The Unknown Freud, where the reader gets a picture of Freud as a dictator, a megalomaniac and egotripper. A pope who alone knew the truth and who founded a secret commission to protect his 'church' against the heathen. He was a bad psychoanalyst (e.g. the Wolf Man case) and a venal man (e.g. the catastrophic Horace Fink case, where he tried to get his own hands on some money of the heiress).<br>I agree with the author that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience - statements cannot be tested and the research results cannot be verified uniformly. Although it is not totally without meaning (Karl Popper), it is not a science.<br>(2) the revenge of the repressed<br>A frontal attack on the caste of the psychoanalysts, depicted as 'religious zealots, self-help evangelists, sociopolitical ideologues, and outright charlatans who trade in the ever seductive currency of guilt and blame, while keeping the doctor's fees mounting.'<br>The author is particularly severe with their latest 'school' : the 'recovered memory movement', based on the rape of children by their parents (really!). This lead to false accusations and condemnations of innocent people. No wonder the author predicts an accelerating collapse of psychoanalysis as a respected institution.<br>A much needed and courageous book to halt a profession riding at full speed on a misty highway. And a much needed angle on Freud as a person, written in a style to slaughter the not so innocent father of psychoanalysis.<br>After reading this book, I agree with Peter Madawar, who called doctrinaire psychoanalytic theory "the most stupendous intellectual confidence trick of the twentieth century".</span>

                    <span>Frederick Crews really knows how to tap that deep reservoir of hostility found in modern Freudian psychoanalysts. In 1993 and 1994 FC wrote two essays in the New York Review of Books debunking Freud in the first, and tearing to shreds the recovered memory movement in the second. <p>These two essays and the letters in response to them have been put into the book The Memory Wars. As someone trained in experimental psychology you can guess my own personal bias in this matter. Crews discusses Freud's botched cases; his frequent vacillation in theory formation; some of his sillier theories; and his serious interjection of personal bias into the formation of his beliefs. The main problem with the whole Freudian system is the total lack of scientific evidence supporting it. Freudian psychoanalysis is founded on anecdote and supported by anecdotes. To be fair, much current non-Freudian therapy is also based on anecdote. Indignant Freud followers write back, and their letters are indeed interesting (and often pompous).<p>The second half of the book takes on the recovered memory movement. It would be great to poke fun at this movement if it weren't for the fact that it has caused so much damage to all parties involved. Symptoms checklists are published with the statement if you suffer from these symptoms you may be a victim of sexual abuse. Read the list and you will find that the majority of Americans will find that they have been abused. It's all a patient seduction game with the intent to make big money. Hospitals have even set up units to treat such patients (Having worked in the psychiatric hospital industry I am well aware of the "product lines" that such facilities set up in order to fill beds). Crews does an excellent job of dissecting the memory movement, and once again we get to read the indignant responses.<p>Those who believe that psychological therapy should be based on sound scientific evidence will love this book. Those who have accepted Freudianism with a religious like faith will, of course, hate it. To me this whole subject is analogous to the evolution vs. creationist debate. It's science versus pseudoscience.</span>

                    <span>I have always been a fan of the intellectual debates in the New York Review of Books letters to the editor pages.  This book consists of two articles by Crews and the subsequent debates surrounding them.  I would  have liked to see better defenses of Freud, but none of the eminent  defenders of psychoanalysis is able to mount a serious challenge to Crews's  devastating attacks.</span>

                    <span>For those of you who have swallowed the Freud legend hook, line, and sinker, this book may help get you off the hook.  <p>Seriously, though, this book is not one to miss, regardless of your theoretical beliefs.  <p>For you Freudians, it dispuptes the naive hagiographies of Peter Gay and  Jones, and prepares you to engage in the current battles that rage about  Freud and his ideas. You might not like what it says, but it will challenge  you and force you to more critically evaluate your beliefs. Like it or not,  many of your colleagues and students are now challenging Freudianism, and  the challenge is stiff, indeed. A Freudian needs to be prepared!<p>For  those of you already skeptical of Freud's claims and disconcerted at the  negative sequelae of his theories, this provides a wonderfully cogent  dissection. It is easier to read than some of the other titles in this area  (such as Malcom MacMillon's "Freud Evaluated, the Completed  Arc"), yet covers the ground well. <p>Given the unexamined Freud  worship found in most textbooks and class materials, it is a wonderful  addition to a class textbook (and I use it as such). I highly recommend  this book to all.</span>

                    <span>What is most disturbing about Crews is his intellectual dishonesty in setting up "straw men", especially early ideas of Freud's that Freud himself later modified -- as Crews well knows. (However, it is  possible that Crews is less dishonest than I believe, and merely ignorant.)</span>
