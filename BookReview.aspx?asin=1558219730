                <span id="Label1">If this story of espionage and survival were a novel, readers might dismiss the Shackleton-like exploits of its hero as too fantastic to be taken seriously. But respected historian  David Howarth confirmed the details of Jan Baalsrud's riveting tale. It begins in the spring of 1943, with Norway occupied by the Nazis and the Allies desperate to open the northern sea lanes to Russia. Baalsrud and three compatriots plan to smuggle themselves into their homeland by boat, spend the summer recruiting and training resistance fighters, and launch a surprise attack on a German air base. But he's betrayed shortly after landfall, and a quick fight leaves Baalsrud alone and trapped on a freezing island above the Arctic Circle. He's poorly clothed (one foot is entirely bare), has a head start of only a few hundred yards on his Nazi pursuers, and leaves a trail of blood as he crosses the snow. How he avoids capture and ultimately escapes--revealing that much spoils nothing in this white-knuckle narrative--is astonishing stuff. Baalsrud's feats make the travails in  Jon Krakauer's Mt. Everest classic  <I>Into Thin Air</I> look like child's play. In an introduction,  Stephen Ambrose calls <I>We Die Alone</I> a rare reading experience: "a book that I absolutely cannot put down until I've finished it and one that I can never forget." This amazing book will disappoint no one. <I>--John J. Miller</I></span>

                    <span>One winter, in the midst of WWII, a crew of expatriate Norwegians attempted to land a cargo of guerilla supplies on Nazi-occupied Norway's far-northern coast. This book tells the story of the incredible privation endured by one of those men, Jan Balsruud, his hardihood and survival, and the risks and sacrifices undertaken on his behalf by the men and women who help him evade capture.<P>I first read _We_Die_Alone_ some thirty years ago, in the first paperback edition, and I know that certain of its scenes and events will stay with me so long as I live. Howarth recounts the story simply, and lets the facts provide the drama. <P> Strongly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Second only to Slavomir Rawicz's The Long Walk in the annals of WWII escape stories I've read, the story of Jan Baalsrud's amazing escape after a failed commando insertion into occupied Norway is more a tale of endurance than one of derring-do. Penned by a former British spymaster, the book is a clear, if somewhat simply written, account of how Baalsrud was sheltered for weeks by various patriotic Norwegians who did their best to keep him out of German hands.<P>An expatriate Norwegian, Baalsrud and his fellow commandos were attempting to establish a resistance cell in northern Norway that would disrupt the operations of a major German airfield nearby. Betrayed, the commandos were ambushed by German soldiers, with only Baalsrud escaping. The bulk of the book described how over the next several weeks, regular citizens in remote villages attempted to keep him alive while arranging for him to get to Sweden. This was greatly hampered by the frostbite that made walking or skiing impossible for him. It's an excellent glimpse into the mundane details of how regular people did their best to resist the Germans with the knowledge that they and their families would be killed if their plotting was uncovered.<P>Ultimately though, the book is a tribute to Baalsrud's incredible physical and emotional endurance-he was buried alive for days under snow, left by himself for days at a time unable to move and in excruciating pain, and had to contemplate self-surgery-all while knowing that his discovery could mean the deaths of many innocent people. Think you're tough? Read this and think again! It would have been nice if the publisher had included a map.</span>

                    <span>I rarely bother with adventure stories, but Howarth's fine prose swept me into this tale and kept me at it. The last half of the book I took in one sitting. We hardly care about the protagonist, Jan Baalsrud, as a personality. He has remarkable courage and incredible physical stamina but little spiritual depth. In the hands of a lesser writer, his story could easily have degenerated into a limp survival yarn of the sort regularly published in Reader's Digest. But Howarth gives meaning to the story both through his fine description of the harsh natural world and by his sympathetic treatment of the dozens of volunteers who came to Baalsrud's rescue. Their attempt to rescue one soldier at the risk of their lives became a political as well as a humanitarian cause, virtually the only blow these Norwegians could strike against German invaders in the wastelands of northern Scandinavia.</span>

                    <span>12 men set out in a boat from the Shetland Islands. They are expatriate Norwegians, on a mission to organize, train and supply the Norwegian Resistance against the Nazis. But, they were betrayed, and everything goes horribly wrong. Only one man survives, and it is up to him to complete the mission. He is helped along the way by villagers, who will be shot if they are caught helping him.<P>It's a story of heroism and adventure, and very hard to put down once started. Highly recommended!</span>

                    <span>I'm not a compulsive reader of fantastic true survival stories, though I was raised in the Colorado Rockies and enjoy a bit of moutaineering. But this one was available on tape from the public library.<P>It started with a lot of bullets over the head and exploding boats and boots lost in the snow and frostbite -- many, many good people who risk their lives for something intangible. The book, I feel, is very good at expressing the states of mind of the people involved -- it's not a simple recounting of events.<P>But there's one major event that starts about 2/3 of the way through the book, which was so fantastic that I sort of didn't believe it... until I met two of the people involved in the organization that rescued him. And I think what the fact of that event conveys to me is the power of the human mind -- how much our thought and will do, after all, determine things like whether we live or die. The story has a way of sticking in your mind.<P>One other thing that sticks in my mind about the book concerns the Lapps. It's an odd story. The Norwegians are good skiers and strong people by modern civilized standards (I mean that little itsy country beat the whole world in the winter Olympics). The story relates how they tried several times to get him across the Swedish border, but just couldn't get the sledge that far given the weather and time constraints and geography -- had to keep turning back. They tried to involve the Lapps early on, but they have a fundamentally different approach to such things -- the Lapps among other things, like most nomads leave those who are too weak to travel behind to die in the snow. Then after a month of futility on the part of the Norwegians, a Lapp decide to show up and see if the story was true. Horwath describes how he just stands there for 3-4 hours staring at him in the Arctic snow, and then finally resolves to take him across into Sweden. He and his friend receive some brandy in gratitude, drink several bottles in one night and seem none the worse for it in the morning, and then kind of non-chalantly pull off what the Norwegians could not. That combination of ability to do something what their more sophisticated neighbors could not combined with the lack of sense of urgency interests me.<P>Jan Baalsrud was born and raised in Kapellveien 4, Kolbotn, Oslo, Norway.</span>
