                    <span>I usually steer clear of web site directory books because they become obsolete very quickly. This book presents more than lists of sites. It contains some unusual and even provocative information concerning whether it is preferable to read in hardcopy or online; it also has interviews with people who create content at the freebie sites and this gave me a fresh perspective on the availability of free resources. The best thing is that isn't chock full of screenshots, it's full of information. </span>

                    <span>Build a personal library of information using free web resources with the help of Tomaiuolo's The Web Library: Building A World Class Personal Library With Free Web Resources, edited by Barbara Quint. The Web Library is simply packed with web links and updates, as well as assessments of the pros and cons of given reference sites. Anyone can use no/low cost Web resources to build a comprehensive personal library of data, documents and images: The Web Library outlines keys to locating such gold mines and includes interviews with librarians and leading content providers alike.</span>

As a businessman, I must say that this book was incredibly useful in my many projects and has brought my company's profit up by 3%.</span>

                    <span>I spend a lot of hours searching the web for work.  I bought a copy of this book and it kept disappearing off my desk--borrowed by co-workers.  Now I keep it locked in my desk drawer--they'll have to buy their own copies!  Well done, Nicholas and Barbara!  Hope to see more of your books in print.</span>
