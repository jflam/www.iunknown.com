<h3 class="title">What's the big deal about Safari?</h3>

<p><P>Is it just me, or is <A href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</A> a solution looking for a problem? I've run this browser for a few days on my Mac, and I personally don't see <EM>any</EM> difference in rendering speed when doing side-by-side comparisons with IE. Even if it were faster, I suspect that most of speed difference would be soaked up by network latency.</P><br />
<P>Personally, I look at web browsing as a solved problem. There are far more important and interesting problems to spend engineering dollars on than building yet another web browser.</P></p>

<p>I dont think it's about "new solutions" for Apple, more of a shift to be not as dependant on MS.</p>

<p>Agreed. But I can't help to think that this is pushing MS's buttons in the wrong way. But I can see things from Apple's point of view as well ... I like the fact that Keynote will light a fire underneath the PowerPoint team.</p>

I am guessing it has less to do with MS specifically and generally more to do with the fact that it was a 3rd party that owns the primary browser for their platform.  Email and web browsing are obviously two big chunks, that I am sure they would want to have development control over.  I think "solving the web browsing problem" is just a nessesary step for them to have greater control over their software.  I expect safari will become more integrated with other mac software than they would be able to do with IE.  Branding may have also played a role, cause safari looks more like the other iApps than IE does.</p>

<p>Should we bet on Apple going to court over integrating Safari with other software?</p>

<p>One thing that stands out with Safari is their use of the brushed metal look. According to Apple's own UI guidelines, brushed metal apps are only for non-document oriented applications such as iTunes or iPhoto. However, web browsers are document oriented, so it doesn't really fit into the model.<br />
I agree with Dave's integration observation. Safari gives OS X an integrated HTML parsing engine which is important for developers who want to leverage HTML in their own applications. It would be really nice if they could wrap it as a Cocoa control as well.<br />
As for a lawsuit - I don't think that's likely since Apple controls the entire platform, unlike MS who was caught blocking entry to competitors on a platform that they didn't control completely.</p>

<p>one other thing?  how is enhancing, fixing and repackaging and existing library/product (khtml) a "new solution"?<br />
I would agree with you 100% if they built it from scratch, but taking one of the several opensource html parser/engines and packaging is not a "new solution".  It is intelligent extension/re-use.</p>

<p>The thing that rankles me about Safari is that Apple is making technical justifications as to why they built Safari. Apparently they just can't seem to bring themselves to tell the truth and say that they're sticking it to MS. It would be fun to be a fly on the wall at the post MacWorld meetings in the MS Mac Business Unit </p>

<p>I dont' think that web browsing is a solved problem - and definetly its not sovled by IE. some points for thought<br />
* There's a lot to be said about standard compliance which have not been said yet. also - web standards are always evolving and IE doesn't seem to keep up - mostly because the IE team is busy inventing their own standards.<br />
* Competition is never a bad word, and if by releaseing a new project Apple will force MS to revamp their offerings for the Mac (IIRC IE for mac has not been updated in ell over a year now).</p>
