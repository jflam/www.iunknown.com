                <span id="Label1">Bernard Lewis is recognized around the globe as one of the leading authorities on Islam. Hailed as "the world's foremost Islamic scholar" (Wall Street Journal), as "a towering figure among experts on the culture and religion of the Muslim world" (Baltimore Sun), and as "the doyen of Middle Eastern studies" (New York Times), Lewis is nothing less than a national treasure, a trusted voice that politicians, journalists, historians, and the general public have all turned to for insight into the Middle East.  Now, this revered authority has brought together writings and lectures that he has written over four decades, featuring his reflections on Middle Eastern history and foreign affairs, the Iranian Revolution, the state of Israel, the writing of history, and much more. The essays cover such urgent and compelling topics as "What Saddam Wrought," "Deconstructing Osama and His Evil Appeal," "The Middle East, Westernized Despite Itself," "The Enemies of God," and "Can Islam be Secularized?" The collection ranges from two English originals of articles published before only in foreign languages, to previously unpublished writings, to his highly regarded essays from publications such as Foreign Affairs and The New York Review of Books. With more than fifty pieces in all, plus a new introduction to the book by Lewis, this is a valuable collection for everyone interested in the Middle East.   Here then is a rich repository of wisdom on one of the key areas of the modern world--a wealth of profound reflections on Middle Eastern history, culture, politics, and current events.</span>

                    <span>I have a couple problems with this book, but I will still give it a rating of 5 stars.<P>My first problem is that it doesn't flow particularly well from one chapter to the next. This is because the book is an anthology of various speeches, op-eds, chapters of other books, lectures, and other work over the years, many previously unpublished. I would have appreciated some more commentary from today's point of view on his work done many decades ago. Because it jumps from year to year, subject to subject, it is hard to digest large portions of it at a time. My recommendation would be to provide even just paragraph-long segues from one chapter to the next explaining why he included each chapter and how it all adds up to the grand point he is making.<P>Second, I let someone borrow it, and she declared it boring and refused to plug away to finish it. I will admit, this book is not exactly for beginners on the Middle East, nor is it for people looking for exciting quasi-history or conspiracy theories. It is not pop-history. It is, rather, a subtle and mostly objective look at the history and contemporary affairs of the Middle East over multiple generations, and in such a collection of work, one can glean bits of why the world is how it is today. But don't expect the book to jump out and slap you in the face, arguing from the point of view of an extreme ideologue. If you can't handle it being dry in some places, this is not the book for you.<P>As far as the good things go, the book is a great way to brush up on Middle Eastern history. I've read some of Lewis' other books, and they are also very good. Some of the other ones flow much better than this one, but this one is the one I would recommend to those who want a more comprehensive yet succinct look at the Middle East, because it does cover so many topics.</span>

                    <span>As a reader I have known more than one time in my life that very special pleasure of meeting a book, that lifts one spirit and one's mind, seems to put one in another higher realm entirely, and gives a kind of intellectual joy which certainly must be among life's greatest pleasures. Reading and meeting again the mind of Bernard Lewis in "From Babel to Dragomans" is such a pleasure. <BR> Collected in this work are essays of one of the great intellectual figures of this past half - century. Arguably the world's foremost authority on the Middle East ( and most especially the Ottoman Empire) Lewis in these essays displays not only a vast learning but a civilized and often quietly humorous writing which continually inform and delight. In the title essay he elucidates the concept of the ' dragoman' or ' meturgaman' the translator and in so doing also helps us better understand the way societies which contained within themselves a rich variety of cultures and languages operated . In his remarkable essay " A Taxonomy of Hatred" he gives perhaps the most skilled argument I have ever seen for valuing and considering ' the other'. And this as he analyzes and explains how the instinctual hatred that seems to come to us naturally as primates is refined into something more elegant and deadly in human civilizations. As one who has been involved in the study of the Islamic world for over sixty years he brings a fine sense of the transformations that world has gone through in his lifetime while balancing this against what seem almost inherent cultural patterns these societies cannot free themselves of . His analysis of the distinct identity Iran and Iranian civilization managed to preserve after the Arab onslaught swept aside the ancient cultures of Egypt, Syria and other Mid- East regions too enables us to understand the life- struggle that society is going through today between a narrow Islamic based fundamentalism and a broader richer conception of life and civilization. <BR> The book is divided into three large sections, part one dealing with Past History, part two with what he calls " Current History" and Part Three "About History" In this latter section he makes a defense of the practice and teaching of history. He concludes , "Our education today should be concerned with the development of many cultures, in all their diversity: with the great ideas that inspire them and the texts in which those ideas are enshrined, with the achievements they made possible, and with the common heritage their followers and successors share.<BR> "History is the collective memory , the guiding experience of human society, and we all badly need that guidance" <BR> In this volume Lewis provides that guidance in a continually inspiring and uplifting way. <BR> Who reads this volume will not only read a civilization , but a very great man indeed.</span>

                    <span>Lewis is a phenomenal scholar of the Middle East as historian and linguist. People want a single book, or at least a single author to rely on. Lewis should NOT be the one. <P>Lewis also over generalizes when it is convenient to his agenda and largely ignores over half the Muslim world that is Asian. As an "Orientalist" his tendency to conclude - rather ahistorically - that various things Islamic are implicit essential 'drives' of Islam is picked up by others wanting simple and quick answers and "wisdom".<P>Especially with modern subjects of the last century or two and topics concerning Israel or US Policy his bias is all too apt to become propaganda and lies of omission. Most of the "good" things that he has to write about Islam that might at first appear to contradict this conclusion are about the remote past and classical age of Islam. Even here is easily coaxed into misleading comments like those concerning the Assassins of the Middle Ages as roots of suicide bombers and terrorism.<P>A few examples follow: An essay on the foundations of Israel makes no mention of the King David Hotel, Irgun, Dier Yassin or Israeli terrorism of any kind. An essay on the first Gulf War repeats what are known to be lies about Saddam's readiness to invade Saudi (the US never showed the claimed satellite photos of hundreds of thousands of troops and independent satellite photos showed no such thing) that was the basis for US bases in Saudi. The Iranian revolution would appear to have been planned and managed solely by Khomeni entirely as a Fundamentalist revolution - which we know not to have been the case and which suggests numerous false conclusions. Discussing Islam and the West he somehow overlooks the essential example of Muhammad Ali (one should read Juan Cole's critique of "What Went Wrong?" on line also). The US is not "Imperialist" because Lewis defines the term narrowly while ignoring that the US has bases in 70% of the countries in the world as well as considerable control through the IMF and World Bank. <P>The infamous essay on Muslim "Rage" is simplistic sociology and horrid generalization that makes something specific to a time and place appear to be the essence of Islam exaggerating a tendency beyond recognition and excusing any responsibility of US policy (Huntington and others have made absurd further generalizations from this and it has driven some of US policy - a good example of the non expert relying almost exclusively on a highly slanted Lewis essay). He certainly knows better but leaves a reader thinking that traditionalist and fundamentalist are the same. The screed about attacks on 9-11 were because "they" hate our freedoms and way of life ignores the symbolic selection of the showcase financial and military control targets central to US policies rather than an attempt to take the most lives. Nor do any people organize attacks for such reasons alone. The US has still not seriously examined its policies as motivation for the attacks. Analogous to this is the "clash" argument that totally ignores the economic and military imperatives of US policies as well as any reexamination of the support for Israel. Lewis is not alone responsible for this but has been commonly used by those happy with this approach.<P>Lewis even goes so far - failing the 'laugh' test - as to suggest that the US is a largely impartial broker regarding the Palestinian issue. In doing so he inflates Israeli pride and ignores numerous inconvenient facts. That Israel on a per capita basis gets nearly ten times the US aid of the next country (Egypt) is perhaps not so important as additional favoritism, sharing military information, newer technology, intelligence and support for Israel against the UN and world community with its considerable nuclear arsenal of weapons of mass destruction on land, air, and sea. Nor are Likudniks advising the President an issue for Lewis although Perle even recommended policies of aggression, settlement, and thumbing its nose at the world community. <P>Essays on the very early period tend to be better, the two on the Fatimids are quite good. Reasonable people may disagree but his promoters exaggerate more than a little to call Lewis a national 'treasure' when he may be more a national 'danger'. I'm awed at his knowledge and shocked by his abuse of it.</span>

                    <span>Prof. Lewis once again demonstrates his rare talent for explaining one of the most difficult subjects of world history in clear, lucid language reminiscent of a more literary era. The book is filled with insightful essays describing real episodes, thought patterns, attitudes and customs that have prevailed in the Middle East over the past millenium. As a frequent traveler to the region over the past 4 decades, I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to get a clear picture, uncluttered by neo-liberalism, of the politics and practices of the Islamic world.</span>
