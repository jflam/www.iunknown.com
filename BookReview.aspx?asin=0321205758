                <span id="Label1">Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) for software. It also represents an <I>ideal</I>, incorporating modularity, extensibility, and community. <I>Contributing to Eclipse: Principles, Patterns, and Plug-Ins</I> is therefore significantly more than a book about how to write plug-ins for the Eclipse framework. The book--by software patterns guru Erich Gamma and "extreme programming" exponent Kent Beck--explains how new Eclipse modules should interact with existing software elements, and make themselves further extensible. It also emphasizes the importance of packaging new plug-ins and making them available to others as new Eclipse features. The book's emphasis is on community, and helping the Eclipse project grow and improve.<p>  That said, this book is an excellent how-to guide. Gamma and Beck take the time to carefully detail a couple of model plug-in projects--including the industry-standard Hello World exercise--and take care to explain the highly visual Eclipse development process one step at a time. They don't unleash bushels of source code on the reader, but nonetheless manage to walk the reader through a series of progressively more elaborate extension projects that exercise some of the most exciting parts of the Eclipse framework. As you'd expect from a book involving Gamma, discussion of patterns appears with increasing frequency toward the book's conclusion, enabling the reader to expand on the authors' shared wisdom and understand the Eclipse design better. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to extend the Eclipse development environment--both in the narrow sense of writing code that makes the software do something new, and in the broad sense of participating in the Eclipse community. Specific coverage addresses extension points, markers, perspectives, and help. There's also a guide to the Eclipse architecture, framed as a series of "pattern stories."</span>

                    <span>This book takes you through a tour on plugin development. The main disadvantage of this book is that it is for Version 2 and not Version 3 of Eclipse. Yes you can somehow manage to translate and find your way around. Anyhow this is quite annoying not always successful and maybe one wants to learn more about the special advertised feature of Eclipse 3: rich client platforms. A topic inherently connected to plugin development. Please give us a new version of this book.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>I don't like this book as a book on writing plugins for eclipse for the following reasons:
<br />
<br />1) This book's 'exploratory' approach tries to show you how to search (the hack approach) through the installed plugins for excerpts that you can copy/paste/edit. It would have been more useful if the authors used a 'tutorial' approach that constrains the example to documented basics (many different examples that then integrate/or not).
<br />
<br />2) As expected (and tiring if you have other book from these authors), JUnit integration is the example developed throughout the book. This may satisfy the need for some types of plugins (code oriented plugins), but leaves much to be desired if you want to develop other kinds of tools.
<br />
<br />3) The samples are outdated in 3.0, and the main example won't work/run in 3.0 (even if you download their project source). If you try to follow along, you will quickly be disapointed once you run into that snag. I am sure that under 2.x it works great.
<br />
<br />4) This book is useful as a way of seeing a small example built up. However, because of #3, this all becomes useless once the plugin doesn't 'work'.
<br />
<br />As with most books that cook a long example as a way of teaching, rather than as a way to support other knowledge, much of the time is spent on explaining how to cook things for the example. For me this doesn't work, as I want something focused that instructs me, rather than a evolving code-walkthrough of a particular example. To me this is boring, and has no use after the initial read.
<br />
<br />This book would be great if it was 1/2 as long, and focused on the patterns for the plugins instead, not presume to be an intro to plugin development.</span>

                    <span>"Contributing to Eclipse" is a great read. More importantly, as someone who is in the middle of their first major Eclipse plugin development project, I learned a lot -- even though I've previously read every other available book on the topic. Gamma and Beck take you through the development of a fairly sophisticated plugin, step by step.  Perhaps most welcome, the plugin they develop isn't a syntax-highlighting text editor (an example that's already been done to death,) but a set of tools for running JUnit tests on Java code!
<br />
<br />This is the only book I've seen that discusses testing and Test-Driven Development of plugins, a must for serious plugin developers.  As you'd expect from the developers of JUnit, they use JUnit to test every piece of functionality they add.  Surprisingly, even though you'd expect some confusing in writing about using JUnit to test a JUnit plugin, there's none. Gamma and Beck are both excellent writers, and they know this subject matter inside out.
<br />
<br />A word of warning: this is neither an introduction to nor a reference for Eclipse plugin programming. I don't think I would have gotten nearly as much from this book if I hadn't read "Eclipse in Action" and "The Java Programmer's Guide to Eclipse" first. But if you've gotten beyond the novice level with Eclipse, I guarantee you'll learn something by reading this book.</span>

                    <span>Once you get past the interesting writing style, this is a pretty cool book written by two of the giants in the industry. This is a particularly good book, if you are interested in Eclipse plugin development and JUnit testing. The tutorial is pretty comprehensive and the book example evolves in a natural way. The only downside is that this book is targeted at Eclipse 2.1 rather than 3.0 (which is no wonder given that it predates 3.0 by more than six months). This doesn't really detract from the book because most of the examples are fairly generic and can be made to run in Eclipse 3.0 with minimal effort.</span>

                    <span>.<br>I was fooled by the first few "reviews" of this book.  Its strange how they gave this book a 4-star rating but seem to have been written before the book was released :~<p>This book is poorly written and it seems the author is not used to writing for the purpose of education but rather just wants to show off his example project.<p>Chapter 1 starts off promising but by chapter 2 it starts on about this JUnit testing project and that's all he talks about for the rest of the book.  In fact, I dare you to open any random page and not find the word "JUnit"!<p>Being new to Eclipse I had to go online to find out what the heck JUnit was since he doesn't really explain it but expects the reader knows all about it.  I discovered that JUnit has little to do with actual Plug-in development but despite that, the author makes JUnit the focus of the book and pretty soon the "example" becomes the central focus and Plug-in development takes a back seat.  I started to get really annoyed at about chapter 3.<p>The examples are so focused on the JUnit project that they are virtually useless in any other context and a lot of other important concepts get left out.<p>The flow of the book is clunky and the book takes quite a few huge leaps of logic leaving the poor reader thinking his copy is missing a bunch of pages in the middle.<p>A word to the aspiring programming book writer: Every example in the book should be simple, stand on its own and preferably be reasonably unrelated to the other examples in the book.  Try "what's the minimal example I can give to demonstrate this concept" instead of "lets give a complex example with lots of unlrelated stuff so the reader will think I'm really smart".<p>This book reads like a soap opera as we hold out breath to see how the JUnit project will evolve in the next chapter.  Good grief!<p>This book needs a total makeover by a good editor and someone with some real-world teaching experience.  In all fairness most of the documentation about eclipse is terrible but I hoped this book tried to rise above that.<p>I was very disappointed.</span>
