                    <span>I was once part of a new XP project where the users were very confused as to how to write a user story, having written nothing but detailed requirements their entire lives. The developers, also new to XP, didn't completely comprehend that they were to actually work with and talk to the users to elicit further details. Oh, if only I had had this book then! I would have purchased a copy for every user and every developer! There is a huge mental shift that has to take place when embracing agile methodologies, and Mike Cohn's book is an excellent catalyst for that change, making it a less painful transformation for those players involved. Cohn even spells out each group's responsibilities at the end of every chapter -- there's no ambiguity around who's supposed to do what. There are lots of examples that are easily understood, and the layout provides you with the information you and your team need in a logical sequence. Chapter 4 has a fabulous section called "Story Writing Workshop" that again provides that step-by-step hand-holding that first-timers need. I highly recommend this book. It's an excellent primer on the process of defining requirements in an agile environment.</span>

                    <span>This excellent book is a must-have for anyone on an agile team - developers, testers, business experts, analysts - and for anyone who struggles with requirements, planning, or estimating on any software project.<P>User Stories Applied is easy to read and digest. As the title suggests, its techniques are easy to apply and deliver huge value. Each chapter summarizes developer and customer responsibilities, and has questions whose answers are provided in an appendix. The book is full of real-life, concrete examples, allowing you to learn from the successes and failures of others. <P>This book will give you many tools to help your projects succeed. Just a few of the most valuable topics:<BR>When are user stories too big, too small, too detailed, too general, too open ended, when are they not user stories, and how to correct all these.<BR>Why use user stories.<BR>How to handle requirements for infrastructure, performance, qualitative aspects, UI.<BR>How to ask questions to elicit requirements.<BR>How to cope when you don't have 'on-site customers'.<BR>Practical ways to estimate stories.<BR>Monitoring velocity and progress.<BR>When to keep and when to discard artifacts.<P>Mike explores the differences between stories and other techniques for delivering requirements: IEEE 380, use cases, scenarios. He points out many positive side effects of user stories, such as encouraging participatory design and tacit knowledge accumulation.<P>I particularly like that the book emphasizes the team's responsibility to successfully complete each iteration. I enjoy Mike's illuminating bits of wisdom, such as the "everything takes 4 hours" example. I love the comprehensive example in Part IV. No matter what your level of experience, you'll put the ideas in this book to immediate and productive use.</span>

                    <span>Finally a book that demystifies Agile Requirements Management. In particular demystifying myths about User Stories themselves.<P>The book puts together ideas from other books on the subject : Writing Effective Use Cases and Requirements by Collaboration :<BR>Workshop for defining needs.<P>This book not only explains properly the concepts but gives you practical advice on how you could use user stories on your projects.<P>I particularly liked the chapter : Using Stories with Scrum.<P>Reading this book was truly an enjoyable and learning experience.</span>

                    <span>Having worked with SW development for more than 20 years, I have finally realised, that face to face, collaborative communication between users and developers in an open atmosphere is the first important step on your way to successfull projects.<BR>Many books covers this briefly in a chapter or two, but with this book, you get a complete manual with techniques, that will be usefull to you in your collaboration with the users.</span>

                    <span>Mike Cohn not only has a wealth of experience but also the ability to tell his story in an understandable and compelling way. The result is that the reader walks away saying, "OK! I get it. I don't know why I thought this would be so hard!" These stories are more than the details of the mechanisms of writing user stories. Sure, that's good all by itself. The big, important thing about this book is that the details are cast in an expansive foundation that really shows you how effective teams work with each other and with customers. That's why I give this two thumbs up!</span>
