                <span id="Label1">Jamie Foxx's uncannily accurate performance isn't the only good thing about <I>Ray</I>. Riding high on a wave of Oscar buzz, Foxx proved himself worthy of all the hype by portraying blind R&B legend Ray Charles in a warts-and-all performance that Charles approved shortly before his death in June 2004. Despite a few dramatic embellishments of actual incidents (such as the suggestion that the accidental drowning of Charles's younger brother caused all the inner demons that Charles would battle into adulthood), the film does a remarkable job of summarizing Charles's strengths as a musical innovator and his weaknesses as a philandering heroin addict who recorded some of his best songs while flying high as a kite. Foxx seems to be channeling Charles himself, and as he did with the life of Ritchie Valens in La Bamba, director Taylor Hackford gets most of the period details absolutely right as he chronicles Ray's rise from "chitlin circuit" performer in the early '50s to his much-deserved elevation to legendary status as one of the all-time great musicians. Foxx expertly lip-syncs to Ray Charles' classic recordings, but you could swear he's the real deal in a film that honors Ray Charles without sanitizing his once-messy life. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I> <p>   <span class="h1"><strong>More on Ray Charles</strong></span> <table cellpadding="4" border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="4"><p>    <tr class="tiny" valign="top" align="center">     <td><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0000032B4.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg"><br><i>Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music</i> (CD)</td><p>      <td><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B000002I4U.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg"><br><i>The Genius of Ray Charles</i> (CD)</td><p>      <td><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0000063EW.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg"><br><i>Ray Charles and Betty Carter--Dedicated to You</i> (CD)</td>   </tr><p>    <tr class="tiny" valign="top" align="center">     <td><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00000343O.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg"><br><i>Genius & Soul--The 50th Anniversary Collection</i> (CD)</td><p>      <td><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1557046492.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg"><br><i>Ray: A Tribute to the Movie, the Music, and the Man</i> (book)</td><p>      <td><img border="0" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0002F7I9Y.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg"><br>More Albums by Ray Charles</td>   </tr> </table></span>

                    <span>"Ray" is a better-than-good movie.  Unfortunatly it is merely better than most instead of great.  The acting is incredible as Mr. Foxx IS Ray Charles.  Showing his childhood in a series of flashbacks, as opposed to seeing it all at once at the beginning of the movie, was effective in keeping the viewer wanting more. The only knock against the film in my mind is the lack of theme.  What one thing does his life, in this film, teach us or make us feel? "Work hard no matter your limits"? "Treat your loving wife better than your mistress"?  "Don't do drugs in Canada"? The last few minutes devolve into an ABC Afterschool Special.  Very interesting man.  Less than perfect film. </span>

                    <span>Jamie Foxx does a such a great job, I felt like I was watching Ray Charles himself. Foxx definitely deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor. Foxx talks like Ray Charles and moves like him. This movie does a excellent job in covering the struggles of a blind person to rise from total poverty to become one of the greatest musicians of the U.S. Yes, some of the faults of Ray are shown in this movie, but he makes it up for the creativity and openmindedness to music. Charles even talks about the reasons why he performed some country music. I liked how the movie gave a background of some of the songs that were created and performed by Ray Charles. I just bought a Ray Charles album before this movie, and this movie made me appreciate his music more. All music has a story to tell, and this movie gave a story to the music of a musician who we will honor in his contribution to American arts. </span>

                    <span>"Ray" is an outstanding bio-pic about R&B superstar and innovator Ray Charles, who is played by Jamie Foxx.  Ok, he 'played' Charles is an understatement; Foxx disappeared in the role.  The only time I ever saw an actor get that deep in a role was George C. Scott as Patton.  It is uncanny how Fox has all of Charles's ticks and movements down.  Jamie Foxx richly deserved his Oscar.  I here by formaly appologize for calling Foxx a terrible actor (I had just seen "Booty Call" and didn't have high hopes; this and "Collateral" changed my mind).  And then there is the story itself, which is beyond inspirational.  Ray fought against unbelievable odds (being blind and black was only two of them), both perfessional and fought some very personal demons.  It also delves deeply into the less pleasent aspects of his nature.  Ray had affairs on the road, he was also a chronic drug user; Ray wasn't always a good man.  Taylor Hackford directs this film as a labor of love, he was involved in writing and producing as well.  If you were a fan of the late musician, or you just enjoy good, solid drama, this is the movie for you.  It is a testement to the film that it is a two and a half hours long movie, but it only felt like it was twenty minutes long!  It is truelly a great film.</span>

                    <span>"Don't you let no body, nothin', or yourselself make you a cripple!" It brings tears into my eyes everytime I remember his mom saying that! She should have been a heart-broken woman who lost one of her bundle of joys to drowning and saw the other one go blind from glaucoma! Nothing could have been harder for a mother. But she was a strong, couragious woman who helped her son and watched over him even long after she was gone! I loved his mother! Sharon Warren, who played Aretha Robinson(Ray's mother) touched my heart, I guess she should have got an oscar too!
<br />Ofcourse, Jamie Foxx did a superb job with this movie.</span>

                    <span>So often the biography films lack a certain something -- usually a message or central theme (other than the person).  This movie reminds me of Pollack in being about a very talented person with some personal issues that cause problems for the people in his life.  Ray Charles, as portrayed brilliantly in this movie by Jaime Foxx, was incredibly talented, but he was kind of a jerk in some ways, particularly his womanizing.  What the film doesn't mention is that he actually had 12 children, 1 from his first wife and 3 by his second wife, both marriages ending in divorce. 
<br />
<br />In my opinion, a more interesting story line involves Ray's mother, who died when Ray was a teenager (after a difficult life, as portrayed in this film).  You get her story "between the lines" as the film flashes back on Ray's difficult childhood -- a childhood so poor that it is miraculous that he survived and was able to accomplish so much, thanks to his strong as iron mother.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend this film -- I could easily imagine watching it again and again.
