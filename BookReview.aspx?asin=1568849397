                <span id="Label1">Dan Gookin's C for Dummies is a two-volume tutorial for beginner C programmers that looks at the basics of programming from the ground up. It moves at a slow, but very logical, pace. If you've ever found traditional C programming books too hard, these two books might be worth a look. The author takes great care in presenting the basics of programming from the ground up and avoids complicated math and syntax wherever possible. The first volume covers the fundamentals of the language, such as basic language constructs, variable types, functions, program logic, looping, and simple console I/O. The second half presents more ANSI C functions, arrays, and strings. Only then does the author take on the difficulties of C pointers. The tutorial closes with some file I/O and the basics of using multi-file projects. Throughout these two books, the author succeeds in making programming fun with a lot of humor (including comics) and as little jargon as possible. The technical information is in there too, between the lines, in separate sections. Each chapter ends with a quiz to make sure you are getting all the basics of programming in C (answers are included at the end of volume two). Plenty of source code is provided for all examples. All in all, this set provides a really successful introduction to C programming, which can succeed where other tutorials fail. If you've been stumped by other introduction to C texts, check out these two books.  </span>

                    <span>I found Dan Gookin's C For Dummies book the best book on C I had ever picked up. Taking the reader from knowing absolutely nothing about programming, Dan writes his book step-by-step, going through all the exercises and examples line by line. After I had read this book, C was so easy I wondered why I was 'scared' to learn it! Everywhere it is sprinkled with spontaneous humour to keep the reader concentrating and to warn him/her not to take things to seriously. Topics covered are, Program elements and design, variables, functions, constants, strings, characters, numbers, math (which is made very easy), values, header files, loops, operators - almost anything. The rest is covered in Volume II which I have not as yet read but am planning to do very shortly. Overall, well-written, funny, understandable and clear. I recommend C For Dummies to anyone who is new to programming and finds other books difficult. Absolutely 100%</span>

                    <span>I've read books before that try to teach you something 
difficult, like..oh..really understanding Windows 95. But
this book doesn't throw you into the Sea of C without a life
 jacket. The author, starts out with a laugh and ends with
 a laugh. If the author wasn't such a good programmer, I'd 
 suggest that he get a job as a comedian. But even though
 he does make a lot of jokes, he accomplishes teaching you a
 somewhat difficult thing, the C programming language. Wow,
 a self teaching book that actually accomplishes what it sets
 out to do. Oh my God, I would have just bought the book to 
 see that. The author walks you through C with alot of
 examples, and ALOT of patience. The only reason I didn't give
 the book a perfect 10 is because it doesn't go through the 
 majority of the language. There's a second volume which I am 
 still waiting for. But since it is going to be written by
 the same author, I will of course be first in line to buy it.</span>

                    <span>This book was a complete waste of time for me. It barely teaches you anything after reading the first volume. What took 1000 pages in this book I can learn in in 100 pages of another book. The author uses so much humor in this book that it gets extremely frustrating. For example, in the quizes after each section he gives a question with multiple choice answers. There are amazingly stupid answers to choose from leaving you with only one logical answer. He might as well just give you the answer rather than writing down bs. He repeats each example over and over again which makes it frustrating. I found myself repeating the same things withouth learning anything new. The only time I would recommend this book if you were some moron who has an iq of 90 and can barely read or if you're a 10 year old and doesn't know what you're doing. It's ridiculous how simple it is he teaches you. It takes the author 20 pages to teach you something you can easily learn in anotehr book in 1 page. I recommend C Primer Plus by Stephen Prata rather than this piece of garbage.</span>

                    <span>I'm a 2nd year computer science major and we use K&R (The C Programming Language 2nd Edition ANSI version) in class. I find it incredibly dry and boring, although I suppose it's terse and to the point. C for Dummies can be repetitious at times but I find that I need and appreciate that. And yeah, the quizzes are dumb but who's taking them anyway? I get enough in class. :) The sections on pointers or structures alone are well worth the price of admission. The index is especially well done. It's easy to jump around, scan and use the book as a reference guide. I also like the "cheat sheet" containing hints and tips that you can rip out and keep by your computer.<BR>SIDE NOTES: Even as a neophyte programmer, I was able to jump pretty much straight into Vol. 2, having only a year of Java experience previously. Also, we use unix gcc at the university and Gookin uses Borland C++ and Microsoft Visual C++ to compile. An earlier reviewer seemed to think that excluding gcc was wrong but I don't think it makes much of a difference -- the fundamental concepts and implementations are the same. The header files Gookin uses are the same as the ones we use in class with unix, too. All in all, Gookin's Vol. 2 is a great book. I haven't looked at Vol. 1 at all but I have no regrets buying the 2-volume set.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the finest book for learning the terse programming language C.Author Dan Gookin takes a very humourous approach to make the whole learning process very easy.Anyone without any clue to programming can start programming in C just going through a few early chapters. If you want to learn C and do not have any idea what it's all about this the book for you.This book might not be for serious programmers but for the beginner it is a wonderful book. The easiest & the best. Thanks Dan.</span>
