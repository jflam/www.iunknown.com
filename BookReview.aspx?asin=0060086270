                    <span>I know many people who really love Debbie Ford's work, so I decided to check her work out myself. I have had great experience listening to people I know and admire - that is how I found Julia Cameron, for example - who has gone on to be instrumental in my own personal growth.
<br />
<br />In this case, I found my thoughts and experiences do not gel with as much of what Debbie Ford says - and I found the presentation of the content to be a bit jarring.
<br />
<br />I discovered I didn't have problems with most of the message of this book, it was more its presentation and organization that I found to be outside the helpful, positive range.
<br />
<br />The book opens with very familiar content, with material from a Tony Robbins quiote, "Quality questions create a quality life."  I agree - wholeheartedly.  It felt rather "status quo, here I am reading another main-stream motivational book" and then Ford takes the leap into Spirituality, with a lot of talk about one's star, life force and flame. Again, I appreciate Spirituality... so aside from the sort of un-gentle glide, I was ok with this content.
<br />
<br />She wrote about Amma, a spiritual leader I have heard others experience, and I thought that was pretty cool so I kept reading and as I did I became less and less comfortable - and more and more curious about what makes so many people so appreciative of this book?
<br />
<br />If you like things like "Choices that DIM YOUR LIFE versus CHOICES THAT MAKE YOUR FIRE ROAR" you will appreciate this book.
<br />
<br />If you believe in by-passing emotion - you will appreciate this book.
<br />
<br />And that is where I shut this book - because as an active creator/performer/writer, I simply can not bypass emotion.  I can bypass opinion, but I can not bypass the truth within my emotion and the message within my emotion.
<br />
<br />For me, that is what was the clincher or the "final straw" so to speak which would keep me from making a recommendation of this particular title. I have tried to write this review to help you to know what might connect with you in this title - and to let you know what was completely disconnecting for me.
<br />

                    <span>I must admit that I have become a Debbie Ford fan!  When I read "The Dark Side of the Light Chasers", I went out and bought several copies for friends and family.  Ms. Ford was able to clearly explain the shadow and how to utilize it for positive transformation.  
<br />
<br />Now, with "The Right Questions," she continues to expose the core of the beliefs and choices we choose that limit who we are.  I have taped two of the questions from her book on my computer screen, so that I have a visual reminder each day.
<br />"Will this choice add to my life force, or will it rob me of my energy?"
<br />
<br />How many people are wondering how to manage and balance their busy lives, yet don't usually take the time to ask themselves whether the choices they are making are hurting or helping them live the life they want?  And yet, how simple it is to make a choice to ask yourself this question when daily requests by others or your own internal demands put you in a position of taking on too much and ending up resentful or exhausted.
<br />
<br />I have found that the best advice is deceptively simple, and I hope Debbie Ford continues to bless the world with her wisdom.

                    <span>The Right Questions will definitely help you become more aware of the choices you are making, whether you have long been on a path to bring out your greatest self, or are just embarking on the life you truly want and deserve. This gem of a book will bring to light the essential questions you can ask yourself, BEFORE you run on automatic pilot, and unintentionally sabotage the direction you truly want to go in. 
<br />This book reads beautifully. It's easy to understand, extremely well written, and is an absolute gift for anyone that wants to really soar in life. HIGHLY recommended for the positive and important impact it will have on your life. 
<br />10 Stars!

                    <span>The power of these questions is immeasuarable. It will change your life IF you USE it everytime you make a important choice.<br>The brain is asking questions on a subconscious level all the time - eg. what should i do now?, is this the right action?, where do i go from here? etc.<br><p>If you study people who are depressed and feel stuck in life, you will invariably find that they use the wrong questions. Questions that make them feel stuck and helpless such as "Why do I always fail?", "Oh, who do i think i am?", "why can't i get it right?", "why does it ALWAYS have to be me?". The human mind cannot help but give answers to these questions, thereby creating a loop of negativity. <p>BUT if you ask the right questions, it will lead to the right answers which makes you stay on your life purpose. The questions in this book are addressing choices you make. There are also other types of powerful questions not included in this book, questions which opens up new ways of thinking and doing things. I would recommend people who would like to explore the power of questions such books as "Frogs Into Princes" and "Structure of Magic" by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. These books address the importance of asking the right questions that they call the "Meta Model" used in NLP. One of the most powerful questions Bandler and Grinder came up with was "What if I could?" everytime you think something is 'impossible'. This question immediately breaks the limitation and opens up new resources and pathways to achieving. Anthony Robbins reckons that this was the one big question that turned him from a failure to success when he was starting out. <p>And instead of saying "I'm depressed", ask instead "HOW exactly am i making myself feel depressed?" thereby breaking the illusion that depression is a 'thing' that one has, instead of the result of some processes in our mind, or posture. Read these books to master these powerful questions which will change your life.</span>

                    <span>Although this book (as other reviewers have pointed out) doesn't have anything radically new to say, I think it's very useful for two reasons.  (1) The author's emphasis on the here-and-now is refreshing:  there are whole shelves of self-help books that focus on goal-setting, which is essential too;  but you actually achieve your goals (or not) through the small day-to-day choices you make, and few authors provide specific help with that part of the process.  (2) If you set goals but consistently fail to get any closer to them, she advises you to examine your daily choices to determine the REAL goals they serve.  This can be very enlightening (and sometimes disquieting), but until you've identified how you may be sabotaging yourself, you'll continue to be frustrated.<p>That said, I found some of the author's advice questionable. (1) She doesn't deal with situations where the "right" choices may conflict.  (E.g., should I get up early to go to yoga class, or get a few more hours of sleep?  If my goal is to be fitter, of course I should go to class;  but if I'm not getting enough sleep, I'm not taking care of myself.  The long-term question may be "Why am I overcommitted?", but the immediate problem is sleep deprivation, and doing the "right" thing may compound the problem and/or distract you from addressing the real question.) (2) This may be petty, but I find it annoying when someone who (from her photograph) appears thin, to the point of being almost anorexic, makes self-righteous pronouncements about sticking to diets!  (3) The model of behavior she appears to be promoting is total control at all times:  you shouldn't make ANY decision, no matter how small, without asking whether your choice serves some lofty purpose.  While I agree that it's helpful to observe the patterns in the choices you make, and to change a pattern if it gets in the way of your life goals, some trivial decisions really ARE trivial (chocolate or vanilla?), and it's OK to lighten up every now and then!</span>
