                <span id="Label1">Java programmers know how finicky Java can be to work with. An omitted semi-colon or the slightest typo will cause the Java command-line compiler to spew pages of annoying error messages across your screen. And it doesn't fix them--that's up to you: fix them, compile again, and hope that nothing goes wrong this time.   <P>Eclipse, the popular Java integrated development environment (IDE) provides an elegant and powerful remedy for this common, frustrating scenario. It doesn't just catch your errors before you compile, it also suggests solutions. All you need to do is point and click. And it's free--what could be better? Still, if you're like most programmers, mastering a new technology--no matter how productive it will make you in the long run--is going to take a chunk out of your productivity now. You want to get up to speed quickly without sacrificing efficiency.   <P>O'Reilly's new guide to the technology, Eclipse, provides exactly what you're looking for: a fast-track approach to mastery of Eclipse. This insightful, hands-on book delivers clear and concise coverage, with no fluff, that gets down to business immediately. The book is tightly focused, covering all aspects of Eclipse: the menus, preferences, views, perspectives, editors, team and debugging techniques, and how they're used every day by thousands of developers. Development of practical skills is emphasized with dozens of examples presented throughout the book.   <P>From cover-to-cover, the book is pure Eclipse, covering hundreds of techniques beginning with the most basic Java development through creating your own plug-in editors for the Eclipse environment. Some of the topics you'll learn about include:   <P>Using Eclipse to develop Java code   <P>Testing and debugging   <P>Working in teams using CVS   <P>Building Eclipse projects using Ant   <P>The Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)   <P>Web development   <P>Developing Struts applications with Eclipse  <P>From basics to advanced topics, Eclipse takes you through the fundamentals of Eclipse and more. You may be an Eclipse novice when you pick up the book, but you'll be a pro by the time you've finished.</span>

                    <span>I have been working with Eclipse and its derivatives (e.g., IBM/Rational's XDE for Java) for over a year now. The most significant reality about Eclipse for a user is its long learning curve. There is so much in Eclipse, and just knowing what you can configure is a challenge. When I read Holzner's book last month, from the first chapter I kept bemoaning, "Why didn't I have this book a year ago?" I can recommend this book without reservation for anyone moving to Eclipse as a Java development environment. Many recent books focus specifically on writing plug-ins for Eclipse. Holzner covers writing a simple plug-in, but what he has written is a book for developers who want to use Eclipse to write and test real Java applications.<P>Holzner's style is to cover a lot of ground without getting tediously deep into any single subject area. This is one reason his writing is so readable. In this book he has a very nice introduction to using the JUnit perspective for automated unit testing, a concise introduction to the debug perspective, a chapter on Ant for building projects, and integrating Eclipse with the CVS software repository.<P>Holzner spends several chapters on GUI and web development, but don't look for detailed information on how to do Swing, or JSPs. Holzner's focus is on how Eclipse supports development in these areas. He has a chapter on Swing GUI application development, two chapters on SWT (IBM's Standard Widget Toolkit) development, and a very accessible chapter on using Eclipse for web development with JSPs, servlets, javabeans, and how to use the Sysdeo Tomcat plug-in to simplify your life. I was not aware of this plug-in until I read this book, and knowing about it was almost worth the price of the book. The chapter on Struts development was the least clear to me, only because I have not worked with Struts, but if you understand the Model-View-Controller architecture you will be able to get a good understanding in this chapter of what Struts is trying to provide, and how Eclipse will support you.<P>Holzner offers two chapters on developing plug-ins, and I am impressed that he could convey so much in just two chapters. Plug-in development can be very complex, but Holzner presents the basic requirements very cogently. He closes out the book with a pro-spective on Eclipse 3.0, now finally available at eclipse.org. <P>It was a fun, quick read, and even after more than a year of using Eclipse I learned some really nice things from this book.</span>

                    <span>The book does have lots of graphics as referred to by other reviewers but they are appropriate and explain the text. "One picture is worth a 1000 words". <P>Common development tasks are covered in enough detail to help beginners and those new to an IDE. <P>Not everyone likes to read the online help to learn how to use software while most of us will search for a specific topic. This book satisfies the need for a clear understandable how to manual of the basic functionality. Just think of it as the printed user manual for those who like to have a paper reference. <P>The only criticism is that the cover reference to coverage of 3.0 is misleading because it is discussed in only 18 pages out of 295.</span>

                    <span>If you use Eclipse or any of the expanding list of products based on Eclipse, this book should be on your short list. It is easy to read and follow as the author explains in detail each of the core features which are common across all derivations of Eclipse. The book is geared toward Java developers and will be of limited use to developers who wish to use Eclipse for other languages (which the author essentially admits on page one). It lives up to the claim found in the preface: "It's a programmer-to-programmer book, written to bring you up to speed in Eclipse without wasting time."<P>If you are new to Eclipse, I would definitely recommend this book. It's a great "bring you up to speed" book. There are a lot of screenshots and code examples to move you through each of the basic features: how to create, debug, test (with JUnit), use source control (with CVS) and build (with Ant). <P>Depending on how familiar you are with Eclipse (I have been using Eclipse for a couple years), this may not be the book for you. The first hundred pages or so will likely not be anything new - although, I did have an "Oh, yeah - Scrapbook Pages!" moment. If you are interested in using SWT, Tomcat, Struts or Eclipse plug-in development, keep in mind this is more of a "bring you up to speed" than a detailed "how to" description of these topics.</span>

                    <span>first of all the book i got (yes i checked the isbn)<BR>was only 317 pages and was not subtitled,<BR> "A Java Developer's Guide" but instead "Programming Java Applications".<BR> There was less than 20 pages coverage of 3.0. very lightwieght.<BR> I wouldn't say this was a book for programmers, but the equivalent of a user's manual for eclipse(eclipse made EZ, or eclipse for VB programmers).<BR> The first two chapters(60 pages) is just telling you what the menu items do. Almost all the material in this book was covered in the Manning Eclipse in Action book. The exception being this book had 3 chapters(60 pages on gui and swt), and a chapter on struts. I only kept the book for that stuff. <P> I get the impression this is just a knock-off that book so that O'Reilly gets some of the beginner market...<BR> Probably not worth your time if you have used eclipse for more than 10 days...</span>
