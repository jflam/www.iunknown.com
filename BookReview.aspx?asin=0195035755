                <span id="Label1">Many histories of the American Revolution are written as if on stained glass, with George Washington's forces of good battling King George III's redcoat devils. The actual events were, of course, far more complex than that, and Robert Middlekauff undertakes the difficult task of separating the real from the mythic with great success. From him we learn that England taxed the colonials so heavily in an attempt to retire the massive debt incurred in defending those very colonials against other powers, notably France; that the writing of the Constitution was delayed for two years while states argued among themselves in the face of massive military losses; and that demographic shifts during the Revolution did much to increase America's ethic diversity at an early and decisive time. Vividly told, this is a superb account of the nation's founding.</span>

                    <span>Middlekauf does a masterful job of laying out the grand events and issues of the American Revolution.  His book reads as though it were written in a time when historians were interested in writing about real decision makers and significant figures that actually shaped events, rather than about "women's" and other dubious "studies" of subjects that hardly impacted the course of events and explain nothing about the American Revolution.  This book is therefore a wonderfully refreshing break from banal political correctness that won't waste one's time talking about side issues that have more to do with modern-day fashionable hang-ups than the actual events that dictated the course of the American Revolution.  The fact that Middlekauf doesn't snear at "dead white men," but rather actually acknowledges the debt all of us owe to the genius of the Founding Fathers, is just added icing on the cake.</span>

                    <span>Middlekauff's book aims to be an in-depth overview of the Revolutionary War period but falls short in many areas.  The Oxford series seem to be written for the average reader who wants to get an introduction into the time period and events.  Middlekauff's book, although not difficult to understand, will probably only be best understood by those who have studied the American Revolution before (besides in your eigth-grade history class).  Some key figures are given fairly good descriptions, but others simply appear without any sort of introduction.  The events are not presented in the chronological narrative structure that newcomers to the subject will be able to follow easily.  In an attempt to surround events to understand them fully, Middlekauff jumps around a lot.  This leads to not only gaps of information that other reviewers have detailed, but repetition of information.  The book is uneven in its studies - some events are detailed with extreme clarity and others are muddled through or skipped over.  The most well-written parts of the book involve the Stamp Act crisis and the details of the major conflicts.  Middlekauff's attempts to explain what was happening in Britain during the time period are mixtures of insightful analysis and huge gaps.  Because he does not consistently follow events in Britain, the passages concerning them usually begin with a short, confusing explanation that the political scene changed a lot since the last time it was discussed.<p>The thesis revolves around the spread, fight over, and the eventual embodiment of the revolutionary ideals in American government.  Overall, Middlekauff succeeds in his descriptions of how a varied political landscape of separate colonies evolved into a confederation and then nation, without making the process seem the obvious and only path available.  It was a difficult and uncertain adventure, which Middlekauff excels at capturing.  The biggest problem with the book is that it is reminiscent of a time when history was the study of white men and their wars.  Almost no time is spent discussing the role of women, blacks, or Native Americans in the Revolution.  The homefront is generally only discussed in terms of how they supplied (or failed to) the American soldiers, and this is mostly about the men.  Slaves are given only a few paragraphs and Native Americans are reduced to the shadowy evil-threat to civilization that was far too common in old history.  Almost nothing is mentioned of Native American allies, but much is said about the threat they presented to Geogian settlers.  This treatment is almost unheard of in modern historiography, and was out of date when Middlekauff published the book.  You cannot get a complete overview of the time without addressing these people and the issues that effect them.  How they are involved in the Revolution's ideals is never discussed, despite the fact that this is the thesis.  This failure makes the astounding amount of research that went into the book look incomplete and should be taken into account by anyone interested in reading about the period.</span>

                    <span>After reading the other three works from the Oxford Series, I was expecting something similar (well-wriiten and readable history). Unfortunately, this book falls short for the following reasons:<br>1) Boring (and I really like reading history, this says something)<br>2) The writing style makes it difficult to follow events (one becomes even more confused about the Revolution from reading this book)<br>3) overanalysis on events (4 chapters just on the Stamp Act is a bit much)<br>The American Revolution is a great story, filled with interesting events and characters. Why doesn't Middlekauff include more of these? His book is more focused on trivial details and overanalysis which lessen the "big picture". Anyone looking for a good and readable book on the revolution should aviod this one!</span>

It tells in practical terms how the war started and how it was one and won.  It is the book that most people need.</span>

                    <span>Middlekauff has read deeply in the history of the American revolution and the early republic.  Moreover, he is interested in more than just a simple narrative; he is interested in causes and motives, as he shows in chaps. 20 and 21 of this book, which discusses why soldiers fought instead of ran.<p>Unfortunately, the narrative in this book has holes, and Middlekauff often fails to put people and personalities into context, making the reading less interesting than it should be.  He also makes high demands on readers' attention; this, plus the holes, made the book heavy going at times.<p>Here are some examples of holes: 1) In his discussion of the Intolerable Acts, Middlekauff fails to say what the Quebec Act was, yet on  pp. 239 and 280 he assumes you know. 2) 471: "They all knew what happened to Buford's men at Waxhaws when they tried to run away."  This is the only time "Buford" and "Waxhaws" are mentioned in the book. 3) 340: "June also brought William Howe back to New York."  I can't find where it says Howe had been in New York before.  4) 462: "Some hint of what was coming was given ...when the victors, shouting 'Tarleton's Quarter,' shot and stabbed the wounded..." There is no explanation of this anywhere in the book. 478: "... Lee's Legion rode in.  Greene once more had his army in one piece." This is the first time that "Lee's Legion" is mentioned.  I had to look in the index to find out that "Lee" was Henry Lee. It never explains how he got a legion. The last time we saw him, on 417, he was foraging in Delaware.<p>No context for people and personalities: Isaac Barre gives a speech supporting the colonies in parliament (74-75), but Middlekauf never tells us who he is or why he speaks so strongly.<br>Directly below, the American who thinks Barre's speech is "noble" is never identified. Apparently it was Jared Ingersoll, who appears in a very different light in other parts of the book.<p>Demands on reader's attention: 406-7 "Amherst told the king..." This is Jeffrey Amherst.  The last time we met him, also identified only as "Amherst", was page 276, where he was fighting Montcalm in Quebec for all of one sentence.  Look up Amherst in the index, see where he appears, and see how easy it is to connect these references.  This is very tough, demanding writing.<p>Middlekauff knows the period, is a very intelligent writer, has interesting views and judgments which he backs up effectively.  However, if you want to understand what is going on, you will have to go to other books in addition to this one, and you will have to pay very close attention to Middlekauff, with pencil in hand and constant reference to the index.<p>As an example of a book which brings people and personalities strongly into context, I recommend Barbara Tuchman's "March of Folly" which has an outstanding chapter on "The British Lose America."  This will tell you who Barre was, why they were drinking toasts to John Wilkes in South Carolina in 1768, and what the Quebec Act was.  It's only a tiny fragment of the history Middlekauff tries to cover, and occasionally falls down as well (Tuchman mangles the text of Barre's speech), but is a great example of fascinating historical writing which historians would do well to study.</span>
