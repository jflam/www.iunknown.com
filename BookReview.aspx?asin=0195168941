                <span id="Label1">In the Cold War era that dominated the second half of the twentieth century, nobody envisaged that the collapse of the Soviet Union would come from within, still less that it would happen meekly, without global conflagration. In this brilliantly compact, original, engaging book, Stephen Kotkin shows that the Soviet collapse resulted not from military competition but, ironically, from the dynamism of Communist ideology, the long-held dream for "socialism with a human face." The neo-liberal reforms in post-Soviet Russia never took place, nor could they have, given the Soviet-era inheritance in the social, political, and economic landscape. Kotkin takes us deep into post-Stalin Soviet society and institutions, into the everyday hopes and secret political intrigues that affected 285 million people, before and after 1991. He conveys the high drama of a superpower falling apart while armed to the teeth with millions of loyal troops and tens of thousands of weapons of mass destruction. Armageddon Averted vividly demonstrates the overriding importance of history, individual ambition, geopolitics, and institutions, and deftly draws out contemporary Russia's contradictory predicament.</span>

                    <span>"...What no one, from national-security experts to ordinary citizens such as my mother, dared to dream was that within ten years of Brezhnev's death, the Soviet Union would collapse and simply cease to exist. How and why did this momentous event occur? Princeton University historian Stephen Kotkin takes up these salient questions in his concise, readable, and informative book Armageddon Averted: The Soviet Collapse, 1970-2000.<P>"Kotkin dismisses the oft-cited explanations that emphasize increased U.S. military spending and the failure of central planning, arguing that as late as 1985 the Soviet Union was 'lethargically stable' (p. 2). Instead, he blames attempts -- first initiated by Khrushchev's de-Stalinization effort and culminating in Gorbachev's policies of perestroika, glasnost, and democratization -- to reform a system that was inherently incapable of reform. To offer only an explanation of the Soviet Union's collapse, no matter how compellingly argued, however, is unsatisfactory because that explanation leaves too many questions unanswered. Why were the reforms undertaken? Why did the Soviet elites not resist them? What effect did the Soviet legacy have on the reforms? By considering these questions, Kotkin provides a deeper understanding of the Soviet Union's astonishing collapse....<P>"The man to undertake the reforms was Mikhail Gorbachev. Perhaps the most revealing comment on Gorbachev is a 1988 statement by Milovan Djilas that Kotkin quotes: 'Gorbachev, unlike Brezhnev, strikes me as a true believer' (p. 31). Perhaps he was a true believer because, as Kotkin points out, he had witnessed many socialist and Soviet triumphs: for example, Sputnik, manned space flight, and communist takeovers in China and Cuba. Whatever the reason, this belief entailed that Gorbachev would not be satisfied with 'lethargic stability.' He would seek reforms, and, unlike Khrushchev, he had the political skills to carry them through. Perhaps surprisingly, he attempted reform for a largely receptive population who maintained a 'strong allegiance to socialism' (p. 44) despite deteriorating economic conditions (for example, it typically took ten years to get an apartment). Neither Gorbachev nor the populace realized that reform ultimately would lead to collapse....<P>"According to Kotkin, what made Gorbachev's reforms so risky, far riskier than Gorbachev ever realized, was that he, unlike Khrushchev, did not have an ideological safety net. Whereas Khrushchev could say that socialism's failure was owing to Stalin and that reforms would restore 'Leninism,' when Gorbachev acknowledged socialism's need for reform, the only possible conclusion was that socialism itself was inherently flawed. In the end, the Soviet Union could not afford the superpower competition. Its economy was underperforming, and its ideology was bankrupt. It withdrew from Afghanistan and gave up eastern Europe. In August 1991, conservatives tried to restore the old order, but their attempt failed with Boris Yeltsin's standing triumphantly and defiantly atop a Soviet tank. With nothing to hold the Soviet Union together, it disintegrated without the bloodshed that many had believed inevitable. Gorbachev acknowledged reality by formally dissolving the union in December 1991.<P>"The USSR may have formally ended its seventy-four-year existence in 1991, but its legacy resulted in a continuing collapse, which Kotkin documents in chapters 5 and 6. In Russia, Yeltsin promised a market economy, although he knew nothing about one. Even a politician with the most thorough understanding of market capitalism would have been unable to withstand the former-Soviet elites who were establishing their own version of 'capitalism.' These elites, many of whom had abandoned any ideological attachment to socialism and the rest of whom were quite willing to do so when faced with the possibility of financial gain, began systematically to appropriate state assets. Kotkin explains the appalling and systemic corruption that contaminated the privatization process, which culminated in perhaps the most egregious episode, the infamous 'loans for shares' deal. Realizing that the 'mass opportunism of self-privatization' was irreversible, vice premier Anatoly Chubais simply chose to 'institutionalize' and 'rationalize' it (p. 130)....<P>"In sum, Kotkin presents a practical, accessible, and informative account of the Soviet Union's collapse. His book stands as a suitable complement to Richard Pipes's Communism: A History (New York: Modern Library, 2001), which explores more of the philosophical reasons for communism's demise. Yet Kotkin's book is more than a historical retelling of the Soviet Union's fall. It provides an explanation of how and why the Soviet Union fell, a story of socialism's inability to compete with the West, its loss of hope, and the willingness of those in power to prostitute any remaining belief in socialist ideals for corrupt material gain. The book also serves as a case study of socialism's inability to reform itself without self-destruction and of the ensuing institutional shortcomings that render market capitalism and political liberalism difficult to obtain. Those who believed that Russia could quickly copy the economic perfor-mance and political liberty of the West failed to understand that the Soviet Union's legacy was antithetical to markets, private property, and the rule of law. Kotkin's book should appeal to any reader who grew up in the shadow of the Cold War and wants to understand more fully not only how and why the Soviet Union fell, but also why its legacy has been so bitter and enduring."<P>------------------------------<BR>Excerpted from a review by Jody Lipford in "The Independent Review," Winter 2004.</span>

                    <span>I had just returned from a trip to Russia when I came across this little book purporting to explain the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union. I've read other works on russian and Soviet history, but have never come across such a clear presentation of the issues to consider. Other reviewers have suggested that there's too much political bias in the account and that it's boring. I did not find this at all (especially the boring part), and I've always had a sympathy for the Left. Indeed, when I was in Russia and witnessed first hand the impressive and awe-inspiring achievements of Soviet and Czarist Russia (as well as some of the more horrific ones) I asked people to explain to me what caused the collapse of the Soviet Union, an idealist experiment that went wrong disappointing so many who hoped for a better system. You cannot help but ask these questions as you see the unbelievable luxury and wealth in Moscow and parts of St. Petersburg with the obvious poverty that co-exists with it. Yet, as the notes of the soviet anthem so poignantly reflect, The Soviet Union was supposed to herald a new era in human relations. Of course, reality has a way of breaking dreams and I believe that Stephen Kotkin has captured the illusion and its collapse, outlining the reasons and the effcts with unprecedented clarity. perhaps, more than this, Kotkin offers a model for analyzing the problems faced by all regimes as they attempt a reform from within and is a very effective text to understand politics in much of the developing world and I found personally usful in studying such regimes as Egypt under Sadat and Mubarak, Qadhafi's in Libya, or Asad of Syria. It's definitely a short book that travels very far.</span>

                    <span>In Armageddon Averted: The Soviet Collapse, historian Stephen Kotkin demonstrates a profound knowledge of the political and economic structures and institutions that have shaped Soviet and post-Soviet history over the past several decades. This excellent little book makes two provocative arguments that contradict the conventional wisdom concerning the demise of the Soviet regime and its aftermath. <P>Kotkin's first argument is that what has passed for "reform" since 1991 has been the ongoing structural and institutional decay of the old system. Obsolete, inefficient factories are no more productive now than they were during Soviet times; government officials, well-connected insiders, and factory managers continue to bilk the country of its treasure; and presidential perquisites rival those of former politiboro members. With no rule of law, no system of credit, a weak legal system, and a national bank that speculates on its own currency and hides funds in offshore accounts, the reforms of the post-Soviet era are a myth. Indeed, in a de facto sense, the old system is still in its death throes. <P>The second part of Kotkin's argument concerns the end of Soviet rule in 1991. Kotkin believes that the Soviet regime could have muddled along for several years after 1991 without imploding. It still had a large and powerful military with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons at its disposal. It wasn't the brilliance of American foreign policy or economic decline that caused the regime to fall when it did. Instead, in a paradoxical sense, it was Gorbachev's belief in the humanistic nature of socialism that did in the system. Socialism was supposed to be fair and just, ensuring a decent quality of life for the Soviet people, a dream that Gorbachev tried to deliver. His ideological convictions led him to try to reform a system that could not be reformed. His policy of "glasnost" or openness made even more apparent to the public the failings of the system. And, because he believed that socialism was based on humanistic principles, he refused to resort to violence on a large scale to hold the Union together. <P>While this is a brilliant little book, some important issues could have been more extensively explored. A greater exploration of the influences underpinning Gorbachev's ideological convictions would have been helpful. What books did he read? Why did he see the good in the system when so many others did not? Other than believing in the inherent goodness of socialism, were there additional factors that fueled Gorbachev's decision to allow the Soviet Union to disintegrate relatively peacefully? For example, some may argue that Gorbachev, keenly aware of his place in history, knew that he would be viewed as a villain had he butchered his own people to save the regime. Indeed, Gorbachev just may have been too decent a human being to preside over a bloodbath, regardless of his ideological convictions. Moreover, from a geopolitical standpoint, it would have been dangerous for Gorbachev to use overwhelming force internally. The United States and the rest of the world were keeping a close watch on him. Gorbachev had no assurances that the West wouldn't support independence movements in the Republics had he moved decisively to suppress them. <BR> <BR>In his concluding remarks, Kotkin indicates that Russia's best bet for the future might be to join the euro. While this might be a great idea in theory, one wonders when Russia will be able to meet the economic criteria required to do so.</span>

                    <span>This book's utility is far less than apparent due to its almost complete focus on internal reasons for the USSR's collapse. Bluntly, Mr. Kotkin doesn't admit that American policy had anything to do with it. It is fair to compare Armageddon Averted to a coroner's report that a subject, with an obvious bullet wound to the heart, died of heart failure while entirely omitting any mention of the wound. Maybe the latter wasn't responsible for the subject's death, but a complete failure to mention the bullet wound renders the report's credibility suspect.<P>Which is too bad here as Mr. Klotkin does an otherwise excellent job of presenting many complicated themes, with supporting evidence, in a readable and even entertaining fashion. I learned much from it. Armageddon Averted will be an excellent source for later works on the subject by more objective writers. Other readers should avoid it unless they are familiar enough with the subject to compensate for Mr. Kotkin's biases.</span>

                    <span>The author provides a rare and insightful look into the unsavoury world of the Soviet political/robber class, but I believe he overstates their impact. <P>An economy as fully mobilized as that of the USSR was far more resilient to skimming than most people realize (what people don't take into account when they hear that some huge sum was stolen, is that that money is subsequently spent, thus returning to the economy. The only net loss is therefore the money they 1)Smuggle out of the country or 2)Don't spend. The autocratic government made the former difficult, and poverty made the second impractical).<P>Very important to the collapse were the rise of the Solidarity movement (and the support it enjoyed abroad), and the expense of maintaining a huge military, intelligence complex and the lofty space program.<P>The failure of the USSR to move against the increasing gall of the upstart democratic movements in the central European satellite states, the lack of decisive political leadership and the increased tolerance of political dissent. This led to a weakening of the republic, but more importantly, the people's fear of the state evaporated. As the grip over the population loosened, harsh reality came to bear and the system collapsed.</span>
