                    <span>What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good.</span>

                    <span>This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts. The book was consistently funny, insightful, and a good primer on several financial issues that dominated the 1980's.  Most of these articles, for those interested in the authors' chronological history, came after he wrote his groundbreaking financial humor book entitled Liars Poker, which is regarded as a "must read" for anyone entering into the investment banking industry, particularly in bond trading where we he worked.<p>Mr. Lewis' writing style is great, which is why I read his book entitled Next, another good read if you are interested.  Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it.<p>The topics are a wide array and include stories about the domestic S&L scandal, some events that occurred in the French Bourse (their word for a stock market), the proliferation of the American Express Card during the 1980s, some offshore banking insights, Louis Rukeyser, Donald Trump, LBO stories and some comments on the Japanese capitalists.  Like I said, he talks about a wide array of topics but remember that the book is a compilation of many articles.  <p>I give it a 4 star rating.  It was highly entertaining but nothing that caused my life to change or caused me to have a "light bulb" go off in my head.</span>

                    <span>This collection of previously published articles is at times very funny, insightful, and a good primer on several financial issues that dominated the 1980's, but it can also be repetitive (many of the articles repeat jokes, anecdotes, and some even seem to be slightly altered version of previous articles)and is quite dated since the articles detail financial events and characters of the mid to late 1980's. I learned a fair amount about the savings and loan scandals, leveraged buy outs, and the Japanese economic miracle and collapse, and also enjoyed some amusing tales of financial excess, but I had to read through a lot of less than interesting pages to find those treasures. I would not recommend someone buy this book, but if you can find it in the library, it is certainly worth flipping through it.</span>

                    <span>This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts.  Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought.  Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel.</span>
