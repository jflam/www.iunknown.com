                    <span>This is a most worthy companion to the visitor's guide to CALIFORNIA'S EASTERN SIERRA, previously reviewed by this writer. Written in the same clear, direct, organized style, and similarly divided into sectional analyses of various attractions and history, this guide also has the same outstanding color photography. <p>It is difficult to sufficiently praise the clear travel directions given to find each discussed attraction. Not only directions, but anticipated road conditions, are set forth at the conclusion of the section addressing each feature.<p>As you will discern, Death Valley should have been made a National Park a long time ago.  It is the hottest, driest, and lowest place in North America.  It has recent volcanoes, enormous sand dunes, totally indigenous wildlife, great mineral deposits, a playa where the stones move about from unknown forces (called the Recetrack), marvelously beautiful rock formations and salt flats, and even a castle.  Each is discussed in riveting detail that beckons the reader to come there.<p>You will also read about the history of Death Valley, including marooned pioneers, borax mining and the twenty-mule-team methods of transporting out the borax, old ghost towns, etc, etc.  Each section is endlessly fascinating.<p>The book also takes the reader to many facinating areas outside Death Valley, including the now-dry Searles Lake, with its eroded towers of tufa resembling a city, the Pamamint Range bordering Death Valley, various canyons, and even a waterfall in the desert.  You will repeatedly enjoy vicariously wandering this enormous, desolate, but incredibly beautiful and peaceful region.<p>There is some small overlapping between this book and EASTERN SIERRA, but the effect is magnify the fascinating nature of the regions, and not too distract or bore the reader.<p>I recommend purchase of both guides before taking any trip to these areas.  Reading the guides first and during the trips will increase your enjoyment and understanding manyfold, and help tremendously in planning the trip.<p>Needless to say, both books are recommended to the hilt.</span>

                    <span>This book is a wealth of amazing information for anyone from a photographer to someone wanting to know more about the history of this amazing area of the United States. The photos are up-to date (no 1970 fuzzy poor quality images) and the read is nicely paced. <p>Quotes from those that founded this land, history about the ages of the stone and rock types found here. Lots of info on the animals, plant life and the story behind many if not all of the ghosts towns that are found here (one used to have around 10,000 people living there but shrunk to 1 in less than 10 years).<p>Of course on top of all this history and images, are descriptions of each area of the Death Valley National Park and what to see in each area (along with driving instructions).<p>I'm going to Death Valley to photograph this amazing land in two weeks, this book is my must-have companion for the trip.</span>
