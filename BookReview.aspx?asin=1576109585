                <span id="Label1">There was a time when making an animated film meant, at the very least, a huge investment in time and equipment. <I>Flash 5 Cartoons and Games</I> demonstrates how things have changed, teaching a new generation of animators that all you really need is an ordinary PC or Mac and Macromedia's Flash authoring program.<p>  Diverse and powerful, Flash can be used to create Web sites and multimedia presentations. Animation is an art in itself, and the book approaches the use of Flash from an animator's and game designer's perspective. Eleven chapters describe a production workflow, from early story development to using Flash to create a storyboard, adding sound, creating elements and movement, and creating backgrounds.<p>  There are a number of outstanding features to this book: for one, it doesn't focus on the technology. There is as much information on using Flash as there is in composing a scene, using color and sound to evoke a mood, and using quick sketches for storyboard timing. Also, there is a strong emphasis on character animation. Chapter 5 is, in fact, called "Character Animation," followed by chapter 6, "Lip Syncing and Facial Expressions." These sections and others throughout the book show how to use Flash features like reusable symbols and libraries to create believable characters.<p>  A little more than half the book focuses on animation. The second half covers game design, programming, and animation, with an emphasis on trivia and adventure games. You'll need to know a bit about Web scripting and how Flash scripting works to get the most out of the material. <p>  The CD-ROM includes a wide variety of examples, including runtime files (*.swf) and the authoring files used to create them. This provides the beginner with an opportunity to see the finished product as well as look behind the curtain to see what makes it tick.<p>  Beyond the golden age of cartoons (1930s to mid-'40s), it's hard to think of a better time in history to be an animator than right now. Not only are the tools to create entire films easily accessible, but reaching a global audience is a breeze, thanks to the Web and technologies like QuickTime and Flash. <I>Flash 5 Cartoons and Games</I> can show you how to harness these tools and take advantage of the new medium. <I>--Mike</I> </span>

                    <span>I am normally a very slow reader. I only read quickly with the rare book that I thoroughly enjoy, and will use to the fullest extent. Flash 5 Cartoons and games provided this criteria, and i finished it in a week. It is simply amazing. It was everything I was looking for to get me started into advanced Flash use, and amazing cartoon animation. The authors even provided a CD-ROM to go along with this superb book that gives detailed examples, including games, .flas to play around with, and .swfs to watch and enjoy...it even included an entire music video featuring a pelican singing about pollution! All made with flash.This book is well worth the price and then some!</span>

                    <span>On the lower right corner, on the back cover of this book, you will find a small yellow panel announcing that this book is for intermediate to advanced Flash users. If you are new to ActionScripting, wait until you are much more familiar with it to purchase this pricey tome. Written in a soothing informal tone, the co-authors walk the reader step-by-step through the very beginning nuances of the game scripting, explaining each in detail. This is nice even for someone with an intimate knowledge of scripting, as a game vehicle may be new territory.<BR>But then suddenly, and without warning, despite words of encouragement and promises of clarity, the reader is left with no direction, and only a CD-ROM and a tangled web of scripting left to pull apart. A more moderate explanation throughout the entire process would have been much more helpful; the beginner/expert switch in the middle of a project is more than a little disheartening.<BR>Despite the odd art and the organizational letdowns, I still found this book inspirational.</span>

                    <span>I think the other reviewers are being too negative. Would I recommend this book if you wanted to make Hollywood quality pictures? No. But if you are interested in a Hobby or even a small consulting practice focusing on Flash Cartoons and Games then this book is a wonderful addition to your library. You need other books on the fundamentals of Flash to fill in the gaps and get your understanding of Flash up to the level necessary to use this book.</span>
