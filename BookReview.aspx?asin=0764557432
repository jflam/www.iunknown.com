                    <span>If you already know how to program and you're looking for a good JavaScript reference, this is the book for you.  However, if you're not already an experienced programmer this book won't be of much help.  JavaScript Concepts & Techniques: Programming Interactive Web Sites does a much better job of teaching people to program in JavaScript. The JavaScript Bible assumes you already understand basic programming concepts and can program efficiently in some other language.
<br />
<br />That said, Danny Goodman's JavaScript Bible does an excellent job of explaining the idiosyncrasies of the JavaScript language to experienced programmers.  The book contains detailed syntax listings and descriptions of Core and Client-Side JavaScript objects, properties, and methods.  Pertinent examples make it easy to put the explanations into context.
<br />
<br />Every JavaScript programmer worth her salt has a copy of the JavaScript Bible on her bookshelf.</span>

                    <span>The value of this massive book lies in its many examples. The JavaScript language is simple enough, but its the definitions of the system objects that create complexity in using it. Goodman spends lots of time going over the particulars, with short readable examples.
<br />
<br />This is great for the serious HTML writer. I'm imagining a reader who's done a good bit of HTML and may have a little experience with more common kinds of programming. That reader has probably looked into the source code for lots of other people's web pages, and has probably seen JavaScript embedded for various cool functions. Such people will appreciate the thoroughness, detail, examples, and friendly style of the book.
<br />
<br />That intended reader is not a battle-hardened veteran of software engineering or advanced student of computer science. People with more programming background may be disappointed by the relatively low density of the text, and by its organization. The author has created a successful organization grouping by task, but that is very different from a formal presentation of the language and standard APIs.
<br />
<br />Decide who you are and what you want. This is a book for a specific purpose and reading population, and seems to serve those very well. If your purpose or backgorund are different, though, the organization may not meet your needs.

                    <span>I bought this book hoping that it would have a complete alphabetical list of Javascript objects, functions, operators and easy to understand examples and explanations of each. I was imagining that because this book is represented as a 5 star rated "Bible" that there might even be a tutorial. Instead, I found this book a dry theoretical 1236 page tome that is long on theory, and impossibly organized. Even if I know the exact name of the Javascript function/command/object, I had to page through multiple sections to locate it. There is no tutorial and in my experience this book is impossible to use without reading the whole thing. The people that rate this clunker a 5 star have a great sense of humor. </span>

                    <span>I picked up this book and another one (that shall remain unnamed) recently when starting to learn javascript.  What I have appreciated the most about this book is that it seems to always discuss the quirky things about javascript that would take me a day or more to figure out what is going wrong and how to fix.  It has saved me a huge amount of time.</span>
