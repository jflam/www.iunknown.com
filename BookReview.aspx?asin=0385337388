                <span id="Label1">Now a classic! The hilarious  novel of the healing arts that reveals everything your  doctor never wanted you to know. Six eager interns  -- they saw themselves as modern saviors-to-be.  They came from the top of their medical school class  to the bottom of the hospital staff to serve a  year in the time-honored tradition, racing to answer  the flash of on-duty call lights and nubile  nurses. But only the Fat Man --the Clam, all-knowing  resident -- could sustain them in their struggle to  survive, to stay sane, to love-and even to be  doctors when their harrowing year was done.<br><br><br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></span>

                    <span>This book came out in the wake of similar titles like MASH and Catch-22, and describes life as an intern at a hospital in the 1970s. I read it in 1997, and it made me very sad about the state of medicine in this country.
<br />
<br />Fortunately, reading some of the some of the location descriptions in the book, it dawned on me that the hospital in the book is Beth Israel in Boston, where I grew up.
<br />
<br />I mentioned the book and my realization to my mother, who said that back in the 1960s and 70s, Beth Israel had the reputation of being more or less a butcher shop, a good place to go if you wanted to wind up dead nice and fast, vastly different from their current positive reputation.</span>

                    <span>The House of God does a good job of highlighting the issues of iatrogenic morbidity and mortality in a fictional setting.  
<br />
<br />I thought this was a great read and was anxious to talk about it with colleagues.  However, it seems many people, especially within the medical community, do not like to discuss the fact that medicine can and does harm people.  Discussing this novel with a classmate in a joking manner even got me sent to Dean's office during medical school.  In spite of all that, I will continue to recommend this novel to anyone interested in pursuing medicine as a career.
<br />
<br />Dr. Bergman has created a classic book of satire that makes the point that although medical education is getting better, patient care is getting worse.  I look forward to reading Mount Misery, which I understand is losely based on his training at McLean Hospital.

                    <span>I love reading and there have only been three novels in my life which I forced myself to read (the first was part of a book club so I had to read the book in its entirety to discuss with the group, the second one was loaned by a good friend who loved it so I gave it the benefit of the doubt but I did not complete it, and this one).
<br />
<br />There seems to be a consensus in the book reviews for this book that if you're a resident and read this book, it is a sarcastic but realistic portrayal of life as an intern and if you're an outsider, it's disturbing.  I am an outsider and yes I did find it disturbing.  I don't doubt that it might reflect reality.  But the writing is poor, the character development non-existent and the plot nowhere to be seen.  In one book review, it stated the characters are great and really portray hospital life accurately.  In my opinion, this could not be further from the truth.  I kept waiting for the protagonist to share some of his inner thoughts - or just thoughts period, with the reader.  One sentence here and one there alluding that he may want to kill himself just doesn't cut it (no pun intended).  I patiently (again, no pun intended) but persistently plodded through the book waiting, expecting... giving it the benefit of the doubt, since the book was hailed as a classic and because I am interested (as much as an outsider can be) in the field of medicine/health.  But character development never came.  And this applies to all the characters.  Sure, it was interesting to learn about the BUFF and TURF and Gomers Don't Die which we read about in the beginning of the book, but to still talk about it one-third through the book, and then half way through the book, and then two-thirds through the book...  Just the same thing over and over again.  BUFF and TURF, BUFF and TURF, BUFF and TURF.  On and on and on... You call that insight!  Enough already!  I suggest the author keep his day job (MD).

                    <span>I read this book when I was a medical resident at a Southern BMS (Best Medical School), and I was convinced that the author ("Dr. X" at the time) was a colleague! His language, descriptions of patients, anecdotes, and staff portrayals were too similar not to have come directly from the wards and clinics where I worked. And, I was horrified to see, from another vantage point, what I and my fellow residents were becoming. When I re-read the book decades later, I was grateful that a great many things have changed in our approaches to training new physicians. <br>There are two primary aspects of interest in this book: first, it is an uproariously funny book to anyone who trained in an urban medical center in the 1960-1970 era (others will miss 90% of the "in-group" humor), and, second, it is a devastating indictment of the way that physicians were trained at medical centers in the middle of the 20th century. <br>It is a good read, but now of most interest to 50+ year-old physicians and nurses.</span>
