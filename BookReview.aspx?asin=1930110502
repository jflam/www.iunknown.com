                    <span>Review<BR>If you are working in the IBM Websphere area for web application development, you will often encounter references to the Struts architecture framework. IBM highly recommends this standard for Java application development for Websphere. And if you want to acquaint yourself with that framework, this is a good book to get you there.<BR> <BR>The book starts out with a quick sample application that you can download so that you can see a representative Struts-style application. Most of the details are glossed over, but it's only temporary. It's followed by a chapter that goes into the architecture, explaining how it works and why the pieces fit together. From there, another simple application is developed, this time with more explanation as to what is going on. The rest of the book then goes into each part of the Struts framework, with copious code examples and illustrations.<P>The authors assume a fair amount of previous experience on the part of the reader. The assumption is that there is a familiarity with HTML, JSP syntax, JavaBean conventions, and similar technologies. The reader should also be familiar with URLs, web application archives (WAR files), and other concepts surrounding web application development. By assuming these pre-existing skills, the authors can spend more time and space on Struts information. So if you are just starting out in web application development in Java, you may struggle a bit with this information.<P>The authors also assume the use of Tomcat for the web application server. Since I'm working with IBM's Websphere Studio Application Developer (WSAD), I've had to make some mental adjustments on how to get things to work in that environment without the author's direct instruction. Because of this, I'd recommend that you be familiar with WSAD before using this book.<P>The style of the book is very readable, and the concepts are easy to grasp. You may have to read over the material a couple of times to get it, but that's not a fault of the writing. New technology and concepts can be difficult to grasp. Struts is no exception. I can say that I'm understanding the material more quickly than I expected, and that's always a good thing.<P>Conclusion<BR>If you're looking to learn Struts, you would be well-served to get this book and dig in.</span>

                    <span>As other reviewers have said this book starts out great with a couple examples that lay out the main features and advantages of a framework like struts. I personally like to learn by example (is there another way?) and did like these examples even though I am no big fan of frameworks ( I prefer to start from square one so that I am sure I understand 100% of what I do and also feel that everything I do is exactly like I want it).<BR>Unfortunately the book soon changes in an encyclopedic-style<BR>review where examples are scarce to non-existent, explanations<BR>very confuse ( I could check this lack of clarity and method looking at the presentation of concept that are absolutely familiar and clear to me like MVC or Tag Extensions or JSTL .. <BR>well the book explanations were horribly dull and confusing )<BR>and often to understand the subject presented you should have<BR>knowledge of matters presented later in the book.<BR>In conclusion I think this bok might be marginally useful to someoone starting out with Struts .. so if you find it on your colleague's desk open it.. but as for shelling out the $$$ to buy it.. you would be better off investing in ice-creams...</span>

                    <span>A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong? This book shows you can. The book does not have a flow to it, to me it seems just scattered topics piled on eachother. And then, the grand finale, where all you have "learned" is applied in a real world type of thing... By the time it got there, I got so annoyed I did not care anymore. The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even.</span>

                    <span>This book is definitely not worth my time. When I picked up this book, I didn't know anything about Struts. I thought 'Struts in Action' was going to get me up to speed very fast. In the first chapter, after the Struts framework has been set up, we download a starter application only to find that it does not work. In the second chapter, the book just rambles on about Struts architecture. The third chapter gives an example which i found useful..but then the code is all in snippets and not in one place. <P>The three chapters that I read were dull and boring and I had to push myself to get that far. I didn't think it was necessary to read the fourth chapter. I am all set to go and return this book and get my money back.</span>

                    <span>I knew nothing about struts before picking up this book. I know just a little more after having read all that I can stand of it. The book provides very little example code and what it does provide is just in little snippets that don't really help. I'm halfway through the book and I can't take any more theory without being able to get some basic examples running. I consider this book more of a reference than a learning tool. I am abandoning it in favor of a different book. If you're new to struts, look elsewhere for a good introduction.</span>
