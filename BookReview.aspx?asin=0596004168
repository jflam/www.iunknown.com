                <span id="Label1">Microsoft Windows XP may be the latest in a popular family of operating systems, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. However, the designers of Windows XP have built enough flexibility into their product and provided users with a sufficiently large toolkit to overcome most shortcomings. In <I>Windows XP Annoyances</I> David Karp reveals his ideas about how to use Windows XP most effectively, for maximum fun and productivity and as little aggravation as possible. If you're comfortable working with Windows XP (or any of its recent predecessors) but find certain aspects of it, well, <I>annoying</I>, you'll find this book to your liking. Karp guides his readers through potentially risky procedures, such as editing the Registry and adjusting hardware device drivers, with skill and precision.<p>The author's tone is to the point and professional without being dry, without any of the phony, forced humor that appears in a lot of operating-system books. Though he inexplicably ignores the Windows XP Power Toys--some very handy utilities you can get from Microsoft's Web site--he does a great job of handling important questions. Case in point, the important issue of which files can be deleted to free up disk space, and which you shouldn't touch even though they look like pointless garbage. Similarly useful attention goes to the question of which background processes can be safely halted, and which are important. There's fine coverage of scripting with the Windows Script Host (WSH), as well. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to get the most out of Windows XP, even when it appears that the operating system is working against you. Troubleshooting techniques, hardware advice, Registry hacking, interface customization, and advanced networking subjects all find a place in this book.</span>

                    <span>This wonderful book is a Plethora of XP information and Registry Hacks, that will help the average user or IT professional.  I loved the Annoyances website so much, that I invested in this hard-copy book, which has proven to be more than worth the money.<p>I was skeptical of messing with the registry, other than basic Hacks to access certain features of Internet Explorer, at work, until I read "Windows XP Annoyances," by David A. Karp.<p>This book is not-only a great time saver, containing tons of information that will speed-up and improve your O.S., by getting-rid of "Annoyances" and tweaking various aspects of the system, but it will also teach you how to hack the registry. The author gives very detailed scenarios--step-by-step, explaining how to do basic registry hacks, then how to put all those hacks together into a script.  From there, you can use your imagination.<p>This book will make you feel more confident that you will not blow-up your O.S. with some tweaking and it provides information about various applications that do most of the tweaking for you, if goofing with the registry scares you.<p>I have recommended this book to numerous friends in the IT industry.  The site is very helpful, as-well --especially, in a pinch, or on days when there is too much blood in your Caffeine system.</span>

                    <span>If you are an experienced Windows user and are about to move to, or have just moved to XP, this is the one essential book on the subject and probably the only one you will ever need. I have found it invaluable, and heads above Microsoft's "Windows XP Inside Out". Don't let the term annoyances fool you into thinking that this is just a book about problems encountered with XP, it also contains all the information you will need to make XP work the way you want, including:<p>How to avoid some serious problems with installation;<br>Differences from other Windows versions;<br>Ways to customize Windows not found in Microsoft's book;<br>And yes, all the quirks and pitfalls that make XP "annoying" compared to previous systems, and how to work around these annoyances.</span>

                    <span>Any quick search for XP customization books and you quickly see that there are several around the 1000 page mark and with high user markings.  Given this, there is only so much you can expect from a book half that size.  However, despite other people's opinion on the information covered in this book, if you are looking for a fun and faster read which does actually target the portions of the operating system that most home users would like to cover, this is a perfect choice.<p>The biggest appreciations I have for this title is that the word "hack" never appears, the customizations are not 100% dependent on shareware or freeware downloads, the user is not sheltered from the realities of configuring the OS, and the range of configuration varies from novice to advanced - keeping the reader from stagnating at a particular level.<p>To weigh in on the decision to purchase this title, consider that not only does the title give you the ability to alter your environment, the author has dedicated space to educate the reader on how to identify and troubleshoot problems - a skill really needed and a topic quite often skipped by other titles.  The book also ties in with the authors web site, which makes mentioned downloads easily accessible to the user, adding value to the static text with dynamic content.<p>Although this title differs slightly in overall feel from previous "Annoyances" titles (advancements in the OS are bound to reduce the need), this stands on it's own and is a very good addition to your XP library.</span>

                    <span>I bought this book with more expectation than what I got when I received it in the mail.  I needed to fix the slow bootup of Windows XP and there is hardly anything mentioned in this book about it.  The negative tone of voice and his opinon of how to do things in XP do not help the book either.  He seems to not like Microsoft products very well so he critizes how they made Windows XP with extra effects, just for marketing purposes when they are quite interesting to me and I'm sure others too.  The spelling errors aren't too good either and it shows how little time he put into proof reading it before it was published, thus showing how little he cared.  His knowledge is questionable now too since he is careless on the spelling mistakes and grammar errors too.  I knew I should have bought the Microsoft Windows XP Inside/Out.  I recommend that over this lousy book which is of not much help for people who know a lot about computers.</span>

                    <span>Windows XP Annoyances takes you under the hook of Windows XP (both Pro and Home) to tweak the operating system in ways you may never have thought possible.  The author dives into not only the simple hacks, such as disabling autoplay or speeding up the appearance of menus and changing display properties, but also goes into the Registry to show you tweaks for advanced items such as changing the memory used for I/O operations, and protecting file type associations from changing.<p>Though the book does have a habit of jumping around a bit, and there is no real clear organization of the topics, it is a good reference for those who really want to get into the OS itself and remove some of the "annoying" things (like the cute themes Microsoft has decided to push upon us).  It's also a great reference for those who are attempting to setup home networks, or login to their computer remotely -- the author does more than tweak, he explains about these features that might otherwise be overlooked.<p>Overall, the book is a good buy for the advanced computer user.  Beginners and casual users might be better off utilizing less powerful resources as this book can overwhelm if you do not understand the technical details of Windows XP.</span>
