The legendary Harvey Penick, who began his golfing career as a caddie in Austria, Texas, at the age of eight, worked with an amazing array of champions over the course of nearly a century, dispensing invaluable wisdom to golfers of every level. Penick simplifies the technical jargon of other instructional books and communicates the very essence of the game, and his <I>Little Red Book</I> is full of inspiration and homespun wisdom that reflects at once his great love of golf as well as his great talent for teaching.</span>

                    <span>Yes....that's right....I said it is one of the greatest books ever written on golf and I stand by that....I first read it years ago, and ya know when I read it most recently? Last week! My golf game was struggling...anyone who plays knows there is so much technical jargon to think about, and once all these thoughts enter your head, you're done for! That's where the legend Mr. Penick comes in. Forget about rotating this part of your body 90 degress and your ankle must be at a 32 degree angle and so forth....Take dead aim! Get the negativity out of your head, remember a few SIMPLE methods to hit the ball, and as Taylor Made once advertised, Find Your Game! My game was gone...I was hopeless and didn't know what to do with myself....I saw the book on my shelf, read it (very easy read), and my next opponent better be ready! If you love golf, and you wanna read a book that just makes sense (and provides a lot of inspiration) this book is highly recommended. A man's entire life experience with the game he loved is in this book...treat it with respect...heed the words....and the next putt you drop you might find yourself looking up at the heavens saying "thank you Harvey!"</span>

                    <span>The day I received The Little Red Book the magic began. I never thought that I could still improve my game at the age of 53. But from a weekly average score of 92 for a long time and suddenly drops to a 76 (3 rounds already)then it must be magic. The book is so easy to read and the "tips" are so easy to understand and follow. Anybody who has the time to practice the "tips" of Mr. Penick will surely improve his game tremendously.Now I understand why Mr. Penick is considered one of the greatest (if not the greatest) golf teachers who ever lived. To me the "Little Red Book" is magic.</span>

                    <span>This book covers everything you need to know to improve your game. Mr. Pennick's insights are quick and concise. This is ibe of the best instructional books I have ever read. The only advice I have to give is to take one tip at a time. Pick one thing to work on, when you feel you have achieved what Mr. Pennick said, then move on to something new. The tips are also sprinkled with tales of yesteryear and legends of the game. It is difficult to read this without wanting to put the book down and try each tip as it comes along, I would say read the book once, then go back and work on the things that made hte most sense to you.<P>T</span>

                    <span>HARVEY PENICK'S LITTLE RED BOOK: LESSONS AND TEACHINGS FROM A LIFETIME OF GOLF is a must have for any serious golf library. Filled with anecdotes, stories and practical golf advice, Penick's book is a forthright, enjoyable read. No wonder these lessons had such an impact on the likes of golf greats Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, both of whom were Penick proteges.<P>Penick's book also lends a classical look at a classical game. With all that's going on in the world of golf today: the exorbitant salaries, conflicts about equipment and vintage courses becoming too short, Penick's book reminds us that once upon a time golf was a genial game instead of a rabid business. Read it and gain some needed perspective on the greatest game in the world.<P>THE HORSEMAN</span>
