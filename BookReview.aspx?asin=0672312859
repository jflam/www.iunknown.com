                    <span>Charlie is an extremely engaging writer in many ways. His philosophy of programming is great reading, and the book simply covers areas (such as Corba programming) that other books do not. For this reason alone, it will be valuable to many.<P>The book is not a reference book, and in fact assumes a lot is already known by the reader. It is 'pitched' at the experienced intermediate-advanced reader, and in many respects is quite terse.<P>If you are a programmer interested in advanced topics, the book will likely be invaluable. If you are a beginner get Kent Reisdorph's 'Teach yourself Delphi 4 (+x) in 21 days' before moving on to the extremely useful Delphi 4 (+x) Developers Guide or Marco Cantu's 'Mastering Delphi 4 (+x)'.<P>Having said all that, it's a useful addition to your bookshelf after the other books, and another perspective which cannot hurt. <P>If you are on the cutting edge and know Delphi though, you may find this one of the top books around.</span>

                    <span>I am new to Delphi with less than 3 months of hands on Delphi experience, but I have over 10 years of programming experience. This book showed me all of the features I needed to accomplish my project tasks and then some. Chapters on the Internet, COM, COBRA were very well written and easy to read, but with rich content. I highly recommend this book to any serious Delphi programmer.</span>

                    <span>Having read several good (and some not so good) books on Delphi, I would have to say that this book has some of the best content that I have seen. It is not for the Delphi developer just starting out. It does provide good insight into several of the more difficult aspects of Delphi and Windows programming. Several of the sections (including Calvert's discussion of COM) proved to be very valuable. His writing style is very straight-forward and he gives many examples in the book to help reinforce the topics discussed.</span>

                    <span>If you have completed using the excellent book Delphi Bible by Tom Swan, than this title should definitively be your next book that you will need to work with.<P>Charlie's style of writing is nothing short of brilliant. The writing style is very lucid and the complete book is highly structured and flows very smoothly. Having said that, you do not necessarily have to follow the book religiously from one chapter to another. Unlike tutorial books, where the current chapter builds upon the previous chapter, Charlie's book takes a diametrically opposite way of teaching you Delphi. A complete subject is treated in every chapter, which makes it considerably more useful for an intermediate to advanced developer.<P>Some very important chapters are provided on the CD which does require you to take the time to print them.<P>In summary - take my words, get the book, work with it and I can assure you that you will end up being if not an excellent Delphi programmer at least a well informed developer of Delphi's Advanced features.</span>
