                <span id="Label1">The Harvest of Sorrow is the first full history of one of the most horrendous human tragedies of the 20th century. Between 1929 and 1932 the Soviet Communist Party struck a double blow at the Russian peasantry: dekulakization, the dispossession and deportation of millions of peasant families, and collectivization, the abolition of private ownership of land and the concentration of the remaining peasants in party-controlled "collective" farms.  This was followed in 1932-33 by a "terror-famine," inflicted by the State on the collectivized peasants of the Ukraine and certain other areas by setting impossibly high grain quotas, removing every other source of food, and preventing help from outside--even from other areas of the Soviet Union--from reaching the starving populace.  The death toll resulting from the actions described in this book was an estimated 14.5 million--more than the total number of deaths for all countries in World War I.  <P>Ambitious, meticulously researched, and lucidly written, The Harvest of Sorrow is a deeply moving testament to those who died, and will register in the Western consciousness a sense of the dark side of this century's history.</span>

                    <span>Harvest of Sorrow is an important book for any age. Meticulous, rich with history, but refreshingly unemotional, Conquest knows and writes of the Soviet Union in a way that will bring everyone who reads this book to a much closer understanding of what really went on economically, and the twisted fates of 20 million people under communist manipulation and control . All that has helped bring mother Russia to the point she is today. In chaos and turmoil, and on her knees. This book should play an important role in every high school civics class today, and find its way to the reading tables of anyone interested in the economics and agricultural systems of communism.<P>We were so moved by this book and another timeless classic - The Road to Serfdom by F. A. Hayek that we also felt compelled to create a web page just for these type of books because we feel that many people may not yet have a clear understanding of what communism is (and was)all about. From what we've learned here, we have to say we "thought" we knew, but found we didn't have the actual bottom line until we'd digested this material.</span>

                    <span>Robert Conquest characterizes rightly the Ukranian genocide perpetrated by the CP under Stalin as 'one of the most dreadful periods of modern times'. (A. Koestler: 'starving children looked like embryos out of alcohol bottles'.)<BR>He clearly explains the reader that it was an ideological as well as a political scheme; ideological, because it aimed at replacing private agriculture (the kulaks) by collective farms; political, because it aimed at crushing the Ukranian minority. The result was about 15 million deaths through deportation, starvation or direct liquidation.<BR>This book contains excellent historical, political and ideological (Marx, Engels) background on the collectivization problem which would haunt the USSR until his final days: bureaucratization and rampant inefficiency.<BR>Robert Conquest's book gives us an appalling picture of Lenin's terror reign and, after his death, of the power struggle at the top of the CP. The outcome was that one man through one party wielded totally uncontrolled power in an enormous country. He had even the power to inflict genocides without having to justify himself.<BR>This book shows the USSR as a ghost state (reflected in the media) where all contact with reality was lost, as so brilliantly described in Ismail Kadare's novels. For the bureaucrats terror and obedience to any order from above became a normal method of administration.<BR>When one ultimately askes why and how all those, humanly speaking, devastating facts could happen, I should remind the last words of Prof. David Chandler's magisterial book on Pol Pot's death camp 'Voices from S-21': 'the real truth ... is to be found in ourselves'.<BR>The Ukranian genocide is not unique in the 20th century with its Nazi camps, Indonesian, Rwandan, Armenian or Bosnian mass killings.<BR>A terrible but necessary book.<BR>I should also recommend a prime eye-witness of this tragedy: Miron Dolot's 'The Hidden Holocaust'.</span>

                    <span>Conquest's examination of Stalin's calamitous decision to collectivize agriculture in the Soviet Union is not an easy read, nor should it be. It is a worthy companion to the author's great work on Stalin's reign of terror in the '30s, and in fact serves as a "prequel" to the latter, having been published some 15 years later.<P>The great strength of the work lies in Conquest's meticulous efforts to explicate the roots of the communist regime's ruthless murder of millions of peasants. He details Marx's and, more importantly, Lenin's disdain for the peasantry, an underlying hatred that helps to explain Stalin's justification for departing from Lenin's pragmatic decision to embark on a "New Economic Policy" in 1921 that -- against his ideological bias -- offered new freedoms that spawned the despised class known as the Kulaks. Without this groundwork, one is tempted to dismiss the human destruction as the mere abberations of a sick mind. <P>Conquest makes abundantly clear that these supposedly fabulously wealthy farmers -- the Kulaks -- were in fact people of very modest means. Their greatest crime, of course, was that they obstinately resisted Stalin's determination that capitalism would be wiped from the countryside, whatever the cost. Much of the last half of the book recounts in stark detail the incredibly costly, but ultimately successful, effort to end peasant resistance to collectivization. Importantly, he points out, even after all realistic Kulak "resistance" had been eliminated, the Soviets continued to claim that the threat continued and extended their seasons of murder. And even for the most coldly pragmatic, he also convincingly argues that the collectivization was an unmitigated economic disaster that killed incentive and left nearly barren a countryside that in the hands of an intelligent leader should have been turned into one of the most productive in the world.<P>If one were to ask, what is the point of reading and recalling this hideous chapter in Russian and human history, one might just as well ask, why remember the Holocaust? While the circumstances of human history may change, the motivations that drive individuals remain quite consistent. Stalin, in the end, shrugged off the Marxist theory to which he professed he was committed in favor of the naked pursuit of power. Economic theory served as nothing more than a justification for the slaughter of millions of human beings. Leaders who in the future aspire to the kind of local and world power that Hitler and Stalin achieved will reveal their motivations to those who are vigilant, and it will be to humanity's great profit if those with sufficient awareness and foresight are able to thwart those efforts.</span>

                    <span>We have heard so many excuses for the disaster that we call Soviet communism that one can almost recite them by heart - communism has never been tried, communism rescued citizens from the "tyanny" of the tsar (this is so pathetic as to be beyond laughable), communism had the wrong people, wrong methods, wrong country, blah, blah, blah. <P>Soviet collectivism is nowhere better illustrated than in the largest mass killing in the history of the world when over 14 million Ukranians were starved, shot and beaten to death by that "rescuing" crew - Lenin, Stalin & Company. This, of course, does not include the millions killed in the Civil War and the years directly afterwards. And if it were left up to Western intellectuals to highlight this holocaust we would still be waiting for news much less disapproval or blame.<P>Robert Conquest's tome reads like a documentary, describing a madness that one does not associate with civilized nations or people. But he is relentlessly systematic, the research and evidence overwhelming and mindnumbing. This methodical and studious approach is much more effective than anguished calls for revenge. Perhaps the magnitude of the event is too great to grasp for some, is so far beyond the pale that it surpasses the senses. <P>But that fact does not explain why even today the Soviet system has never come in for a tenth of the criticism of Nazi Germany despite committing five to six times the number of murders if over a longer time span. Worse, the regime had intellectual support in the West even after it's crimes were discovered - from the New York Times correspondent in Moscow to the usual bevy of college professors and "activists".<P>Conquest is measured but in this case the words and actions alone do not need shouting. In more poetic hands, this could have been a requiem - instead we have a lesson for the ages.</span>
