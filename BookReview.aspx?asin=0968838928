                <span id="Label1">This best-selling beautiful guide book to the cruising experience in Alaska includes over 350 maps, illustrations and photos - most in color. The new 4th edition of Alaska by Cruise Ship also has a giant pull-out color map, updated port maps and a whale watching map. Updated in 2002.   <P>Veteran cruise writer Anne Vipond, with years of experience cruising the Inside Passage and the Gulf of Alaska, provides an insider's look at this beautiful coastline. Drawing on authorities at the Universities of Alaska and British Columbia, this is a reliable reference for passengers. From Seattle and Vancouver to the south to Seward, Anchorage, Fairbanks and Kodiak to the north. Read about Alaska's Russian past, the rough and tumble years of the Gold Rush and the renaissance of Northwest native culture. A detailed chapter of the book deals with the diverse wildlife and also includes special maps to help you locate and identify the different species of whales. Also in this updated edition are all port attractions with maps showing exactly where cruise ships dock as well as comprehensive shore excursion information and suggestions for those who want to explore each port on foot. Home port information also includes hotel recommendations and land tour information.</span>

                    <span>I just got back from Alaska (June 04) this book had great information.  I definitely recommend getting it a MONTH before your cruise and reading it through.  Getting it the day before is a little late  :(</span>

                    <span>Excellent coverage of Alaskan ports, including most of the minor ports visited by smaller ships.  Essential for the Alaska-bound travelers who wish to maximize their experience in ports of call.  By using the walking guides and descriptions of attractions, readers will be able to visit the high points of each port, and skip destinations with less appeal.  Helps to cut down on the expense of shore excursions by suggesting interesting alternatives.  Also assists you to choose the correct shore excursion for your interests.  If you're traveling to Alaska, this is an essential companion.  Also contains information on weather, dress, culture, and what to expect in general.  Many maps and illustrations add an additional dimension of clarity to the excellent text.  - Steve Pickering at DoctorCruise.com</span>

                    <span>This is all you need to plan your time while on your Alaska cruise.  I wanted a book that would enable me to make decisions about where to go when in port, what to see, what to not bother with, and how to amuse myself and my family.  Like everybody taking a cruise, we wanted to get as much out of it as possible!  This book is an indispensable guide to what you will see on your Alaska cruise.  It describes the various ports of call, has maps of the towns, suggestions for what to do with your free time, what not to miss.  Having this book precluded me from lugging around 3 different books and grabbing all those touristy brochures along the way.  Have you chosen Alaska for your cruise destination?  Then take this book along.  Highly recommended.</span>

                    <span>Anne Vipond's straightforward style, well-conceived organization, and excellent content make this book indispensable for Alaska-bound cruisers.  Anne patiently describes all the major cruise ports in Alaska and the  Inside Passage.  The detailed town maps with keys to the text descriptions  are excellent.  Descriptions of various attractions meaty, yet brief.  The  thing that is most attractive about this book is its focus on activities  interesting to cruisers, as opposed to the long list of hotels and  restaurants common in other guide books.  Anyone taking a cruise to Alaska  will find this book invaluable.  It seems to be the only reference  available that provides assistance in planning your trip to make maximum  benefit from your time in each port.</span>
