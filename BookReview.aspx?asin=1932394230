                <span id="Label1"><div>A cookbook for building better Java applications, this book contains 150 recipes for better code, using JUnit as both a testing and design tool. Each recipe is a short, self-contained article that answers questions about how to use JUnit, from taking the first steps to testing complex J2EE applications, including servlets, JSPs, EJBs, and JMS components. For developers that want to use JUnit on a new project, information on how to design easy-to-test applications is provided, helping avoid the design pitfalls of many legacy applications. For those that need to start testing an existing application, recipes dedicated to testing even the most difficult legacy components, such as EJBs and JDBC code, are also provided.<br></div></span>

                    <span>This thick volume (700 pages including good references and reading list) is aimed at three groups: Java developers in general, JUnit users, and lastly software testers. It is very useful to all three groups, and is marked as **** as a software tester (am I in a minority of one?). It may merit top marks for the other two readership groups.
<br />
<br />JUnit is one of a series of language-dependent packages for those engaged in Test Driven Development. Important points to draw out are that this is describing both the building blocks for JUnit, and a process. The authors (important contributions from Scott Stirling and others, in addition to J. B. Rainsberger) make little in the way of assumptions. Not every reader will be an expert Java programmer, nor will everyone have used JUnit before. 
<br />
<br />Starting from the notion of building little tests as coding progresses, some tough questions are introduced early-on. How is production code to be separated from testing code? It is great having a fully rounded regression pack available, but is it possible to invoke only a subset of the tests available? Real questions from genuine situations that scratch where it itches! All this from the three principles of JUnit; create an object, invoke a method and test the result. Practical examples abound, and there are coded examples, for the most part very clear. Later on, some parts were beyond my level of Java technical understanding (particularly testing JavaBeans), but some testing points still emerge.
<br />
<br />To build in the future-proofing of test packs, 're-factoring' is mentioned both early, and often. There are also some very common testing items. Here is one for a taster: if a module / class / object has no noticeable effect, why test it (and perhaps more pertinently, why code it!) There is also the idea that some items are not building blocks, and are too simple to test. This is surely worth considering. 
<br />
<br />Development can learn from testing. This volume shows that all the traffic is not one way, and is a valuable addition to (some of) those engaged in software development.

                    <span>A JUnit monster book! Detail after detail after detail... Such a amazing thing to see some many tips bounded together. But that's not all, rick background knowledge behind all those tips make it fit for all level readers.  The only thing I would like to see more is about Mock from J. B, which definitely deserves at least one separate chapter.  That's why I give 4 stars.  Overall, this is really a master piece!</span>

                    <span>What can I say? JUnit Recipes is a great book among great books on the subject of Test-driven Development. J.B. Rainsberger spends about 20% of the book discussing JUnit in depth and then spends the rest of his time going over different Java technologies that need testing and how to accomplish that task in an organized and methodical fashion. JUnit may be the most popular testing framework for Java, but the author also spends time discussing JUnit-based frameworks like Cactus, JUnitPP and MockEJB.
<br />
<br />What I liked the most: when the author selects an area to discuss he discusses it from many different angles. For example, when developing server-side components it may be advantageous to test outside of the server environment and at other times inside the server environment. J.B. Rainsberger covers as many facets of the various testing scenarios as possible.
<br />
<br />What I liked the least (well, not so much what I didn't like as what I would have liked to have seen): in a book of this depth it would have been nice to see a web-based application with the various testing layers in place using Ant or Maven scripts to run the tests over the development-life of the example. I keep hoping to run into a tutorial like that, but the sheer scope of the example may be too much to cover without short-changing other areas.
<br />
<br />The Reading List in the back of the book is also first rate.
<br />
<br />Overall, I enjoyed the parts of the book I have read and I expect to keep this book on the short list of books I recommend to my colleagues.</span>

                    <span>JUnit. Nearly every Java developer has heard of it and many use it, but it is hard to say that it is used to its full potential. Sure, it is easy to set up and use in a basic way, but what happens when you want to extend it or use it in an unfamiliar way? You could just leap in try to figure it out yourself, but if you do, chances are, you'll be rediscovering something that J.B. Rainsberger has learned and documented in JUnit Recipes.
<br />
<br />JUnit Recipes is a front-to-back roadmap of JUnit use. It is clearly written and it contains a wealth of information. This past week, I was creating an extension for FIT which runs JUnit tests, and I kept pulling J.B.'s book off my shelf. Finally, I stopped putting it back and left it on my desk. I think that was the right move because nearly every time I picked it up, I dog-eared another two pages.
<br />
<br />J.B.'s advice is very good. It goes far beyond the mechanics of JUnit and its extensions. It extends to very direct concrete advice about testing. I recommend that everyone who uses JUnit get a copy. If you are like 90% of the JUnit users out there, you use JUnit but you aren't really using JUnit; not in the way that you will after reading this.</span>
