                    <span>This guide was an invaluable resource for making the best of a week at Yellowstone. It was like carrying a park ranger in your pocket (just much less weight). First of all, the first few pages have trails listed by both (1) location in the park (Yellowstone is LARGE) and by difficulty. These lists include highlights of each trail. Approximately 30 trails are described in detail. For each trail, roundtrip distance, elevation change, difficulty level, and expected duration (hours) is listed along with a brief description, potential hazards, direction to the trailhead, and best times of year to hike. Subsequently, a detailed naturalist's description of the trail is provided. These notes are perfect for planning your hikes of using as a step-by-step guide for reading as you hike. The authors provide details about wildlife, flora & fauna, geology, history, and scenery along each trail. Each trails has a full-page easy-to-read contour map that provides the hiker with information on elevation changes and other useful details. As if the trail descriptions didn't already make you want to hike every trail, the guide provides a color photo from each trail making me wish I had time to hike the entire guide. The Anderson book also provides lists of what to bring on day hikes as well as tips for hiking in grizzly country. If a day hike for you is 15-20 miles or more, consider the Marschall book on Yellowstone trails (keep in mind, the first description of a trail often comes 5-10 miles into it). Trails you don't want to miss: Mt. Washburn, Storm Point, Avalanche Peak, Yellowstone Grand Canyon Rim (either or both), Pelican Creek, Trout Lake. We had the pleasure of meeting Ranger Carol Anderson (co-author) at the Lake Visitor Center - she spent an hour reviewing hikes with us. These folks know their stuff - I highly recommend this book for the average day hiker.</span>
