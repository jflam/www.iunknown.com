                    <span>This book wasn't just good, it was brilliant. So far, this is my favorite Madeline L'Engle book because she combines her own personal reflections with her fascinating fiction in a book that was hard to put down. I had to check the date twice to see that it was published in 1984....I was like, "Are you kidding, me?" It reads like it's more contemporary and timely than ever and that is always a good sign with any book (stand the test of time). <P>I heard about this book through a friend of a friend whom I didn't know and went out on a limb and bought it....and now, I think I may have found another author (apart from Brennan Manning) who is so challenging, insightful and exhilerating, you can't help but sit back, breathe deep and simply thank God for her words.</span>

                    <span>This wonderful book is Madeline L'Engle's meditations on the Gospel of John and Genesis and how her sprituality relates to her life, bound up in a tale of her sea voyage on a freighter. It reads like much of her fiction, engaging rather than didactic. She does take some unusual approaches to the stories in Genesis, some of which I found a little disturbing, but basically I loved this book, and have reread it many times.</span>
