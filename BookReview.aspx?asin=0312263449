                <span id="Label1">With a love of travel, Alison Wearing invites us to journey with her to Iran--a country that few Westerners have a chance to see. Traveling with a male friend, in the guise of a couple on their honeymoon, Wearing set out on her own at every available opportunity. She went looking for what lay beneath the media's representation of Iran and found a country made up of welcoming, curious, warmhearted, ambitious men and women. With humor and compassion, Wearing gives Iranians the chance to wander beyond headlines and stereotypes, and in doing so, reveals the poetry of their lives--those whose lives extend beyond Western news stories of kidnapping, terrorism, veiled women, and Islamic fundamentalism.<br></span>

                    <span>I loved this book. It was a delight and a privilege to experience Iran through Allison Wearing's eyes and ears, through her warm heart and beautiful mind. She limits herself to writing only what amuses, entertains, edifies, enlightens her readers, and never never bores--sharing her frustrations, hilarity, surprises, confusion, fear, joy, fatigue, admiration.... Iran's people treat her well and win her affection and respect, and she in turn treats them with the utmost respect and openness; yet she clearly conveys the difficulties and drawbacks of daily life there. She wears Hejab for five months (the black coverings of Muslim women) and sympathetically investigates and illuminates the lives of Iranian women. Wearing's writing style is simply the best--present, funny, thoughtful, gentle, informed, with stories and characters that are irresistable. I appreciate her political and cultural sensitivity, and am very grateful that she took me along on her journey..... I plan to recommend this book to my book club!</span>

                    <span>This is absolutely one of the most unbiased, open-minded "outsider" views on modern-day Iran that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Alison Wearing went into Iran with an open mind and an open heart, and a double dollop of tenacity and courage. She emerges a person who has viewed the country the news media doesn't want us to see. This is the country of total strangers who invite you to stay and dine at their house; of people who are concerned with whether you find the restrictions of their country pleasant or stifling; and, the story of other ex-patriots who have made their home in this land, and how they view it as outsiders who have become insiders, as much as possible.<P>There are fascinating stories in this book, including the author's day spent escaping the stifling heat of the city with nomads in the mountains, including a 12-year old girl who is married but unable to consummate the marriage since she hasn't finished puberty. In Shiraz, Wearing meets a British woman who is raising her teenaged daughter with her Iranian husband. She bemoans her nieces in England who are struggling with teenage pregnancies, while her daughter is getting straight A's and planning for college. Not every story is positive, including the incident on the bus to Syria, which raises Wearing's ire. But, people are people no matter where you go. And, the majority of people she meets are a far cry from what anyone would expect.<P>I highly recommend this book, and have loaned my copy to several people so far. It tells things I experienced as the wife of an Iranian in that country, but is even more interesting because Alison Wearing is truly viewing this world as an observer.</span>

                    <span>As a person who reads a lot of books about the middle east, specifically about middle eastern women, I was delighted to find that this book wasn't written with a strong political agenda. I was beginning to get weary of books that railed nonstop against hejab, and even though Alison Wearing does complain about it, she also describes the feeling of comfort and safety it affords her, probably mirroring an ambivalence many Iranian women have.<BR>I don't agree with the first reviewers criticism that the book implies that the only way into Iran is by bus, and that it makes Iranians look poor because they have no furniture. I might be biased because I'm more familiar with Iranian culture, but these things didn't suggest that to me. The author was obviously an adventurous sort who preferred the bus, and would people so graspingly poor that they couldn't afford furniture be able to lavish gifts and food on strangers in the way she describes? i think the above reviewer was a little oversensitive about how Iranaians are portrayed.<BR>I loved that the book emphasized the intensely hospitable and friendly nature of the Iranian people- an element I've found sadly lacking in books that just like to focus on what is wrong with the culture. The book has its flaws (when Wearing gets poetic, she sounds a little sily, but fortunately this is rare), but her funny voice, honesty (she knows when she is being culturally insensitive, and doesn't gloss over it), and gift for writing believeable dialogue more than make up for it. A fun, funny, and touching read.</span>

                    <span>Let me start by saying that my father is Iranian, and that I have visited Iran several times. I believe that this book captures a lot of the spirit of Iranians. I recognized patterns of behavior in the people described by the author from my own experiences with the Iranian half of my family both in Iran and here in America. I found several misrepresentations in the stories, though. Taking a three day bus trip from Turkey is one way to enter Iran, but the author never mentions that you can get a flight to Tehran from many European cities that only takes a few hours. She makes the entire country seem almost impossible to access. She completely glossed over her time in Tehran, where life is often drastically different than in the smaller cities she visited. Her references to people's lack of furniture made them seem poor, when in fact, it is part of the culture to eat and sleep on the floor. I have two female cousins in Tehran who are doctors, but the average reader would probably think that such a career choice was impossible for Iranian women if this was the only book they read about the country. Overall, this was an interesting read, but I don't recommend it as a comprehensive guide to Iran. Read it if you already know some facts about Iran and want to get a feel for the people.</span>

                    <span>This is a very good book about a Westerner's experience in the mystery called Iran. Even though Ms. Wearing proves to be a rather naive and not-so-sensitive tourist towards the culutures and sentiments of Iranians, she has a sincere and refreshing view.<BR>The fact that Ms. Wearing focuses on people only and does not discuss any details about the rich history, culture, monuments and places that make Iran so unique and draw thousands of tourists every year was a bit disappointing. However, I consider this as Ms. Wearing's personal intention and idea and respect her for this particular decision. <BR>It should be noted, however, that she mostly interacts with small-town Iranian citizens who are a world different than almost one-third of the population living in big cities with a very different lifestyle. Being a "big city" Iranian myself, I felt something missing there.<BR>Ms. Wearing has a great sense of humor and proves to be an amusing storyteller. I salute her for a job well done.</span>
