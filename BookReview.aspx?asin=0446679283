                    <span>I am a beginner triathlete and I really thought this book covered the basics and then some. I am a marathoner so I didn't really go over the running section but the bike and swim sections were great for learning basics and getting some drill and cycling advice. <BR>However, the one obvious thing missing in this book for me was training schedules. Not one in the whole book! That is really what I was looking for as a beginner because I didn't quite know how to structure my workouts on a daily basis. I did find quite a few training schedules on the internet though, and I recently bought a book with training schedules in it, so it wasn't a big deal. I found this book to be very complete in all other aspects of the triathlon so far.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the few books that really gives you some guidelines in how to put a training routine together. It explains in detail what to do according to the distance that you will be doing. It divides it according to your current fitness level, and according to the triathlon's distance. I reviewed several books in order to "get help" on as how to put a routine together, this was the best one by far. So, I really think this is a very useful book.</span>
