                <span id="Label1">Reissued in celebration of the tenth anniversary of its original publication, featuring a new preface, Mountain Light: In Search of the Dynamic Landscape is the best-selling classic that captures the unique artistic vision of Galen Rowell, one of the world's foremost outdoor photographers.<P>Galen Rowell has devoted his life to photography, mountaineering, writing, and adventure. A frequent contributor to Life, National Geographic, Outside, Sports Illustrated, and many other publications both here and abroad, his award-winning work has been widely exhibited and praised. Among his many honors is the Ansel Adams Award for his outstanding contribution to outdoor photography. A recent recipient of a National Science Foundation grant to document the Antarctic, he is the author of many celebrated works including: The Yosemite, Mountains of the Middle Kingdom, In the Throne Room of the Mountain Gods, My Tibet, and most recently, Galen Rowell's Vision: The Art of Adventure Photography. He lives with his wife, Barbara, in Northern California.<P>"One could call Mountain Light the classiest 'how-to' text on landscape color photography ever published. [It] will leave you delighted." The New York Times<P>"Part personal and artistic biography, part adventure story, part outdoor photography manual, [Mountain Light] is a tour de force. The images are charmed, compelling, imbued with a love of the high and wild."<P>San Francisco Chronicle<P>"Galen Rowell has a wonderful combination of qualities -- eye, energy, intelligence, sensitivity, courage both physical and moral, and above all, heart. Very seldom have I experienced so clearly defined the connection between the artist and what he sees, feels, and does with the work itself." Robert Redford<P>"Combine a devotion to mountains and wilderness, a sensitivity to the special quality of its pristine light, and a desire to communicate the beauty of the natural world, and you'll begin to understand what motivates photographer Galen Rowell .... In [Mountain Light], vision and technique are combined in one long paean to the marvel of the earth's wild places."<P>Popular Photography</span>

                    <span>Galen Rowell was a world-class mountaineer and photographer. He passed away with his wife in an airplane crash on August 11, 2002.<p>He was a master of color landscapes and had the knack of catching unique combinations of light in the memorable photos that can be seen in his Mountain Light Gallery. Interestingly, he eschewed the large format cameras used by Ansel Adams and used exclusively 35mm cameras from Nikon (thus thoroughly debunking the orthodoxy that 35mm cannot be used for serious landscape photography).<p>In this book, Rowell lays out his relation to mountains, his artistic vision and his photographic techniques, in an engaging and lively style alternating between theoretical text and more illustrative intermezzos with detailed descriptions of the story behind each image (reminiscent of Ansel Adams' Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs. Like Ansel Adams, he was a member of the Sierra Club, but ecological preoccupations are woven subtly in the text. He shows a photo taken near a 4900 year old bristlecone pine that was felled by a botanist who couldn't be troubled to special-order a core sampling borer from Switzerland.<p>The photos in the book are gorgeous, but this is no mere coffee-table book (it is too affordable to be one, for starters). All in all, I believe this book is a must-read for anyone interested in landscape photography, even if you are not into the strenuous physical style he favored.</span>

                    </div>
                    <span>The most negative review here is by someone who liked the pictures but hated what the reviewer saw as a demonstration of Rowell's ego in the text.  I liked the text and enjoyed the detailed stories that went along with each picture.  The text does involve Rowell talking about what he thought at the time he took the pictures, but I didn't view it as an unwarranted ego trip, the pictures are beautiful and Rowell need not be apologetic about having taken them.<p>Having said that, the book will do next to nothing for most amateur photographers as far as teaching them skills, a lot of the photographs in circumstances unlikely to be encountered by the weekend photographer.  I guess the major take away is: find a good composition and wait for dusk, or dawn.</span>

                    <span>Galen Rowell's "Mountain Light" teaches beginning, intermediate and even advanced landscape photographers more about "seeing" than any other landscape photography book I have read.  Unlike many other great photographers who cannot explain their craft with great clarity (including the incomparable Henri Cartier-Bresson who simply says it is "geometry"), Rowell is articulate and explains what he is doing technically, but more important artistically.  Rowell has often been compared to the American landscape portrait artist Thomas Cole--but Thomas Cole on his best day could never have produced the quality of art that Galen Rowell gives to us every day.  A lot of books can teach you technique; Rowell shows technique as a part of art.  The art drives the technique and not the other way around. Everyone can learn something useful from this book. A tour de force.</span>

                    <span>This book is a masterpiece.  Galen Rowell adores the natural world and it shows.  The collection of images is the most inspiring I have ever seen.  It could only have been made by someone who spends a lot of time in the wild and loves that world.  The narratives explain the thinking behind each image, from the artistic, geographic and technical perspectives that went into making it.  For anyone interested in photograghing nature, this book is a must!</span>

                    <span>IF you love the mountains and the feeling they give you as you take in their grandeur...or if you love photographing these majestic places, this book will likely become one of your favorites. As a landscape photographer, I've poured over literally thousands of landscape photos - in books, slides and magazines - but the work of Galen Rowell stands alone in the realm of mountain landscapes. As Arthus-Bertrand has mastered photography from above (aerial) and Doubilet from below (undersea), Rowell has mastered the  mountains.<p>If you pay attention to his photos and read what Rowell has to say about the making of each, you will begin to "see the light" - quite literally. No one captures the ethereal like Galen Rowell. He has the rare ability to sense and then photograph those fleeting moments that most (even many photographers) only daydream about. His photos will not only impress your eyes but they will tug at your soul. If ever a collection of photographs defined the majesty and mystery of mountians, this is it.</span>
