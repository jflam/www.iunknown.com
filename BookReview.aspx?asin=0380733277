                    <span>The Mysterious Mattter of I.M. Fine is really a mystery book. It is about a girl named Franny and her friend Beamer who are trying to find out where this mysterious author lives. They have to do lots and lots of research to find out where the author lives. They are trying to find I.M. Fine because she is putting spells in the books she is writing. People get sick or go crazy every time they read her books. Finally, Franny and Beamer find nout where I.M lives. They thought I.M was a man but when they went into I.M.'s house they found out she is a woman. They also found out that I.M had a twin sister that was their teacher in the sixth grade. The twin then talked to I.M and I.M promised to not put anymore spells in her books,but there was just one problem, nobody would buy her books anymore. I thought it was a good book, what about you?</span>

                    <span>When two children, Franny and Beamer become concerned with the behavior of the children at their school, they decide to investigate the mystery behind the children's behavior. What is the connection? Is there a connection? Why are so many children doing the same thing? <P>I read this book with my son as part of his Summer Reading Program. My son enjoyed the copy we borrowed so much that we had to buy our own. It made him think about what and why children do the things they do. It was a fun read for him. I must admit that I'm surprised I actually enjoyed it. The photo on the cover appeared to be very chilling. Once we started reading the book we found it to be very thrilling, full of suspense and humor.</span>

                    <span>Franny and Beamer just don't get the whole I.M. Fine thing. Sure, I.M. Fine's Chillers books are a hit with kids everywhere. But what's so great about them? Something, apparently, because I.M. Fine has become the best-selling children's book author in the country. When jelly worms are featured in a Chillers book, suddenly kids everywhere go crazy, buying tons of jelly worms. That doesn't seem so bad. But then everyone who reads the next Chillers book, about an exploding head, gets a horrible headache that lasts for several days and is cured by nothing. Franny and Beamer are suspicious of I.M. Fine, but they have no proof that the books are causing the strange behavior. Then a Chillers book about ghosts causes kids to think they see ghosts, and one about snakes causes its readers to act like snakes. Franny and Beamer now know I.M. Fine is to blame. They have to stop him or her, but first they have to track this mysterious author down. This was a clever, spooky, and entertaining parody on kids and how they react to fads.</span>
