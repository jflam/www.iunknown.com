                <span id="Label1">An ever-growing number of applications are being developed for the Windows server platform. As more companies come to rely on this burgeoning code base, software developers require the skills to closely integrate with Windows. Administrators resent applications with obvious bugs, but they will also reject code that is difficult to administer, performs poorly, or dominates system resources. <I>Programming Server-Side Applications for Microsoft Windows 2000</I> helps intermediate and advanced Windows programmers by covering a range of topics needed to develop reliable applications for Windows 2000.<p> Readers should be familiar with C++ Windows programming and spend little time introducing basic concepts. Advanced readers will find this refreshing, while beginners should scurry off and bone up by reading the prequel, Jeffrey Richter's <I>Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows</I>. Moreover, although this book covers server-side applications, it spends very little time on network programming--it assumes the reader is already comfortable with sockets or some other form of client/server communication. <p> The sections on services and administration are straightforward, and readers familiar with Windows NT will easily grasp the skills needed to build system-friendly applications. Security is a trickier topic, and the authors do a good job of introducing the different aspects of Windows security, emphasizing the functions that programmers will use most frequently. There is a solid explanation of Windows network authentication and secure communication. (These topics almost warrant a separate book, but there is enough information here to get off to a good start.)<p> The critical nature of server-side applications is emphasized--stressing that it is not acceptable to reboot the server machine regularly if the system grows unstable. Readers get strong advice on the importance of managing resources, easy administration, and scalability. In most cases, these concepts are reinforced with specific examples throughout the text via notes on common pitfalls and bugs, but it would have been nice to see this point hammered home a bit more, especially the difficulty in testing code in a simulated production environment. <p> The best aspect of this book is the exemplary sample code. It is easy to understand and well documented, and it does a good job of demonstrating the topics the book discusses. The companion CD-ROM contains all the code needed to build the sample applications under Visual C++ 6.0, most of which can easily be modified to other uses. Note that much of the information in this book is not specific to Windows 2000--it can be easily applied to Windows NT 4--but new features such as Active Directory are not discussed in any detail. You can use this book to modify existing applications to better integrate with Windows, or to develop new server applications from scratch. If you want a solid tutorial for developing Windows server applications, this will make a nice supplement to your technical library. <I>--Pete Ostenson</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: I/O completion ports and thread pools, Windows service development and administration, managing the Registry, performance counters, event logging, Windows security, user and group management, SSPI, and SSL.</span>

                    <span>This book tells how to use existing Win32 API facilities to write solid and efficient server side apps.  Most Win32 API books just describe GUI API part like Petzold's books do. This book takes you to the point - how to use EventLogging, Threads, IO completion port, security, Sockets, Overlapped IO, Synchronization, etc and why they work this way.  It tells you even more - where most apps losing performance, standard techniques for synchronization, how to monitor system health.  It offers little help for VB and MFC programmers at the same time if your apps should run for weeks and serve thousands requests an hour this is your survival guide.<br>Well, when Win32 about to be succeeded by Win64 we finally got answer how did it work and how we had to use it.</span>

                    <span>I'm doing server-side programming for years and I can state - a few books can match this one.  It covers almost all core Win32 API that involved in server side development in great details.  It is easy enough to read, but required basic CS knowledge.  It was specially written for Win 32 API unlike many other books that been adopted from Win16.  It covers fundamentals - processes, threads, different types IO, event logging, resource management, synchronization security and etc.  This is the stuff that gives C++ advantage over VB on serve-side.  Without it apps should be written in VB to run under COM+.  It even touches Win64 API, but since I never use it I cannot judge it.  It does not cover GUI development.  I wish more information about COM and socket programming.  If you involved in server-side development for high performance apps this book is the best source so far.</span>

                    <span>Everyone knows Richter's "Advanced Windows Programming". OK, so they took that book, and made two books out of it. "Server-Side Apps..." is the second half (the first hald if the new Richter's "Advanced Windows 2000 Programming...". Both books are unconscionably bloated (he he, why would they do that?) and don't seem to add much value above and beyond the old book. In fact, I think, both books are too big and that is because of the presence of material that doesn't really need to be there--security, services, stuff like that. I say, if you got the latest old one, don't bother with these two, especially considering the cost.</span>

                    <span>This book should really be calling "Programming Secure Services for Windows 2000".  Its not about server-side applications in general; rather, a specific implementation of them... a Microsoft Back-Office certified implentation to be precise.  The first half covers creating, installing, and administering a service.  The second half covers security. <p>That said, this is a good book if you are looking to make a service and are concerned about security.  If you don't know what a service is, then you probably don't need this book.  But I'll tell you what it is just in case :)  The book defines it as "a normal Windows application containing additional infrastructure that enables it to receive special treatment by the operating system".  ie You can see it as a 'snap-in' under the "Computer Management/Services and Applications/Services" directory in MMC.  From there, you can start, stop, and administer your service.  In essence, you are creating a background process that has no GUI.  MMC takes care of that for you.<p>Using VC++ and named pipes, the authors give you plenty of examples of services and clients.  A perfect follow up to "Applications for Windows 4th ed".  Recommended but for a limited audience.</span>
